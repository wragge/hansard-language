* But if the effect of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision invalidating parts of the trade practices legislation is in some way to affect the repeal' in 1965 so that the Australian Industries Preservation Act is restored, the purpose and effect of this subclause is quite conclusively to indicate that it is the intention of this legislation, as it was the intention of the 1965 legislation, to repeal the Australian Industries Preservation Act.

* I content myself with expressing the Government's appreciation of the fact that the Opposition will not stand in the way of the passage of this Bill, which goes some of the way towards achieving the Government's goal in respect of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#debate-51)

* I would suggest that also, apart from that, the fact that this is dealing with the situation of a member of the Australian Parliament makes it appropriate that it should go to a federal court, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, the highest court in the land, to be dealt with.

* I suggest that the proposition advanced on this Bill that matters of importance such as this should be the consideration of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is consistent with the view which this Government has always advanced, and I can see nothing that we have to explain in clause 5 of the Bill which provides that original jurisdiction is conferred on the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in suits under this Act and no other court has jurisdiction in such a suit.

* I realise that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is the Court of Disputed Returns, but I do not think that an offence of this sort should warrant trial by a justice of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, which would interrupt the appellate duties for which such judges should be reserved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0)

* I would have thought that it was wholly contrary to the outlook upon the jurisdiction that should be developed today for this original jurisdiction to be vested in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* Yet, the Prime Minister and the Government of this country wish us, as representatives of the people who are paying the tax, to come along here and to agree to it because the Government has allowed the situation to develop to the stage where, as  Senator Greenwood  says, it is dishonest in that some people have paid the tax thinking that they ultimately will be liable to pay it in spite of the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* Although since the inception of the Constitution power has been granted to the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate with respect to trading and financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in 1909 had the practical effect of deterring the Commonwealth Parliament from legislating in that respect because of the belief that the legislative power was virtually useless.

* But as we move further from the time of the actual setting down of the Constitution, and as there is a consistent and persistent refusal to re-look at the Constitution by way of referenda or constitutional amendment of some kind or another, more and more the area of power is moving from this Parliament into judicial tribunals, and it was left to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to make this very big advance for Australia.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0)

* I also pointed out that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> had made it clear that the corporations power in section 51(xx) of the Constitution could be used to support legislation dealing with the restrictive trade practices of corporations and that the Government had accordingly decided that the immediate remedial legislation should be founded on that power alone.

* Although certain provisions of the Trade Practices Act dealing with resale price maintenance were subsequently declared to be valid by the Commonwealth Industrial Court there are substantial parts of the Act which have been rendered wholly inoperative by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0)

* This has been done in order to avoid problems of the kind disclosed by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and, by facilitating the drafting, to avoid undersirable delay in the introduction of the Bill.

 Mr Deputy President, as I have made clear, the present Bill is a holding measure to deal as a matter of urgency with the immediate effects of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision in the concrete pipes case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0)

* The purpose of this Bill is to rectify a situation under the Matrimonial Causes Act disclosed by  2  recent decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0)

* However, last December the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> held, in the case of Kotsis v. Kotsis, that the Registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales was not part of that Court but was merely an officer of it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0)

* The decision in Kotsis v. Kotsis was followed, in May of this year, by a further decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the case of Knight v. Knight, which related to the position of the Master of the Supreme Court of South Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> held that the position of the Master of that Court was indistinguishable from that of the Registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and that, accordingly, the Master lacked jurisdiction to make orders of the kind he had for some time been making. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision in Knight v. Knight also cast doubt on a South Australian practice in accordance with which persons appointed as commissioners of the Supreme Court - usually retired judges - have purported to exercise the jurisdiction of the Court in granting divorce decrees and making related orders. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0)

* In the case of Knight v. Knight no order was actually made by a court officer, the matter having been raised for the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s consideration by way of a case stated by a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0)

* However, in the many cases to which the Bill will apply, it will provide for the rights of persons to be as it was  intended that they should be when the purported orders were made and will place the persons affected in the same position as they believed themselves to be in before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions which 1 have mentioned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0)

* Those regulations actually purported to confer jurisdiction on the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia as the court of disputed returns for elections to that Board. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0)

* Earlier this year the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> held that the regulation was invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0)

* Perhaps it is fortunate that it did so because if the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> were to be invoked as a court of disputed returns for elections such as this, the extreme burden of work which it already has would be increased very greatly.

* In fact, it is alarming to contemplate that it would be thought that this Parliament, by a regulation making power of that general character, would intend, or be thought to intend, to confer power on the Executive lo confer such a jurisdiction on the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia to act as a court of disputed returns in relation to a body such as this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0)

* I ask the Minister whether it might be possible for him to inform the Senate - not on this occasion but as soon as convenient - whether there are any other examples in relation to marketing or like boards in the primary production area, of similar purported jurisdiction being conferred upon the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia or upon any other court.

* In the case of Australia Industries Preservation Act 1906, the Act foundered on the question of public interest, with the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and the Privy Council deciding in part in the Coal Vend case on lack of evidence of intent to cause public detriment within the meaning of the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* As I said in the Senate on 7th September, after the historic <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision, the Court held that an enactment in the form of the Industries Preservation Act would have been and was within the scope of the Constitution.

* On this matter,  Mr Connor,  my colleague in the other place, has  Observed  that the portion of the old Trade Practices Act of undoubted constitutional validity - perhaps 1 should not say 'of undoubted constitutional validity' in view of the remarks of one of the learned judges of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>; I might observe that they were of generally undoubted constitutional validity - related to overseas shipping conferences and their agreements with Australian exporters.

* If the Government really wants to use the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision to introduce legislation effectively to bar restrictive practices - to practise what it preaches by laying the groundwork for a free economy spurred by true competition - then the Attorney-General should study the legislation now before the Canadian House of Commons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has cleared the way and the Government can now elect to act in accordance with its expressed principle of free competition, or it can stand by as in the past and allow our community to suffer the unhindered forces of commercial iniquity.

* This Bill, as stated by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood)  and as has been adverted to by other honourable senators, is merely a holding measure made necessary by the application of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the previous Act in which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> discovered constitutional informalities which make the passage of this Bill necessary.

* The Opposition does not suggest that between 7th September when the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> gave its judgment in the concrete pipes case and today that the Government should have been able to produce a satisfactory Bill - to use the words of the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  - extending and strengthening the existing legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* I think it would be agreed among them that the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> was expected by lawyers throughout the community who had had anything to do with constitutional problems over the years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* As I said at the outset, we agree that it has not been possible in the short time since the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> gave its decision for the Government to come up with a properly formulated amendment of the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* Of course this was before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> gave its decision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* In other words the Attorney-General admits that no matter what became of the case before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> the Government was seized of the necessity of putting teeth into this toothless Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* We do not accept that the Government should have been starting from scratch on 3rd September, which is the day on which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia said that the Government had power under the corporations power of the Constitution to do what it formerly believe it did not have the power to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* The short reason for the legislation which is now before the Senate is the fact that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia in the concrete pipes case declared that the preexisting Trade Practices Act was invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* The reasons for the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> so declaring it to be invalid are not germane to the purposes of this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is sufficient to say that the nature of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision made it imperative that there be either wide ranging and comprehensive amendments to that legislation or a completely new Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* The real and essential difference is that this legislation proceeds upon the power which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> declared the Commonwealth Government had as a basis to sustain trade practices legislation, namely, the power to make laws with respect to trading and financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth and with respect to foreign corporations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* I would emphasise that the Bill currently before the Senate is a holding or interim Bill designed simply to overcome the decision given by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> at the beginning of September which created a vacuum insofar as trade practices legislation is concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* That appeal was heard in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in February and March of this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* At about the time that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> gave its decision there was a second case concerning pharmaceutical wholesalers which was currently before the Tribunal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* It has not been able to proceed because of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision and because of the lack of effective substitute legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* I can only reiterate that the Government is committed to strengthening its trade practices legislation, quite apart from having passed through the Parliament as quickly as possible this current Bill which is designed to overcome the recent <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision invalidating the pre-existing Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

*  If what the Attorney-General says is so, my feeling is that we ought to delete the clause from the Bill because the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has said that the Australian Industries Preservation Act is a valid Act, that it is within the scope of the constitutional power and that it is an Act that contained wise provisons that, in later times, seemed to have given some promise of protection to the public against various restrictive practices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* The Attorney-General may elect, instead of proceeding by indictment for an offence against this section, to institute proceedings in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> by way of civil action for the recovery of the pecuniary penalties for the offence; in which case the action shall be tried before a Justice of that Court without a jury.

* Afer all this time we have this certainty which I understand was the guts of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision: Whatever else was justifiable, the Australian Industries Preservation Act was justifiable under the corporations power.

* In my opinion, and the opinion of the SolicitorGeneral as revealed in the statement made on 7th September, it is quite clear that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision is not to be taken as invalidating every section of the trade practices legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* I would suggest that  Senator Murphy's  opinion, in the light of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision and the uncertainty which must prevail as to just how much of !he legislation the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is to be taken as having said has no validity at all, is undesirable in the light of those criteria. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* Because this is a matter which has been in the existing legislation which has prevailed for the last 5 or 6 years and because this Bill is designed to be merely holding or interim legislation to validate that which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> declared invalid, I urge that that is adequate reason to accept this amending provision for the period over which it will operate.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* J thought I had clearly indicated what the Government is doing is simply re-enacting the provisions of the pre-existing trades practices legislation which had been declared invalid either in whole or in part by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, except that some clauses are being altered to take account of the fact that it is corporations as distinct from persons which are now to be charged with offences.

* The short answer to his question is that from the Government's viewpoint there have been no alterations of material substance to the provisions of this legislation other than those alterations which it has been necessary to make to justify the legislation under the corporations power which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> found the Commonwealth had. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* Firstly, as I have reiterated many times, the Government regards this Bill as designed to validate what the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> declared invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is legislation designed to re-enact old provisions to validate legislation, in the light of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* With the re-interpretation of the corporation power, as given by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the concrete pipes case decision, there is now possibly a vast constitutional field available to the Commonwealth Government which has not been explored.

* From talking to some lawyers in the chamber I know that there is a distinction between the House of Lords in England and the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in Australia as to what should be regarded as the criteria upon which exemplary damages are awarded. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0)

* It is the Government's legislation which was introduced in 1965 and which was declared invalid by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> only 2 months ago which is embodied in this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61)

* The Bill which is before the Senate now is designed to replace in a constitutionally valid form the legislation which was declared invalid by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61)

* Basically the reasons for opposing the amendment are, as I reiterate, that this is legislation which the Government has brought forward as speedily as it could bring it forward to repair the vacuum which was created as a result of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision which invalidated the pre-existing Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61)

* There was put into this legislation nothing which was not in the earlier legislation, except the transitional provisions which were necessary and the provisions which brought it under the corporations power of the Commonwealth, a power which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> declared that we had. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61)

* I feel that because this is interim legislation designed to rectify as much as the Parliament can of what the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> recently declared invalid we should proceed on the basis that the Government has initiated; that is to carry through legislation which in fact re-enacts validly the old legislation, and allow these other matters in respect of which there is merit to be considered in the course of review to which the Government is committed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61)

*  The purpose of this Bill is to validate certain decrees which have been granted under the Matrimonial Causes Act in South Australia and New South Wales and certain other orders made by registrars and other court officials which have been placed in jeopardy by recent decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* Therefore it is of vital importance that as far as possible any doubts resulting from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision invalidating certain procedures should be determined forthwith. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* It has been clearly pointed out that this problem arose from two decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia in which it held that the orders of officers of 2 State courts had been invalidly made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* The effect of those decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has been to make invalid a great many of a vast number of orders which have been made over the last 10 years under the Matrimonial Causes Act because jurisdiction was wrongly exercised by certain officers of State courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* As I said, I support the Bill, but I support it because it seems to me that the decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> have not only thrown into doubt but also would render completely null and void - if they ever came up in any court of review - a large number of orders on which people have relied, as the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  said in his second reading speech, in respect of a large number of questions which arise in the administration of the Matrimonial Causes Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* Obviously the fact that a large number of people have been affected as a result of the decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> makes it imperative for this Parliament to validate the orders which have been made over a period of 10 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* It would be impossible to estimate exactly how many of the orders which have been made have been overturned as a result of the decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the cases of Kotsis v. Kotsis and Knight v. Knight referred to by the AttorneyGeneral. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* The decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would not affect them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* Of course, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decided in the cases to which the Attorney-General referred that the registrar, master or official was not actually a part of the court itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* This measure is necessitated by the decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> which have created problems in 2 States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* I stress further that this legislation does not purport to validate decrees which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has questioned or declared invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* It is unquestioned, in my judgment, that the orders and the ancillary relief which is made in those States are in accordance with the judgment of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* I  think the basic point in reply to  Senator Durack  is that the parties to the litigation which occurs before the courts now know as a result of the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> that if they seek to have ancillary relief recorded by a registrar or a master that relief will not be worth the expenditure of money which is required in obtaining it, because the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has indicated that there is no power in the registrars and the masters to accord that relief. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* Naturally it flows from that that the relevant decrees are now made in accordance with the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and in accordance with the Matrimonial Causes Act by the judges who, as the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> said comprise the court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* However, in the many cases to which the Bill will apply, it will provide for the rights of persons to be as it was intended that they should be when the purported orders were made and will place the persons affected in the same position as  they  believe themselves to be in before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions which I have mentioned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0)

* The position (pf judges has come under question due to a decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in which their status as officers of a Federal court came under challenge. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* As  Senator Murphy  said, it is true that the primary purpose of these Bills is to overcome the uncertainty created by the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the case of Capital TV and Appliances Ltd v. Falconer in which it was indicated that courts of the Territories are not Federal courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* Any road accident case involving damages of more than $3,000 can be brought to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges are forced to hear the case and to decide who is right or wrong on the appeal.

* What I am suggesting is that this has been proved beyond doubt, beyond argument, and so the first section of the motion - the suggestion that we should waste the time of 3 <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges to decide whether terrorists organisations exist in Australia - is something which can be laughed out of Court.

* A few of them can destroy a great number of lives and cause a great amount of misery, and to have an inquiry by 3 <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges who would spend a year or 18 months to find out whether there are 200 or 2,000 of them is a luxury that this country cannot afford.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia is not in a position to make declaratory judgments and the States have taken this matter to the Privy Council for an advisory or declaratory opinion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* Senator Cant  said that what could then happen is that if that advisory opinion is given and legislation is enacted in terms of it or in defiance of it a case could be brought in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia as a litigation at law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* It occurs to me that somebody may consider that the Privy Council in banco, instead of referring the matter to a judicial committee comprised of distinguished legal members of the Privy Council in Great Britain, might well refer it to a board of the Privy Council constituted by the judges of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, all of whom are Privy Councillors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

*  Therefore I am suggesting that this may be a device which would enable the matter initially to come before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, the judges of it not sitting as a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> but sitting as a constituted Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* I should also say that section 30l creates a power which the Attorney-General may exercise to deport any person who is declared to be a member of an unlawful organisation by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia or the Supreme Court of a State on an application by the Attorney-General - an application which he may make by use of the averment provisions.

* As  Mr Gorton  said in the debate on this Bill in the other place, nobody suggests that merely by passing this Bill all of this doubt will be dissipated, but at least it will open the matter up for challenge in the place that even  Senator Durack  suggests is the appropriate tribunal to decide these matters, namely, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0)

* But should it go to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> when there is such complete unanimity among the States that this power resides properly in them, has done so since the beginning of Australia as we know it today, has never resided in the Commonwealth in any shape or form and that the Commonwealth has exceeded its powers by endeavouring to legislate in the Commonwealth Parliament for the Commonwealth to have power which the States say that it does not have?

* Similarly, where the present law allows the Commissioner or a taxpayer to appeal to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> from a decision of a board of review involving a question of law, it is proposed that the right of appeal shall lie to a single judge of a State Supreme Court and, ultimately, to the Superior Court.

* As to what was put by  Senator Greenwood,  I would say that it has been firmly stated by the Government that the relief to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia by directing the appeals to the Supreme Courts of the States is intended only as a temporary measure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* Indeed, since the word 'prices' can be construed in such a variety of ways what, in fact, the Government is leading us to is an endless litigation in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, an activity which it states in the second reading speech with regard to the use of corporation power, it deplores.

* I would think that the arguments to the people ought to be addressed to the necessity of enabling this Parliament to have the plain power to cover at least the price of goods, almost certainly the price of land, and perhaps, if the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> agrees, the price of services- I would think of some services- and probably not any power over the other matters referred to. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54)

* In the absence of any decision by that authority which, under the Australian Constitution, has the exclusive right to determine vexing and disputed questions of constitutional law, namely the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, it was very difficult to determine which of the 2 authorities had the appropriate jurisdiction.

* We believe that there should be at least a right of appeal to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> or, putting it more accurately, that the right to go to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to ask the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> whether it will entertain one's appeal should not be prohibited. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-48)

* The effect of our opposition, if acceded to, will be simply that as the position exists at present the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will have a descretion as to whether it will grant leave to appeal and we think that in this area that is sufficient safegard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-48)

* The Opposition's attitude to this would continue the present anomalous situation in which decisions of the Commonwealth Industrial Court on inquiries into amalgamation ballots would be appealable to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> while decisions of the Commonwealth Industrial Court on registration and deregistration of organisations under Part VIII of the Act, which also involve questions of property and assets, and decisions on inquiries into irregularities in union elections under Part IX of the Act would not be appealable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-48)

* The decisions of the Industrial Court in both of these matters are, I think  Senator Greenwood  would agree, concerned mostly with questions of fact; they are not high questions of law which should engage the attention of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-48)

* Our argument is that if this provision were written into the Act to apply to the States as well as to the Territories it could well be that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would say that the provisions now promoted in the present Bill do not provide for just terms and would rule them to be ultra vires.

* In the course of my remarks in the Senate on 30 May I emphasised the policy of the Liberal Party which has been maintained for several years and to which I fully subscribe, namely, that this question is so vital to the maintenance of our federal structure of government and so vital to the State parliaments and the State governments that it presents a question which should not be solved solely by the Australian Parliament or solely by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia.

* Here we have transferred to the new Court the jurisdiction of existing Federal courts and existing Federal jurisdiction now belonging to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and the State Supreme Courts in the one instance vested in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, as I conceive it, by the Constitution, and vested in the other courts by virtue of provisions of the Constitution under Federal laws.

* One acknowledges the overall appellate jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and the problems which that creates in a well settled hierarchy through each of the States, but the problems would be multiplied and the difficulties would be enhanced if we were to have a series of Federal courts as well as the existing State structures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

* The way in which we will achieve that goal is not by setting up 2 structures of courts, which is involved in the current proposal, but by ensuring that the existing structure through the States supreme courts up to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is maintained. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is clear that if the jurisdiction is vested in the Superior Court the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will be relieved to a very great extent of the burden of jurisdiction which it has and it will be able to address itself to the more important aspects of jurisdiction- the cases which have a considerable constitutional content.

The Governor of South Australia in 1907 and reported in 4 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 1497, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> refused to determine whether a senator had been validly appointed under section 15 of the Constitution because this was, amongst other things, a question respecting a vacancy within the meaning of section 47.

* The answers to those questions in the Government's view are clear, but if there is a dispute about them quite obviously, on the view taken by one of my distinguished predecessors as Attorney-General, the correct and only way in which the questions respecting the vacancy can be resolved is by the Senate referring them to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia.

* I would have thought that where a Senator's constitutional right to sit in this chamber is conferred by the Constitution, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is the appropriate body charged by the Constitution with the duties of interpretation, lt would be an unreal situation if this Parliament or any one House of the Parliament were to decide whether or not a senator had the qualifications to remain in this chamber.

* My question is directed to the Attorney-General and refers to an answer which he gave  Senator Greenwood  earlier today in respect of apparently successful intimidation by the Australian Builders Labourers Federation of some building contractors who had taken proceedings in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia.

* Thirdly, it is clearly the means whereby Tasmania was able to escape from the Grants Commission system to which it had been tied for some 41 years and, so far as smokers in Tasmania were concerned, it was the means whereby they did not, following the judgment of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia early this year, have to continue to pay the tax which had been imposed despite the opinion of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* The third thing I mention simply for the sake of completeness but make no comment on is that the arrangement made between the Australian and Tasmanian Governments which has resulted in this legislation enabled the Tasmanian Government to put in mothballs the somewhat ill-fated tobacco tax legislation which caused so much controversy, at least after the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision was given in February or March this year.

* It is a bold step and one in which  Mr Justice  Sweeney may well be right in saying that he believes the Commonwealth has that power, but it is clearly an area in which doubt does exist and will exist until at some time in the future the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is called upon to make some adjudication.

* Probably any advice which any government received as to whether or not the Commonwealth had the power to enact this legislation is advice which would have some element of uncertainty about it until such time as the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> was called upon to adjudicate.

* What I am putting is that the parliament building should relate to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> building and to the other government buildings in a proper way and not in a way which symbolises perhaps the aspirations of Mussolini rather than the aspirations of Gough Whitlam or Bill Snedden.

* So far as the standard of proof of adultery is concerned Briginshaw's case- which perhaps is the most well known- and a number of other subsequent cases laid down that the standard, so the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> determined, was to be that of the ordinary civil jurisdiction but subject to the rule of prudence, that a court should act with caution before finding such a ground established.

* There have been, of course, the efforts- I would regard them as strained attempts- to invoke a Commonwealth power to justify legislation where on the face of it there is no Commonwealth power, but that is a matter of by-passing the Constitution for which ultimately the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia is the guardian.

* I do not know how this problem can be resolved if the Senate is of the opinion that such a court should be established, but I urge the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  to consider the problems with which the Commonwealth Government was faced after the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions of Knight v. Knight and Kotzis v. Kotzis in 1970, because the result of those <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions was that awards of maintenance and awards of custody made by commissioners of Supreme Courts who had been unconstitutionally invested with a jurisdiction which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> declared they did not have, were orders and awards without any valid operation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* If in some way this issue as to whether there is constitutional power can be raised for consideration before it is acted upon- supposing that the clauses go through- I think that a lot of the problems in the future can be resolved, because it would be absolutely disastrous to have a family court established as a Commonwealth court of record in which the decisions made by that court were not sustained by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* It could be some 20, 30 or 50 extra judges of the Commonwealth arena all appointed for life, and if ultimately they should be given some powers which are not judicial powers- this is an aesthetic problem which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has dealt with over the years- then we are creating enormous problems in this country.

* Now that the Authority has been established the Minister says that the Government is unable to get on with the job because of challenges in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia to the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill, which claims sovereignty by the Commonwealth over the continental shelf, and also to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38)

* Is it saying, as it said and did in relation to Ampol Petroleum Ltd, that a State government is not entitled to exercise its legal rights and should not be exercising them, should not be appealing to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and challenging legislation which it believes is not constitutionally valid? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38)

* As I have said, there is every reason why the Government, and the Minister for Minerals and Energy in particular, should agree to the renewal of these permits and then, whatever the outcome of the litigation in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, the respective rights of the Commonwealth Government and the State governments can be adjusted between themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38)

* That is absurd because there is no reason agreements should not be made between the governments to enable this work to be done and the respective rights of the State Government and the Commonwealth Government can then be resolved in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in due course.

* The essential core of the difficulty in the 2 decisions of Knight v. Knight and Kotsis v.

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, within the last 15 years, has had occasion- I think this was the only occasion the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has looked at these powers- to decide, to determine or to say something as to what is the ambit of those powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I think it ought to be recalled that in one of those cases, the State of Victoria v. the Commonwealth, as to the meaning of the Commonwealth's power to make laws with respect to marriage, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> divided four to three on, I think, two or three of the fundamental questions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I only ask the Senate to bear in mind that if 7 judges of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would divide in that proportion on that issue we have some idea of the niceties of interpretation which are involved and the limit which must be imposed upon the Commonwealth power as to marriage.

* In the opinion of the Opposition, if a national park was located within the boundaries of a State- there may well be a Commonwealth national park created in a State- and the Commonwealth Government permitted mining to take place in such a national park, the proper mining laws to apply would be the laws of the State, in the same way as this Parliament applied State laws to Commonwealth places a few years ago when the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> held that State laws did not apply of their own force.

* There is a destruction of confidence and I do not believe that that sort of confidence has been helped in any way by the addition to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> by this Government of  Mr Murphy,  for in doing this has the Government not in fact sent one of its members not only to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> but to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to sit in judgment over problems of legislation which he has virtually fostered and promoted in the Government?

* In this he is supported by Chief Justice  Sir Garfield  Barwick who himself was a distinguished practitioner of the political arts, who went on to high office in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and who has said on more than one occasion that political experience, far from disqualifying a lawyer from the exercise of his judicial functions, adds spice and flavour to his consideration of the problems that come before him.

 - Mr Acting Deputy President, various Acts passed through this Parliament are now residing in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia under challenge by the States of Australia because those Acts were devised by the Commonwealth Government to circumvent what have been the accepted and traditional roles of State Governments in the exercise of their elected responsibilities.

* The other aspect of  Senator Scott's  speech to which I wish to refer- I do not believe that a person of the lustre of ex-Senator Murphy should be permitted to be reviled in this way- was the snide manner in which he attacked the propriety of the appointment of ex-Senator Murphy and his suitability to be appointed to the Bench of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* The present Chief Justice of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, in a tribute to the late  Sir John  Latham who died on the 25 July 1964, referred to the very extensive political career of  Sir John  Latham, who as honourable senators know was appointed directly from Attorney-Generalship of the Commonwealth by the Government of which he was a member to the Chief Justiceship ofthe <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in 1935.

* 1 never had the privilege of appearing against former  Senator Murphy  or with him, but when his career at the Bar is examined it would, I believe be fair to say that few judges who have been appointed to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> during the period of three-quarters of a century have had anything like the breadth of experience at the Bar that former  Senator Murphy  has had.

* It has been said in the course of this debate and by  Mr Lewis,  the New South Wales Premier, that perhaps the action was justified because Lionel Murphy who was appointed from this place to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> was not, as  Mr Lewis  put it, of sufficient juristic ability to be appointed to such an office.

* But the point I simply make, in case  Sir Magnus  is correct, is that this is the first time since the appointment of  Dr Evatt  to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the early 1 930s that a political appointment from this side of Parliament has been the subject of criticism here by honourable senators opposite. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* But if I go further and say that it would be fair in political discussion for people to be anxious as to the purpose of the appointment- that the Attorney-General who promoted certain constitutional claims which are being contested by the States should be translated from the AttorneyGeneralship to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> for the purpose of giving weight in the adjudication o."

* If an appointment to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is for the purpose of giving strength to a judicial position by the participation of an Attorney-General who has already advised on highly important constitutional matters- I do not say that is the position, I previously referred to it by way of explanationif the nominee of a political party was on other than political grounds completely unacceptable to the big majority of the members of the State Houses, if a member of a political party had changed his political allegiance during his membership of the Senate or if he were a sole independent person in the Senate who had no right to have any political succession attributed to him, the practice is ill defined and demands the judgment of those responsible for its application.

* Once we commence the course advocated by  Mr Lewis  and by  Senator Scott  of attempting to discredit people who have been appointed to a court, whether it is the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> or any other court, we undermine that loyalty to those who interpret the laws of this country about which people such as  Senator Wright  have boasted in the past.

 Mr President, I have spent some time in describing the events of the past 3 years because I believe it is important that all honourable senators should be aware of the devices that have been resorted to by some States to avoid the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>-in 1972, in 1973, in 1974-and of the distortions of the Australian Government's proposals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0)

* Our concern is that this Parliament should do everything in its power to complete the process of making the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia Australia's final court of appeal from all Australian courts.

* All I say to the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that he will not be able to find the refuge of another former Minister who did not answer questions; he is not qualified to go to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia.

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia has made it clear on a number of occasions that the ability of the Commonwealth to impose limitations on the States by the use of section 96 is virtually unfettered.

* The State of Victoria challenged the validity of that condition and the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> dismissed the challenge. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* The first is that the Opposition accepts the general principle that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> ought to be the final court of appeal in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* The Opposition's general attitude is that on those matters which are within the federal power and which are matters of federal jurisdiction we should look to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, as a court composed of Australians and existing within Australia, as the final body to which legal matters should be taken. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* Whilst some of those matters do go to the Privy Council from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, most of them ordinarily would go from the State Supreme Courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* As I have suggested, if the Opposition's view is to prevail, we would like to see the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia as the final court of appeal in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* From my researches, I think there have been some 20 appeals in the last four or five years from either the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> or the State Supreme Courts which did not encompass federal matters or matters which were not part of federal jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* Of course, those appeals may go from the decisions of State Supreme Courts or from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, and it is the function of this Bill to deal with the appeals from the Supreme Courts.

* Under the Constitution, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is the sole voice in deteriming whether matters which affect the relations of the State and the Commonwealth inter se may be taken to the Privy Council and it is generally thought that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, in the reasonings which it has used in recent years, would not grant the certificate which would enable that matter to be taken to the Privy Council.

* The then Opposition Party introduced a Bill in 1968 which sought to limit effectively the right of appeal from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the Privy Council and the Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  spoke on that measure in the House of Representatives.

* He said in his second reading speech that if the question of the legislative competence of the Parliament to deal with this matter had to be determined, then it was appropriately a matter to be dealt with by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and the Government was prepared for that to happen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* To say at this stage that we are still not prepared to leave appeals in the hands of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> for reasons which date back to 1900, and in 1900 were foreseen by Deakin as sources of possible problems in the future, is in effect to reflect adversely on that Court as a national institution.

* That leaves the question of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> itself and the view which is put forward that somehow this legislation is an infringement of State rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* The fundamental issue that arises in this debate is simply whether the Opposition is sincere in opposing this Bill but, as I understand it, agreeing to the next Bill which will abolish appeals from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the Privy Council, or whether the Opposition is simply using these 2 pieces of legislation, particularly this one, as a vehicle for a political attack upon the Government.

* If the Bill is constitutionally invalid- in other words, if there has been an invasion of a legal right- then it achieves nothing because one does not doubt that action would be taken by at least the State of Queensland and probably other States to challenge the validity of it in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* I would have thought that if the Opposition was sincere in saying that appeals to the Privy Council ought to be abolished, that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> ought to be the final court of appeal within Australia, then it would have supported this Bill albeit expressing whatever reservations it might have as to its constitutional validity.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* The second manner in which limitation was imposed was the provision in the final paragraph of section 74 that Parliament could make laws limiting the matters in which special leave of appeal from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to  Her  Majesty in Council could be asked pursuant to the exercise of the royal prerogative.

* Since 1942 when the Statute of Westminster was adopted and other developments by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> a situation has been reached where the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is regarded throughout the common law world as one of the most competent courts that any common law system has ever known.

* Fortunately, wiser counsel prevailed when there was a change of government and the Hydro-Electric Commission was persuaded to put its very big file away, pay the damages, read the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s judgment again if it was in doubt as to what the measure of its liability generally was, and get on with the business of generating hydro-electric power.

* But since  Senator Missen  interjects with a somewhat emotive reference to convicted murderers I would answer him by saying that his own Party agrees that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia should be the final court of appeal in all cases, be they murder cases or otherwise, so what is the relevance of the interjection?

* With those guidelines, sincere people desiring to expose but not to expand the true constitutional limits would say: 'When Federation was established we established a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and a federal judiciary', which in relation to the next Bill to be debated by the Senate I shall try to demonstrate that the Government is seeking to confuse and condemn the country by exploitation 'but in the State sphere we maintained the Supreme Courts, the State judiciaries, the State Constitutions, the State powers and the State laws'.

* The point is that we would be trespassing upon the State jurisdiction if we were to put forward a request and consent in the name of the Commonwealth Parliament on a matter which is peculiarly within the State jurisdiction, but it is entirely within our right to put forward a request and consent to abolish an appeal absolutely from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> or the Federal judiciary because that is our responsibility and within our sphere.

* If there is some doubt as to the constitutional power of the Australian Parliament to pass this legislation and if  Senator Greenwood  holds the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in such reverence, why is he so reluctant to allow the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to decide this matter? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0)

* On the one hand, he says that the Opposition agrees that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should be the final court of appeal of Australia and, on the other hand, he wants to leave certain appeals to continue to lie to the Privy Council, despite his disclaimer to that effect.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* It ensured that it would be impossible for appeals to be taken from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the Privy Council in matters which originated in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, which originated in any Federal court or which originated in a territory court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* At the present time when there are appeals from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the Privy Council in matters which have no Federal component there are practical difficulties or anomalies because there can be an issue which involves matters of interpretation of Federal law as well as matters which contain no Federal aspect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* I think on the only occasion in the last 50 years in which a request has been made to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, it declined to give such a certificate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* I think it is generally accepted that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is unlikely to accede to any submission that a certificate be granted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* It is a fine legal point and it may be that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would have to resolve on that question at some stage in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* Firstly, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> was given general jurisdiction to entertain appeals from all Australian courts, irrespective or whether they were [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* State or Federal, and having an appellate jurisdiction in respect of the jurisdiction of the State courts gives the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> ample opportunity to supervise and co-ordinate the development of the law which operates in State courts on State matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Therefore, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia was able to co-ordinate the administration of justice and the State courts were enabled to take their part in each field, both in their original State jurisdiction and in the invested Federal jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* However effectual such provisions may be for ensuring that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> retains an almost exclusive authority to declare the meaning and effect of the Constitution, no one can fail to see that this is done at the expense of rendering almost futile and impossible the practical administration of justice for the purpose of adjusting the real controversies between subject and subject or redressing real grievances which a subject may have against the Crown. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The Bill provides for the establishment of a Superior Court of Australia, a Superior Court of record beneath the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia but exercising with that court the jurisdiction which the Constitution describes as the judicial power of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Section 7 1 of the Constitution recognises that Commonwealth judicial power would be exercised in 3 streams of jurisdiction: Firstly, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia; secondly such other Federal courts as the Parliament created; and thirdly such other courts as it invests with Federal jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Section 75 and 76 of the Constitution went on to provide that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should have or should be capable of being invested by the Parliament with jurisdiction in all the matters which are now set out in clause 19 of the Bill before the Senate as the subject of the original jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Australia.

* It ought to be a corollary of that situation that the Australian Parliament should pass legislation, as this Bill seeks to do, establishing a national judicial system, which  Senator Greenwood  was espousing before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, which would be, of course, beneath the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> but would embrace existing federal judicial institutions which will administer those national laws. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, the Industrial Court and the Bankruptcy Court have, I suggest, been shining examples of what a court should properly be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* We have the Federal Court of Bankruptcy, the Industrial Court, the Family Court- established under the Family Law Bill as this Senate agreed to it; it is not law yet- 6 separate State supreme courts, the supreme courts of the 2 Territories and a host of courts too numerous to count, such as courts of summary jurisdiction which exercise judicial powers under laws passed by the Australian Parliament, and courts which have to be taken, according to a decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, as they are found for the purpose of the exercise by them of Federal jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The courts do not project any national judicial image and the situation is that, except for the Federal courts, namely the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, the Bankruptcy Court and the Industrial Court, we still have a 19th century colonial type basis for determining judicial matters arising under Federal law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Fourthly, it paves the way for the development at a level underneath the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of a body or system of settled law which is peculiarly national in its basic character because such a system of law stems from the interpretation and the application of individual statutes passed by this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* It takes away in some respects jurisdiction from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, a Court which for very many years has been acknowledged to be grossly overburdened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* It gets rid of a multiplicity of State and Territory courts which exist at the moment and it coheres these in one court beneath the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, divided if necessary into 6 divisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The Bill also contains provisions to transfer existing jurisdiction from existing courts- for example, from State Supreme Courts and from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, from the Supreme Courts of the Territories, from the Federal Bankruptcy Court and from the Australian Industrial Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* In other words, in those days the use of the State courts was seen as a means of maintaining a simple court system handling both Federal and State law with the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> acting as the supreme court of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* At the top of the hierarchy is the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> exercising its original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction from State and Commonwealth courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The growth in Federal litigation has been such as to impose an increasing burden on the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The result of that growth has been that, unless the number of <span class="highlight">High Court</span> justices is increased, there is a serious risk that the volume of work in the original jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will inhibit the Court's capacity to fulfil its principal role as an arbiter of constitutional questions and as the nation's ultimate appellate court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Apart from the creation of two Federal courts of limited specialised jurisdiction, namely the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Federal Bankruptcy Court, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in its original jurisdiction and the various State courts exercising Federal jurisdiction have dealt with all matters arising under the Constitution and Federal statutes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* With the full support of the Chief Justice, the Government has decided that it should follow the alternative course, which is available under the Constitution, of investing State Supreme Courts and the Supreme Courts of the mainland Territories with original jurisdiction in certain additional federal matters in respect of which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> now exercises original jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The second consideration is that the establishment of the Superior Court would relieve the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia of the more burdensome aspects of some of its original jurisdiction in matters that can be dealt with appropriately by a court of the kind envisaged. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* That would have the consequence, it is put, of speeding up the work of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and enabling it to concentrate on its essential function in a growing and increasingly complex society as custodian of the Constitution and as the highest appellate court in the land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Insofar as litigants before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia are concerned, it is not a speedy court in dealing with litigation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is not a speedy court in giving judgments after matters have been argued before it, and there can be great inconvenience caused to litigants and great costs incurred as a result of the delays which are apparent in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> at the moment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The fourth of these major reasons of principle to which I have referred is the one mentioned by  Senator Button  namely, the suggestion that there is such a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> backlog of work that this new Court is needed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The State courts, apart from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> which is primarily an appeal court for all the State Supreme Courts, have been dispensers of justice for 70 years since Federation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The reference there is to the Chief Justice of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> -  the Government has decided that it should follow the alternative course, which is available under the Constitution, of investing State Supreme Courts and the Supreme Courts of the mainland Territories with original jurisdiction in certain additional Federal matters in respect of which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> now exercises original jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Back in the time when the proposition of a Superior Court was dear to the hearts of Liberal lawyers- do not forget that it originated from them- the most obviously persuasive reason which they had was that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> was overloaded with the work in its original jurisdiction, that a backlog was developing and that the Court's reputation for promptness and the Court's preoccupation with its great task of interpreting the Constitution was in some way downgraded by its concern with what were thought to be lesser matters- taxation matters, matters involving patents and that sort of thing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* It was thought that to have the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> free of this work would make it a better, less overloaded and more efficient court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* When the Liberal lawyers changed their minds it was because they thought they had come up with a simpler and better solution, and that was to divest the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of much of its lesser work, its original jurisdiction work, especially tax work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* As the letter from  Sir Garfield  Barwick shows, he believed that this was a solution and that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would not be overloaded and therefore there was no need to introduce the concept of a Superior Court.

* But, as introduced by the then  Senator Murphy,  there were other reasons given for the desirability of a superior court than the reason of easing the burden of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia.

* There will have to be a court before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to deal with matters in the way that the Industrial Court does today, quite artificially in the light of its name and function, in regard to matters relating to the Broadcasting and Television Act or the Trade Practices Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* There is a growing body of Federal law in this country and I believe it is desirable that there should be a court throughout the country short of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> which will administer and interpret this law in a uniform manner rather than have it divided by having jurisdiction vested in State courts all over the country coming up with confusing, conflicting and perhaps contradictory interpretations of that law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* What will be done in regard to the continental shelf and the areas that lie below low water mark around the whole of the Australian coastline and what laws will be applied are matters which will undoubtedly exercise great concern and give cause for a great deal of thought and debate once the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia has determined this question of sovereignty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* We find it extraordinary that the Government should be pressing on with this exercise of sovereign power, namely, to establish a mining code for the continental shelf at this time when the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia has not yet determined the issue of sovereignty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* These powers cannot be exercised by the Government until the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> determines that the Commonwealth Government has the sovereignty and the power to exercise the powers that are contained in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* We have even reached the stage where the permits or rights that have been given by previous Federal and State governments under the Petroleum and Submerged Lands Act are now put in doubt because the Minister is taking the attitude that he will not consent to a renewal of these permits until after the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> makes its decision on the claim of sovereignty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* There is no reason in the world why the renewal of permits which people are entitled to have under existing legislation of this Parliament should be delayed in this way because of the claim to sovereignty which has been made and which is the subject of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> hearings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* But what it really means is that members of this Government and the Minister for Minerals and Energy,  Mr Connor,  have it clearly in mind that if the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> upholds the Parliament's claim to sole sovereignty over this area he intends then to abrogate the existing legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* I suggest that this has about it a large measure of presumption, because the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is at this moment the subject of challenge before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* It would appear that it may well have been advisable for the Government in this circumstance, having waited not 3 months but 7 months, to wait yet another two or three months and have in its hands the judgment of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* -Senator Greenwood said in 1973 that 'there are therefore 2 fundamentals which have to be linked with any resolution of this problem: firstly, to know what the limits of authority are'- that is tremendously important for we do not want to have a vacuum in which no one has the responsibility- 'and, secondly, when we do know where the authority lies'- I suggest he would have been referring there to the matter which is now before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>- 'we must have it worked out cooperatively with whatever regime we have in the off-shore waters'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* In a practical sense, forgetting the States' rights issue as an overriding one here- I suggest that the development of Australia's off-shore minerals is of greater importance than the issue of the States' rights at this time after so many years of dissension about that matter have gone by- the subject really to be discussed tonight is whether the Commonwealth is to have the mechanics of making the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill operate if the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should find in its favour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* Hence it was necessary to reach a situation in which the Federal Government would lay claim to all of the off-shore areas of Australia and give the States the opportunity to litigate against the Federal Government through the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and finally have the situation resolved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* With regard to the challenge that is being made in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> at present, the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  a Labor Premier, revealed in the Press on 5 July 1974 that South Australia also would take up the challenge as to where authority lay in the off-shore areas of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* As reported in the South Australian Advertiser',  Mr Dunstan  suggested to the Commonwealth Government that it should invite the States to join in a test case in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> which could be done co-operatively- I emphasise the words 'could be done cooperatively'but the Commonwealth Government had refused the suggestion.

* We assented some months ago to the first part of this Bill, which claimed for the Commonwealth sovereignty over this area in respect of minerals, whether oils or others, and we assented to that for the express purpose of enabling that intensely contentious constitutional question to be decided by the only appropriate tribunal- the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* The whole idea of bringing the legislation on was to ensure that it could be challenged in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and determined and one of the reasons why there has been uncertainty in the industry is that that challenge has not come about and there has not been a final decision on the law relating to this subject.

* In other words, I would invite honourable senators to conclude that  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Murphy has probably the best qualified staff of all the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges and I would hope that this magazine the 'Bulletin' will now have the common decency to call off its vendetta against  His  Honour.

* I have never heard yet one remark either in the trade practices field or in this field that properly acknowledged that it was the Liberal Party Government that brought before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> the review of the old Huddart Parker case and argued for an expansion of the Commonwealth power under the head of the Constitution which deals with foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.

* I am yet to be informed- I will be grateful if anybody informs me as the debate goes on- that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has ever suggested that this Parliament can legislate for the incorporation of companies or the formation of companies, because the language of the power as to domestic companies refers to trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.

* In this case, in the interests of the Parliament and the Australian people, the Government has an obligation to pay the costs which could be incurred by  Senator Webster  before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> because the case will be dealing with the public interest.

* In my opinion this Parliament recognised that there was only one answer to that question years ago when it inserted in the Commonwealth Electoral Act a provision that questions with regard to vacancies occurring in the Senate in circumstances such as this might be referred, by resolution by the Senate, to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> sitting as a court of disputed returns. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Therefore, if I had the advantage of having considered the matter up to the stage at which I have considered it now, I would much prefer that  Senator Webster's  case be considered along with all others by the judicial committee of inquiry and not sent alone to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* I hope that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will see fit to delay consideration of this case- I am not a legal man and it may not be possible for this to happen, but I hope it isumi! [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Therefore the Committee is assessing really whether  Senator Webster's  case should go before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, and the general opinion of this Senate is that he shall be judged. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* I move my amendment to obtain what I believe is a minimum of justice- to make sure that  Senator Webster's  position is quite clear and his case should go to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> but not until the judicial committee has reported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* I propose to support the motion that has been moved for the referral to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns of questions relating to the qualifications of  Senator Webster,  and I also propose to support the amendment which has been moved by  Senator Withers  and which will have the effect of appointing a judicial committee of inquiry to examine the types of circumstance in which other members of Parliament may have contravened provisions of the Constitution and will enable the Senate and the House of Representatives to be informed of any such instances.

* Senator Webster  is a person for whom I have an intense feeling of sympathy at the present time, not just because he will be facing the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and its decision with regard to his qualifications but also because he has been so unjustly singled out as the result of what I regard as a vindictive newspaper campaign that has been seized on politically by some persons within the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* I do not believe that the law would be upheld or that right would be done if that were the case, because we have before us at present a prima facie case which, in my judgment- and I think that every senator must look at it in terms of how he views those facts- warrants consideration either by this chamber or by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> as to whether or not  Senator Webster  has contravened the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* I think that it ought to be said and acknowledged that it was what  Senator Webster  himself told this chamber that provided the basic prima facie case upon which the questions will go before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> because, in the material sent to  Mr President,  there was not the evidence upon which the Senate, properly advised, could have sent a question to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Of course, I use the word evidence' in the broad legal sense, but I think a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judge who received the material contained in the committee's report to  Mr President  would have been sending the material back to the Senate and asking us to give more facts, or the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would have found itself in a very embarrassing situation of virtually having to move, of its own motion, to require before it evidence on which it could make its assessment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Equally, it should be recognised that what he said is the basis upon which this matter goes before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* If as a result of that investigation there appears to be a prima facie case why individuals should have their qualifications as members of either House of this Parliament referred to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, I believe that those questions should be raised, as in this particular case, and those questions should go to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> also. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* But not everyone is as forthcoming, though I hope in due course they will be if a genuine question is raised, as  Senator Webster  was in raising the issues on which a case is now to be taken to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* The tone of that degeneration was set by those senators who, despite the fact there is to be a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> hearing in relation to  Senator Webster  which must resolve certain general issues regarding the meaning of the provisions in the Constitution, and despite the fact that there is to be a judicial inquiry on the wide range as set out in the amendment, bandied names across the chamber in a manner which must have disgusted those who are truly interested in arriving at a resolution of this difficult matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Then, we had from the same senator a dissertation on the law, even though the honourable senator knew that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would soon be determining the law in relation to  Senator Webster  and even though he knew that a full scale judicial committee of inquiry was to be established by agreement of the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* It is not for me to be gratuitous in extending good wishes, but I simply say that I will have no personal pleasure and no party political pleasure if the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should determine that  Senator Webster  has- unwittingly I do not doubtbreached the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* The third alternative was to take advantage of section 203 of the Electoral Act and, by resolution of the Senate, have the question of  Senator Webster  referred to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> as a Court of Disputed Returns. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* In view of the status of this matter, being on the verge of being referred to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and of the appointment of a judicial committee of inquiry with very wide terms of reference, I suggest that that statement was completely inappropriate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* The second point is that despite what has been said this afternoon,  Senator Webster's  case, I understand by resolution of the Senate, is about to be referred to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns, and the public can be confident that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will interpret the provisions of the Constitution, insofar as such interpretation is appropriate for the determination of  Senator Webster's  case, with its normal impartiality. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Two options were open at that stage, either for the Senate to refer the matter to its own committee of disputed returns or to refer it to the Court of Disputed Returns which is the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* It was that reading which convinced me in the final analysis of the need to accept the consensus which exists in the Senate and that this matter should be taken out of the area of disputation amongst honourable senators and sent into an area where the Senate could be informed by the Court  of Disputed  Returns, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, whether there exists the case in which  Senator Webster  had- and I believe unwittinglybreached the constitutional requirements of section 44 and section 45.

* In fairness to  Mr Hills-  I do not know about  Mr Brown-  he was saying that if there had been a register and  Senator Webster  had disclosed his interests in the J. J.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Nevertheless I hope that the vote that will follow will allow this matter to go properly before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and, in the terms of the Opposition's amendment, allow other aspects to go to a judicial committee to ensure that this most important matter receives proper consideration in the proper places.

* But if it is thought that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s jurisdiction to hear appeals is so extensive that it prevents the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> from giving appropriate time to the matters which are before it or which prevents the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> from giving judgments with reasonable dispatch- I know that we in the Senate are waiting with interest for some judgments which have been awaiting delivery for some time- the Parliament has the power to make such exceptions as it desires with regard to the general power of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to hear appeals.

* However, so far from heeding that most salutary advice, we have those provisions copied into this Superior Court Bill giving exactly the same terms for the original jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>- matters arising under a treaty, matters affecting a consul and that sort of nonsense which was appropriate to the American colonies in 1776.

* However effectual such provisions may be for ensuring that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> retains an almost exclusive authority to declare the meaning and effect of the Constitution, no one can fail to see that this is done at the expense of rendering almost futile and impossible the practical administration of justice for the purpose of adjusting the real controversies between subject and subject, or redressing real grievances which a subject may have against the Crown.

* The 2 provisions that we have had incorporated in our Constitution in contradistinction from the United States are that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has been made a court of general appeal not merely from Federal courts, as is the case in the United States, but from both Federal and State courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0)

* That has given our <span class="highlight">High Court</span> sufficient jurisdiction to ensure that in the orderly administration of the law the mistakes that arise in the State sphere as well as the Federal sphere can be corrected on appeal and you can develop a uniformity of doctrine in both the Federal and State law under the guiding hand of one comprehensive general appeal court.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0)

* I can remember that when the matter came up before the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament, of which I was a member, I expressed the opinion that from my knowledge of the attitudes of the judiciary it would be unlikely that any Australian judge would like to be pronouncing on these matters pending a decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* On 19 February the Leader of the Government in the Senate explained to honourable senators that full opportunity was available for the validity of this legislation to be challenged and decided in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> itself- in the court that, as we are all seemingly agreed, should in all respects be Australia's final court of appeal.

* We felt, and it is a general concept to which the Opposition is striving to give expression, that we should give to the Supreme Courts of the States and the Territories as wide and as comprehensive a jurisdiction as can be, that we should limit the courts exercising a Federal jurisdiction to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, and that if there has to be some other court that court should be limited in its role and should not be a court of general usage.

* It has ceased, as a result of an initiative which the Liberal-Country Party took in 1968 with respect to appeals from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the Privy Council, and it is desirable that the appeal from the Supreme Court to the Privy Council should disappear also.

* Although we know the sad history of that exercise-  Mr Connor  may well seek to blame the Opposition, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> or anybody else for the failure of that organisation to get off the ground- the fact is that in the Budget last year when that authority was established by law and before it was struck down by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, the government of the day had not provided it with one cent for the exploration for and the development of crude oil.

* One reason which has been stated is, of course, that there is a challenge to the enabling legislation now before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia and it is customary when such a challenge lies before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> for legislation to be stood aside until the court brings down its decision.

* The case which  Senator Greenwood  has cited of  Mr Justice  Murphy requesting the Chief Justice that he should not sit on one of the earlier cases that came before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> concerning the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, I suggest, is very persuasive evidence of the seriousness with which  Mr Justice  Murphy approaches his duties and the etiquette of the Court.

* The difficulties which arise from sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution stem from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s refusal to enforce those sections and the lack of a definition in the Constitution itself and the absence of an interpretation from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of the meaning of the phrase 'the ordinary annual services of the Government'.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0)

* As I understand what the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers)  has said, when the McKinlay judgment was handed down in December 1975, some 15 months ago, the officers of his Department and the Commonwealth Electoral Office, which is a statutory office, started working on proposed amendments to the legislation to provide for the contingency that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> suggested might exist if a redistribution had not been carried out where one should have been carried out and that was for the holding of an election at large. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38)

* They arise principally out of decisions brought down by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the McKinlay judgment of December 1975 and the McKellar judgment which was handed down by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> this month. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0)

* Again, we say that the 7-year provision is not a measure flowing from either of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judgments but is one which the Government itself has chosen to incorporate in the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0)

* As the Opposition sees it, apart from the rule relating to electorates of 5000 square kilometres or more and apart from the 7-year provision to which I have alluded, the main parts of this long awaited amending legislation now from the December 1975 <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judgment in the McKinlay case and the February 1977 judgment in the McKellar case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0)

* However, so far as the proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act are concerned, the Opposition indicates now that for the reasons I have mentioned- because of the watering down of the 10 per cent principle in clause 7; because of the addition of the 7-year proviso- something that does not flow from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s determination; and also because the legislation in clause 1 1 does not lay down rules for the way in which elections at large shall be conducted- the Opposition will be opposing the second reading of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill.

* Because the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its hearings to date has been allowing- in my opinion, properly allowing- an air of informality in its public hearings on applications for renewal of licences and because there is so much public interest in the matter, can the Minister say whether the Tribunal intends adopting its existing practice or whether the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judgment now means that in all future hearings conducted by the [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0)

* In view of the recent decision in the Sankey case in which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> indicated that certain documents such as Cabinet minutes or communications between heads of departments would not automatically be immune from disclosure to the Court if public interest required it, could you make available to the Senate an opinion as to the impact of this decision on the ability of honourable senators to obtain such documents either by request within this chamber or in Estimates or other committees?

* I have been led to understand- I communicated this understanding to the Minister in the course of the Estimates Committee proceedings- that at least one of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> justices had taken the view that it was inappropriate or wrong for students to be exposed to the argument that takes place in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> before such argument has been shaped up or the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges' opinions have reached final fruition in the form of their final written opinions.

* The fact that the Chief Justice took that particular view of the function of transcript rather suggests that he was also of the view, as I suggested might have been possible, that the provision of this material to law school academics, researchers and students, was bad; that it would give them misconceived ideas of the nature of the judicial process; and that perhaps not only would it make them excessively willing to criticise <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges for what they produced in their final opinions, which these academics are prone enough to do at the moment, but also might it tempt them to start using the text of what fell from judges in the course of argument as further grounds for criticising them.

* The other important point to be made- I do appreciate that honourable senators who have spoken recognised this- is that this measure is the first in what I hope will be a series of Bills to be considered and passed by this Parliament over the next 12 months or more to give effect to the constitutional settlement reached at the last two Premiers conferences regarding the control of the offshore areas of Australia as a result of the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case.

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision, of course, ascribed to the Commonwealth Parliament the full power to legislate in respect of this area but in that decision it did not take away in terms the very considerable powers that the States themselves have, in relation not only to the three-mile limit but also probably even further, provided there is a connection between the off-shore activity and the State whose laws are sought to be applied.

* In essence, the Bill provides for the last stage of the legislative steps which began in 1976 to remove the original jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> vested in it by statute and vest it mainly in the State and Territory Supreme Courts and in the new Federal Court of Australia in part. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Durack)  summarises the purposes to which the Bill is directed: Firstly, it divests the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of original jurisdiction vested in it by statute, other than its original jurisdiction as a court of disputed returns under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* I think it is fair to say that the Australian Labor Party, both in opposition and in government, has always taken the view that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should not be snowed under with original jurisdiction but should be the true pinnacle of the court system in Australia, an appellate court, a constitutional court, and a court which deals with intergovernmental disputes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The Opposition also believes that there should always be an appeal to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> as a right in matters involving the interpretation of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* Essentially we welcome the legislation because it does make the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> the final court of appeal in all Australian matters; that is, it carries that process to a further stage by removing trial by a single judge of numerous matters which have tended to clog up the proceedings of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, which should devote its energies to matters of more importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The objective of the Bill is to make the necessary detailed jurisdictional changes in order to complete the achievement of what the Government describes as a coordinated structure of Federal and State courts in Australia- a system in which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is freed of a good deal of its previous original and appellate jurisdiction in order to be able to concentrate its scarce resources and efforts on appellate matters of major significance; a system in which the new Federal Court is vested with both appellate and original jurisdiction in a variety of matters, including the whole jurisdiction of the previous Bankruptcy and industrial courts and appellate jurisdiction from the Territory Supreme Courts; and thirdly, a system in which the State and Territory Supreme Courts become the primary trial courts in their respective areas with the State courts exercising in addition a more significant role than hitherto in the application of federal law- for example, in tax and industrial property questions and also to some extent in constitutional litigation at first instance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* In particular it is pleasing to see such developments as the final removal of the long-standing anomaly whereby single <span class="highlight">High Court</span> Justices had to spend endless sitting weeks in the trial of highly complex and often legally quite trivial patent and trade mark matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* Another major and very familiar problem area is of course that of family law, where, as is quite well known, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has held in the case of Russell and Russell that there are constitutional inhibitions on the Federal Family Court being able to deal with the full range of matters that can arise in matrimonial and particularly child custody cases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* I believe that the way to achieve this new structure in the long run is to accept that view and to endeavour to persuade the States, State judges and, no doubt, the members of the legal profession that in many areas the appeal process should be with the Federal Court of Australia and ultimately to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The alternative view, which is strongly held, is that all jurisdiction should be vested in the State courts, with them having their own courts of appeal, and ultimately with the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> being the final court of appeal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* I do not think that it is possible to see the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> as being the only court of appeal to ensure uniformity of interpretation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The jurisdiction that is assigned to the Federal Court under the Courts-Martial Appeals Act relates to references of questions of law, which hitherto have been referred to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and to the Federal Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* I think the honourable senator will be aware that in the matter of defining the responsibilities in relation to off-shore waters and the constitutional problem that came up following the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judgment, giving the Commonwealth right over territorial waters, it has been necessary for the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government to enter into discussions relating to this matter.

 Mr President, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia occupies a supremely strategic place, not only in our legal system but also, by virtue of its constitutional adjudication, in our political, our social and our economic system as well. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0)

* Although the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is usually rather less visible than the other arms of government, it is at least as important as the Executive in determining the general shape and character of Australian society, and it is probably more important than this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0)

* In those circumstances, it is important that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should not only be a body in whose individual membership the community has the utmost confidence but also it should be an institution which operates with maximum effectiveness in carrying out the role which the Constitution and the law assign to it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0)

* But both the effectiveness with which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is discharging its functions, and the respect in which the court is held, are matters which have given steadily increasing ground for concern in recent times, so much so that it has now reached the point where in the opinion of the Opposition the matter justifies the attention of an urgency debate in this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0)

* For a time it did appear that  Sir Garfield  aspired not only to the erection of a tabernacle of that kind, from which he could pronounce his and the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s judgments, but also to the purchase of a $400,000 rural mansion in which he could sleep on those decisions.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0)

* But what I think has to be appreciated is that, leaving aside for a moment the question of tourists and visitors, whereas Parliament House already accommodates some 1,500 people and will be expected to accommodate a good many more by the end of the century, and whereas the Parliament House locates not only 188 parliamentarians, the whole apparatus of the Executive heads of government and in effect the whole of the national media, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s job basically as a building is just to accommodate seven judges, the court staff- now 50 and anticipated to rise perhaps to a maximum of 100- and a handful of litigants at any one time.

* Perhaps it is too late to be cavilling about these basic aspects of design of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> building, although I regret that the Parliament did not devote more attention to these matters when they were being resolved in 1972 and 1973.

* In both the executive and legislative branches of government there appear to be not unreasonable elements of checks and balances, but so far as the role of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is concerned, its deliberations and actions appear to be somewhat sacrosanct.

* When that happens, not only is injustice done to the community at large but also a fundamental danger exists in giving a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> such power that it can move in a direction which, philosophically, is contrary to that which is in the best interests of the nation.

* In the first place, as  Senator Tate  has said, what is needed is certainly the rewriting of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to overcome its emasculation by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>- a rewriting that would give the Commissioner of Taxation what it was originally intended that he should be given, namely, a general discretion to override any arrangement of an artificial kind that is wholly inspired by avoidance motives.

* With all respect to  Senator Knight,  who no doubt believes that Australian Capital Territory rates cases are ones that ought to go direct to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, I am glad to see that the percentage of the amount of jurisdiction which is devoted to this very fascinating area of rates is declining.

* 2), which is part of a general reorganisation of the legislation relating to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> aimed essentially at cleaning up the statute book, primarily by disposing of a series of <span class="highlight">High Court</span> Procedure Acts which have been promulgated over the years.

* But I suspect that  Sir Garfield  at least will bear that dimunition of power in this respect with some fortitude, given the aggrandisement of power which has been accomplished in recent years and is now formalised in the further provisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia Bill, to which I will turn in a moment, relating to the financial administration on an independent basis of the affairs of that Court.

* Whilst this Bill is primarily concerned, as I indicated, with repealing previous legislation in this area scattered about the statute book and with consolidating procedural matters in the Judicary Act- a wholly worthwhile enterpriseone of the procedural matters thus consolidated relates to the conduct of jury trials by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* As is reasonably well known, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has construed that part of section 80 as meaning only that the right to jury trial applies where an offence is described in Commonwealth legislation as, in fact, indictable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* Let us turn finally to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia Bill 1979, which is the central Bill in this package of Bills and which certainly is the most substantial in its range and content. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* It contains three main elements, the first of which is a series of administrative provisions associated with the establishment of the seat of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in Canberra. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* I take the occasion to note only that the Opposition certainly shares the view which has been espoused in many quarters that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should continue to travel around the country fairly extensively, even when it is located in the new building in Canberra, especially when matters such as applications for leave to appeal are in issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The second element in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> Bill is the important and new provision it makes for the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to have separate administrative powers with respect to its financial affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The powers now vested specifically in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, which presently are exercised by the Attorney-General 's Department on behalf not of the Court but of the Commonwealth generally, include the power of the Court to enter into contracts, its power to deal in various ways with property, its power to manage buildings and the staff of the Court and also its power, which has raised some rather quizzical eyebrows in various quarters but 1 suppose one can assume that it will be administered sensibly to accept gifts, devices and bequests directed to the courts- one hopes with the best of motives- from various sources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* Associated with that, of course, have been the particular claims of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to enjoy this right of control over its own affairs as being the pinnacle of the Federal judicial system, it being argued to be appropriate to accomplish the transfer in this respect, again, at the time of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s shift to Canberra. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* It is not a luxury that is to be enjoyed- not for some time anyway, if indeed there are any proposals in the pipeline- as I understand it, by the other Federal ^'courts in the system; yet there would appear to be no difference in principle between their position and that of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* So, I suggest that the Government's credibility in advancing separation of powers arguments as a justification for this new arrangement so far as the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is concerned would be enhanced by extending the same honour and courtesy to the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The second point I want to make in this general discussion of the weaknesses of the arguments that have been advanced in favour of separate administration for the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is that the track record of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in recent years in the administration of its own affairs has not really been such as to encourage enormous confidence in its financial or other administrative responsibility. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* With regard to the furnishing of the temple across the road, again there has been very considerable room for concern about the way in which costs have escalated, largely at the instance, it appears, of requests made and generated from within the existing <span class="highlight">High Court</span> organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* I refer in particular to the material derived by  Senator Mcintosh  in the course of the recent round of hearings of Estimates Committee E in relation to the list of proposed furniture for the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* There is reason to believe- as I have had occasion to say in earlier debates on this subject- that the proposed staff structure for the new <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is somewhat erratic by most rational standards, with the proportion of uniformed attendants to researchers and associates being such as might be appropriate in a Roman emperor's bath house but not all that obviously so in the context of a working national institution such as the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The problem is, of course, that to a very large extent, even if the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> continues to be administered from outside, from the Attorney-General's Department, one is very largely in the hands of the judges and the recommendations that they make. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* I hope further that it can be assumed by the Opposition- again I would appreciate the views of the Attorney on this-that the  Clerk  to be appointed to head the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> administration, in fact, will appear before Senate Estimates committees when it comes to the determination and analysis of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s budget. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The final matter dealt with in this legislation, and the final matter on which the Opposition comments, is the very important question of the appointment of <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges and the new clause in the legislation which now appears as clause 6 of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia Bill in the following terms: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* Indeed, it was only with the appointment of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Wilson very recently that Western Australia had its first appointment to the Bench, and it remains true that neither South Australia nor Tasmania has ever had members on the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* We certainly would resist any move that this Government or some future government might be tempted to make, by virtue of its now being incorporated in statutory form, to provide that in the future there will be some kind of rotating arrangement for membership of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>- a kind of judicial Buggins ' turn syndrome. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* Indeed, the points of the Bill which concern us most are those found in clauses 1 7 and 40, which are concerned directly with the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s proposed new powers to control its own finance in certain ways. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* It is relevant to comment that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> appears to have started off very much on the wrong foot, with a reputation for extravagance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* If any additional money is to be spent in improving court facilities in this country, surely it should be spent on these lower courts rather than on the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> which I suggest, because of its stature, prestige and elevation, needs it least.

* While I am on the question of precedent- I think this has a very important bearing- I note that the excuse given for clause 17 is that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> must have power over its own finances and spending because only in that way can it be seen to be truly independent.

* The first is the provision in this Bill which accords a measure of independent administration to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> itself is created by the Constitution, so there is no question of creating any new independent statutory authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* So even though this is the way the financing will proceed there will be control by the Government of course, and ultimate control by the Parliament, over the finance that is made available to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* In order to seek to correct it, the Government felt that it was important that before an appointment was made to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> the Government's attention should be drawn to the widest list of names of suitable lawyers throughout the whole of the nation who could be and ought to be considered for the appointment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* There is no suggestion that there will be any direction to the government or any restrictions on its absolute power and discretion to decide whom it will recommend for appointment to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> shall not, except with the approval of the Minister, enter into a contract under which the Court is to pay or to receive an amount exceeding $ 100,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* That has to be read in conjunction with the provision that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is to be given administrative independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s ability to enter into contracts, of course, will depend upon the money that is made available to it in accordance with the estimates to which I have been referring. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* The object of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s having administrative independence- it is the same privilege as is accorded to independent statutory authorities- is that it does not have to obtain ministerial or departmental approval for the contracts or expenditures it enters into. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* As the sort of contract that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> might enter into would not be in excess of that figure, except in very unusual circumstances, it was thought reasonable to have a lower figure than perhaps would be provided for independent statutory authorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* As I have said, the ability of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> administration to enter into those contracts will, in the end, be dependent upon its obtaining money to satisfy them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* This provision is more to control expenditure of a capital nature that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> may enter into. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-43-0)

* That the Commonwealth does have power to act in this area is, in my submission, as clear as it could be, given that the area has not yet been completely charted by <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions and, to some extent, one does have to rely on analysis and extrapolation of likely trends in those decisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0)

* This is the kind of argument that would have to be fought out in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> were the Commonwealth to be adventurous and courageous enough to legislate unilaterally in this area.

* Senator Evans  said that we should have proceeded at the national level only and imposed national companies and securities legislation by virtue of the powers that, in his view, the Commonwealth Parliament has and leave it to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to resolve any doubts about it.

* On that very day, this Parliament agreed to the passage of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> legislation which virtually gave the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> complete independence as to its financial operations.

* Here we have the situation where yesterday the Senate approved an amount of some $48m being made available to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to give it complete autonomy in its operations but the Executive was telling us that in its opinion the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives should be paid an amount much less than the amount recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal.

* The point to which I wish to draw particular attention is why the Chief Justice- designated or regarded as the chief user- I think that is the term- especially since one would not expect that the present Chief Justice would be around for much longer than the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>; one would certainly hope not, anyway.

* I wish to say something about the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> building that is being constructed across the road and which we find objectionable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-101)

* That distinction has never been accepted by the Australian Parliament, and section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, although undermined by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>- I will come to that in a moment- clearly says that whilst such transactions are legal they are to have no effect against the revenue, and that the Treasury is entitled, despite the transaction, to gather in funds which should be directed properly to it, where the dominant intention in setting up the commercial or trust transaction, whatever it might be, is to avoid legitimate contributions to revenue.

* However, another case is before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and if this overrules the case referred to, that could change the internal marketing arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-125-5)

* If the Commonwealth eschewed all legislation which could conceivably be successfully challenged in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, given that court's notorious record of both political and capricious judgments, the Commonwealth would scarcely legislate at all.
