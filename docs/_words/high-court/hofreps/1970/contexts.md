* This could equally well have meant that the discussions or negotiations - to use the honourable member's words - ought to halt at that point because there had now to be another decision made, a decision which the Commonwealth is seeking in this legislation, the final and irrevocable decision to be made by the whole bench of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> which is the supreme authority to determine who has the sovereignty over these territorial waters.

* Personally I would like to have seen this achieved in harmony and goodwill with the States, with perhaps the Commonwealth paying the expenses of the court case because it is not possible under our Constitution, as I understand it, for there to be any kind of hypothetical judgment or hypothetical case presented for judgment by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, and some kind of actual litigation must proceed.

* The purpose of the group of 5 Bills is to provide the legislative framework for the imposition by the Commonwealth, at the request of the States and for their benefit, of a duty on business receipts so as to achieve the general result that the States do not lose revenue as a consequence of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions invalidating the receipts duty legislation of the States in its application to certain types of receipts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0)

* Accordingly, when the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision in the Hamersley case cast doubt on the constitutional validity of the receipts duty legislation of the States in its application to certain types of receipts, the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  indicated last September that the Commonwealth would see that the States did not lose revenue in 1969-70 in the event that this doubt was confirmed.

* The decisions in those cases were that a large part of the receipt taxes that were being imposed by the States of Victoria and Western Australia were unconstitutional because they were, in the view of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, excise taxes, and the Constitution provides that only the Commonwealth may levy an excise.

* It will look a strange thing in a few months time if a challenge is taken to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and 8 or 10 members of the Liberal Party, who constitute at that stage the Prime Minister's majority, are declared ineligible to sit in this Parliament as holding an office of profit under the Crown.

* But it has to be remembered that, when the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decided in 1930 that conciliation committees were illegal or unconstitutional because they became part of the Arbitration Court as it then was, it pointed out - it was correct in doing so - that a conciliation committee could not exercise judicial powers without being outside the scope of the Constitution.

* I think the House should not speculate too readily on the outcome of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> case, but  if  it is within power it will be because of the skill of my honourable and learned friend that the Parliament and the country can say: 'Well, here it is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-35)

* As there is no provision in the Slates Grants Act 1970 to permit deductions to be made from the grants where a State, or ils authorities, do not pay pay-roll tax, it is necessary to include such a provision in order to meet the possibility that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will uphold the challenge by Victoria and South Australia to the constitutional validity of pay-roll tax in its application to State governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-32)

* In this regard I mention that, in the event of a <span class="highlight">High Court</span>  decision unfavourable to the Commonwealth, and the States, or some of them, deciding not to continue to pay pay-roll tax, the legislation would permit the Government to offset the loss of pay-roll tax revenue to the Commonwealth in future years, by making a deduction to the base grants to which the financial assistance grants formula is applied.

* One can appreciate the need for the grant of some $60m to compensate for the loss of the receipts duties that the States would otherwise have collected in the period from October 1970 to 30th June 1971, but which were made invalid by a decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, which regarded them, insofar as they did not apply to wages and salaries, as a payment in the nature of an excise.

* I do not want to speak at great length on this, but 1 do think that it is important for some protest to be made in this Parliament about what appears to be the extremely high-handed manner in which this Bill has been framed, whereby the Commonwealth has reserved for itself virtually the right to take money out of the Victorian Treasury if the Victorian Government is able to prove in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> that the payroll tax which the Commonwealth has been levying against it is not constitutional.

* But what I cannot understand is the attitude of the Opposition in coming into this place today - Tuesday - to castigate and to criticise the Government for its lack of activity when it was only, after all, last Friday that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> handed down its judgment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-1)

* It is not simply a matter of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> handing down last Friday a momentous decision, which indicates a wide extent of Commonwealth power and the Opposition then coming to the Parliament on the following Tuesday to castigate the Government for not immediately having on the statute books legislation which might in the long run be worth while but which is not there now.

* Despite all the brilliant constitutional lawyers who suggested that it was not competent for the Commonwealth to legislate, apparently the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the recent trade practices decision indicated that the coast was quite clear for any government in Australia to legislate in this field and I hope at last that that field will be entered fairly quickly and we will not again have to await protracted examination before some sort of skeleton attempt is made to grapple with it.

* Of course, when  Mr Callaghan  wrote that in October 1970 we did not have the decision in the Rocla pipes case and it seems that as a result of that case it has been affirmed by the majority of judges in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> that what the Australian Labor Party had asserted for a good many years was necessary, but which was always howled down as unconstitutional, was in fact constitutional all the time.

* One would hope that, although it is not in the nature of an appeal as I read the Bill, it would obviate some of the risk taken in trying to go to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, which as I said before, is a long way away. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0)

* The action of the New South Wales Premier and his Cabinet in deciding to appoint to the Senate a person belonging either to the Liberal Party or the Country Party as a result of the vacancy caused by the appointment of the Honourable Lionel Murphy to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is something that flouts the convention which has grown up and has been applied almost universally since Federation and certainly has been applied universally since the adoption of proportional representation.

* I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that section 73 of our Constitution provides:   no exception or regulation prescribed by the Parliament shall prevent the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> from hearing and determining any appeal from the Supreme Court of a State in any matter in which at the establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal lies from such Supreme  Court  to the Queen in Council.

* It is hardly to be expected that States, at this stage, would be prepared to give this Government that final sanctuary through the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>; that is, that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would be the ultimate determinant of the laws of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* But with regard to the second point, it is certainly true that it is necessary at a time when there is a suspicion by the States as to the intentions of this Government in the application and creation of laws as well as in the constitution of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, that they should not be prepared to accept that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> should be the ultimate determinant of any of the laws that they might pass and that they should forgo the right of ultimate appeal to the Privy Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* Having said that, I am asserting my own point of view, which is that I believe it necessary that we progressively accept that there has been a change since this Constitution was adopted and that, today, there is justification in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> being the ultimate body to determine all matters pertaining to the legal system within this country and the interpretation of laws which might be passed by any government within Australia.

* In other words, having said that we believe the time has come when there should be an ultimate acceptance of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> by all the governments and parliaments of this country, we do not believe it appropriate for this Government to act, as it has acted in so many other areas, in complete disregard of the rights and privileges of the States.

* We have heard speakers from both sides of the House argue with tremendous force just how good is the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia and just what a contribution to the common law world the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia has made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* For that reason the Opposition supports the abolition of appeals from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia to the Privy Council by the method chosen by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* I say that, because in his speech the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  sought to roll up into one speech the justification of the Government for limiting matters in which leave to appeal to the Privy Council may be sought, that is, by abolishing altogether appeals to the Privy Council either from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia or from State Supreme Courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* He used the same argument in respect of the abolition of appeals from both those jurisdictions, speaking, as the honourable member for Bennolong  (Mr Howard)  has mentioned, about the flowering of the Common Law, how its growth may be stunted in Australia if these appeals to the Privy Council are maintained, speaking in high terms of the eminence of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Justice in the Common Law jurisdictions of the world.

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> truly has a proud tradition in the Common Law world and it is a tradition which has been in no way detracted from by the fact that appeals may be taken to the Privy Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* Yet we have the Constitution of Australia, which again he is so fond of using as authority for his stand on the constitutional proposition that he so often propounds before this Parliament, giving to this Parliament supremacy in respect of appeals to the Privy Council from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>; but it deliberately does not give that same supremacy in respect of appeals to the Privy Council from the State Supreme Courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* The importance of the distinction is this: Whilst the Government can simply and quickly turn to the authority of section 74 of the Constitution and the supremacy of Parliament in respect of appeals from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the Privy Council, it must seek some other legal authority in order to give effect to its view that there should not be such a thing as an appeal from a State Supreme Court directly to the Privy Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* That is why we in the Opposition who believe that in the end the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia should be at the pinnacle of the judicial systems of Australia will support the Bill now before the House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* We see that each purpose must be achieved by moving along a different path, and if the Government would move along the correct path in respect of the Bill to abolish appeals from the State courts to the Privy Council then the Bill would have a much better chance of acceptance by this Opposition, in the same way as the Government is receiving acceptance for its proposal to limit appeals from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* -In this adjournment debate I should like to raise the matter of the propriety of the appointment of the Honourable  Mr Justice  Murphy, as he now is, to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, and also the matter of the propriety of the decision by the Government of New South Wales in respect of the appointment of a person to fill the casual vacancy created by the elevation of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Murphy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* Let us take first the appointment of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Murphy to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* Appointments of justices to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> are by the GovernorGeneral of Australia in Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* I cast no opinion as to the propriety of the appointment of  His  Honour to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* So, whatever the private or political opinions of members of the Opposition or the people of Australia as to the elevation of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Murphy to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, whatever might be the private or political opinions as to what the Government of New South Wales proposes to do, no criticism can be made of either of those acts in terms of the Constitution of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* If ever there were a reason for our State governments to have absolutely no trust in the Labor Government's appointment to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, that is conveyed in the message which the Prime Minister made loud and clear in that year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0)

 Mr Bland believes that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> provides some safeguards for our liberties; I doubt it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0)

* In the limited time left I say that  Mr Tom  Lewis has every reason to be frightened at the appointment to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of ex-Senator Murphy, now  Mr Justice  Murphy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0)

* But it is pertinent to observe, in the light of that remark, that the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, by which the Government seeks to assert and establish its sovereignty over the off-shore areas of this nation, is presently the subject of litigation before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* Of course, the situation is that, if the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> holds that this Parliament did not have the power to pass that legislation, then this Parliament has no authority in terms of sovereign rights, to quote the Minister's phrase, over the off-shore area in relation to mining activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* So it is quite a presumption on the part of the Government, when the Seas and Submerged Lands Act is to be dealt with by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> within the next 2 months, [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* It really can only expect that the Opposition will oppose it, if for no other reason than that it would be a presumption on the part of the Parliament to pass this legislation when such action might be negated by the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* I would fully expect that the Senate would take the same attitude- it has every right to take that attitude- and say to the Government: 'If you have waited 7 months since these Bills were last before the Parliament and rejected, why can you not wait another two or three months until the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is brought down? ' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* In explanation of the drastic drop-off in exploration offshore, the Minister says these days that nothing can be done to accelerate exploration until the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> brings down its decision on the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* So whatever might be the design or desire of the present Government to exercise what it sees to be the sovereign rights of this Parliament over off-shore areas, there are very good practical reasons why it should approach the exercise of those sovereign rights, if it is shown by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to have them, in a co-operative way rather than in a destructive way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* We continue to think that this legislation is illconsidered and badly timed, more particularly because presently before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is a case involving the Seas and Submerged Lands Act.

* Until the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> makes its determination I think the Minister ought to withdraw this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* If the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> upholds the powers of the national Parliament in this field he can reintroduce the Bill in a way which is likely to receive acceptance by not only this Parliament but also by the parliaments of all the States of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0)

* If, however, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> finds that this legislation is invalid and unconstitutional, why not pass it and let the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> pass judgment upon it at the same time as the other legislation?

* The Australian Industrial Court and the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia would not have regard to what the Minister says but would have regard to what the Act says and the Bill currently before us does not say what the Minister said by way of an interjection in answer to the honourable member for Wannon.

* As a result of that activity the Attorney-General of the day was given adequate opportunity to refer that apparent blatant contempt of court to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> so that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> could take official cognisance of it and act upon it.

* I can tell the honourable gentleman, in passing, that that judge of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> probably has more chance of becoming the Chief Justice of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia than the honourable member has of becoming Prime Minister of Australia, although the honourable member is working at that.

* There can be no doubt of the constitutional propriety of the actions of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  through his Government, and of the advice which his Government gave to the Governor-General to have the then Attorney-General appointed to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* However, when I listened to the Prime Minister's address to the nation on Sunday, 16 February 1975, I was concerned to hear the context in which he referred to the appointment in the past by the Australian Government of 5 other Australian Attorneys-General to the position of judge, four of them to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia and one, Chief Judge Spicer, to the Industrial Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* I think it is important to point out to the House that there is a clear distinction between the position of judges of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia who have formerly been the Attorney-General of the Australian Government and appointment to the high judicial offices within the English judicial system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* That is an important distinction because the Constitution of Australia gives to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> the authority to declare legislation constitutionally invalid by reason of the fact that the legislation does not fall within any of the expressed powers given by. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* That immediately throws into stark difference the position of Attorneys-General of the Australian Government appointed to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia because those judges are then in a position required by their oath to make a judgment on the validity of laws passed by this Parliament and introduced by the Government of which they were a Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* How much more necessary is it then for members of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> who have previously been members of a government which has been instrumental in the passing of a law to be so very careful in the stand that they take in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> when they are called upon to judge the constitutional validity of that law.

* I notice that in an article in today's edition of the Sydney 'Sun'  Sir Mellis  Napier, former Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia and former Chief Justice of the South Australian Supreme Court, is quoted as saying that the appointment of a judge to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> ought not to be treated as a matter of political expediency but as a question in which the whole of Australia had a keen and vital interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* There can be no doubt that the Prime Minister in advising the Governor-General pursuant to the Constitution to appoint the then  Senator Murphy  to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> took every political advantage at his command and given to him by the Constitution of Australia to appoint his own AttorneyGeneral to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> at a time when the Prime Minister knew that a number of pieces of legislation introduced by his Government and passed by this Parliament, either in the ordinary way of passing legislation or after a joint sitting of the 2 Houses, are subject to litigation in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> on the grounds that they are constitutionally invalid as not falling within the powers of the Commonwealth under the Constitution.

* Let him not speak in terms of violence to democracy when he does not present in proper context his own arguments in justification of his own action because, as I have said, in appointing the then  Senator Murphy  to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> the Prime Minister undoubtedly took every political advantage at his command, acting as he did with strict constitutional propriety.

* When this proposal is seen in this light- even if we disregard for immediate purposes all other equally important questions such as necessity, cost and the complexity this court would create within our judicial system, if we focus solely on the aspect of the massive re-direction of jurisdiction into this Court, together with the denial of the right of appeal to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>- it must become clear that the result of this Bill will not be to streamline our judicial process, increase its efficiency or even to clarify it.

* If it is argued that we should have the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> as the final court of appeal to establish law because of our independent status, is there anybody in this House who would support the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  and the Government by saying that the way in which to do it is to establish our lack of independence; to establish clearly by an act of this House and the Senate that we do not have the full constitutional independence?

* I conclude by emphasising the point that to end all appeals with the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> would not in any way submit us to any risk of a deterioration of our legal standards in Australia, for I say without any disrespect intended whatever to the learned judges who form the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council none of them can claim greater wisdom in the law, either collectively or individually, than we can claim for our own <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0)

* One would have thought that in this day and age, in 1975, Australians of whatever shade of political hue or feeling would have agreed on one thing at least, namely, that Australia is a nation which today recognises, as far as its legal system is concerned, that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> is and should be the ultimate court of appeal from all Australian courts, whether those courts be part of the Federal system or whether they be part of the State systems.

* The Australian Government takes the view that it wants to go to the limit of constitutional power because it has to change the absurd situation whereby an appellant in a State system of courts- in the New South Wales Supreme Court or the Victorian Supreme Court or the South Australian Supreme Court or the Western Australian Supreme Court or the Tasmanian Supreme Court or the Queensland Supreme Court- can bypass the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and go to the Privy Council, thus setting up 2 different competing lines of authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0)

* Yet the Australian Government, in trying to give effect to its policies, to see the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia as the single and only ultimate court of appeal, once again is met with arguments from the Opposition to the effect that it does not really oppose the Bill but there must be some other way in which the Government should try to do this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0)

* This is one further example of the attitude of the Opposition when its members rise in this place to say that it is right and proper- that is the effect of their words if not the meaning of their wordsthat Australians should not use their own <span class="highlight">High Court</span> but in six different ways from six different parts- called States- of Australia should be able to appeal to a supreme judicial body in another country that increasingly is a foreign country to Australia notwithstanding its very close historic ties with Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0)

* In 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978, and for all we know in the year 2000 if the Opposition has its way and continues to control the Senate, Australians will still be required to appeal from the Supreme Court of, say, Western Australia not to our own <span class="highlight">High Court</span> but to the Privy Council in England. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0)

* Honourable members will know that at the time this Bill was introduced there was a companion Bill to abolish the final right of appeal from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia to the Privy Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0)

* We supported that Bill and our support was consistent with our attitude that the final court of appeal should be the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0)

* So I emphasise again that the Opposition is in no way opposed to a situation in which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia rightly becomes the final court of appeal on all matters arising in the Commonwealth of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0)

* Let me go back some years to what the former Chief Justice of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia, the late  Sir Owen  Dixon, said in the railway case of 1953. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* The reason the Government has inserted that provision, if I may say so, is that it was well aware of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision in the case of Whybrow and Co. in 1910 when it was held that persons or organisations not parties to a particular dispute have no right of audience at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Government seeks to overcome that finding of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> by wording the Act in such a way that there is no right inherent in the Act but there is a right of application in the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* I believe that the very first time the Commission grants the Minister leave to intervene the Australian Council of Trade Unions might very well lodge an action in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to challenge the validity of the Commission so acting. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* So the Government is escaping a legal challenge on the grounds that the Parliament will be doing something invalid, and it is seeking to obtain the same invalid act by allowing the Commission to do that which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will not allow the Parliament to do by legislation.

* One lesson that we learn from the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision- indeed we suspected when we were debating the Family Law Bill last year that we might learn it- is that in Australia under our Constitution the Federal Parliament does not have power to legislate with respect to matters relating to the family and that therefore under our constitutional set-up the only type of court that can deal with all matters relating to the family is a family court set up under State law which is invested with the necessary State and Federal jurisdiction.

* The principal changes the Bill would make to that scheme are as follows: The relatively low limit of the money value defining appeals as of right from State Supreme Courts to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, $3,000, which was fixed in 1955 and the right of appeal from lower State courts exercising federal jurisdiction mean that matters of lesser significance can come before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* The general effect of the changes will be to provide some relief to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, by restricting the appeals that come to it as of right and enabling it to remit to other courts for trial matters commenced in the original jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1)

* It went completely against the judicial convention that the Australian <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has no advisory role, and certainly no single justice of the Court should tender advice on a matter which may come before the Court.

* The fact of the matter is that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judgment on the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, which was deferred until 17 December 1 975, clearly established once and for all that the Australian Government has sovereignty over the seabed, superjacent waters and air space. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-24-0)

* The Attorney-General also would realise that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions of 1916 and 1921 are based on the principle that the executive powers of the Commonwealth can be exercised only by Commonwealth Ministers and by officers of the Commonwealth and that under no circumstances can a State Minister of the Crown, such as a State Minister for Mines, be considered an officer of the Commonwealth, as he answers to a State parliament- and the same applies to a State public servant.

* What the shadow Attorney-General was saying, in fact, was that not only ought a government to ignore the Parliament but also that it ought to control circumstances so that Executive Council would give no protection ultimately to the people of Australia; that it also would be run over and that presumably the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> action, which would clearly declare the decision of the Government to be unlawful, would also be ignored.

* The effect of these arrangements will be that, subject to the provision for appeals by special leave to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> from the full court of the new Court, the Federal Court of Australia will be the authoritative exponent of the law in the special federal matters and will thus ensure uniformity of interpretation of the law in important areas such as income tax and industrial property.

* In the course of looking at the legalities of the situation it is interesting to look at how our own <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, in dealing with cases which I think related more to Papua New Guinea, has been in a bit of a dilemma in the past as to whether its powers were virtually under section 122 of the Constitution or what is known as the external affairs power, which is placitum (xxix) of section 51.

* I do not wish to repeat what was said by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech; suffice it to say that the substantive clauses of the Bill vest jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals and applications that come within the scope of the agreement in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and make appropriate provisions for relevant procedural matters.

* Now that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has declared for the second time that certain sections of the Representation Act are null and void and that the original sections of the Constitution still apply, and since there are no proposed referendums to alter those sections, what steps has the Government taken to determine the number of members in this House to which each State is entitled and to undertake the redistribution of electorates which the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has declared must take place in the lifetime of this Parliament?

* Nevertheless from the introduction of proportional representation in 1949 until the vacancy caused by  Senator Murphy's  appointment to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in 1975 the practice was observed of filling casual vacancies by the appointment of a person belonging to the same political party as the former senator.

* As long ago as 1918, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> held in Alexander's case that section 72 requires that every justice of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and every justice of any other court created by the Commonwealth Parliament, and indeed every magistrate so appointed, shall, subject to the power of removal contained in that section, be appointed for life.

* The Committee considered that the Constitution itself should provide that <span class="highlight">High Court</span> justices be required to retire on reaching the age of 70 years and that Parliament should be empowered to fix the maximum retirement ages of other Federal judges subject to a constitutional limit of 70 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* In observing this distinction the amendment contained in this BUI recognises the special position of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> as the Federal Supreme Court created by the Constitution and vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and, one hopes, soon with ultimate appellate power in this country.

* The second safeguard is that, even though under the proposal this Parliament wil be authorised to fix the specific retiring age forjudges of federal courts other than the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, a judge once appointed will have a constitutionally guaranteed tenure to the retiring age that was applicable to his office at the time of his appointment.

* <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and Federal judges hold office for life because of a decision given in 1918 that because at the time our Constitution was drawn up judges in England held office for life, therefore, judges mentioned in our Constitution, which is a British Act of Parliament, held office for life.

* I have mentioned the desirability of amending the Constitution to permit this Parliament to set a retirement age for future federal judges, other than the justices of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, and to make constitutional provision for retirement at 70 years of age for justices of that court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* Of course many people over that age can still have full possession of their mental faculties, but the incredible record of longevity of members of the Federal judiciary read out by the Leader of the Opposition indicates that normally on retirement members of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and other Federal courts have been considerably older than people in other professions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* We should realise first that no change is to be effected on any present incumbent of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> or other Federal courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* It is necessary that we recognise that neither this Bill nor the acceptance of this question at a referendum will in any way affect the incumbency or term of office of those who are currently Federal court judges or <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* Nor will it affect the appointment and continuation in office of any present incumbent of Federal courts or the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> subsequently appointed to a more senior position either by transfer from a Federal court to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> or elevation from the Federal courts or the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the position of Chief Justice.

* They are not immune from the geriatric process of mental decay and accordingly it follows that there must be some intelligent appraisal by the Australian people of whether we think sixty, sixty-five or seventy should be the age at which the man or the lady- it could well be a lady on the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>- should retire. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* But I am anxious to make the point that perhaps this could have been done by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> itself by having another look at Alexander's case which seemed to have the doubtful distinction of having been decided by people who in fact had written the Constitution themselves and that often involves some personal motive in respect of what they think would be best for themselves.

* Lastly, the referendum proposal will contemporise the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia by legislating for an earner retirement of judges, which must in turn lead to the appointment of younger judges. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* We will again give the people the opportunity to face up to their constitutional responsibilities rather than do what governments and people of this country in fact have done since federation, that is, to rely upon the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> for any meaningful constitutional change by way of <span class="highlight">High Court</span> interpretation rather than changing the Constitution by way of referendum.

* Any citizen of the Northern Territory- and certainly the AttorneyGeneral could appeal to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> against any decision of this Parliament regarding conditions that it may attach to Northern Territory statehood which the Northern Territory itself believed was arguable against in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>.

* I think it is very appropriate that this BUI should come forward now particularly in view of the recent <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision which stated in a ruling about the relationship between the number of electors and the number of seats in the House of Representatives that the people in the Territories could not be regarded as people of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* If a review is made of the earlier <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision in relation to the eligibility of senators from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory sitting in this place one wonders whether, in view of the retirement of  Mr Justice  McTiernan and of the appointment of another judge, the result will be a definite 'no' meaning that those senators are not entitled to sit in this place.

* The Constitution, particularly as now emphasised by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision, virtually made, despite what other people have said here, a one vote one value proposition in that the population of the Commonwealththat is, a count of the heads of people- is to be the yardstick upon which we determine the quota for the States.

* Accordingly one can really argue from the point of view of electoral justice that as the principle of one vote one value applied in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> determination of fixing the quota for States, would not the logical situation be that within the State itself, as far as is practicable, we should as near as possible have equal quotas?

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> said that the quotas for States are not fair for all time, that distributions have to be carried out wherever possible and as soon as practicable, certainly every 3 years.

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in 2 cases- McKinlay's case at the end of 1975 and McKellar's case this month- has made it plain that there were some objectionable features in the Representation Act.

* It is not only not required by the Constitution or by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, it in fact is seeking, as far as a government dares now in the light of these 2 recent <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judgments on the Representation Act, to bypass or defer a proper form of distribution.

* It is true that in this Bill we can no longer saythe <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has made it plain that we cannot say- that there should be at the end of a full Parliament an election for a number of divisions which is not sanctioned by the provisions of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* This Bill is introduced as a result of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision whereby the number of members in the House of Representatives will be tied to the number of Senate representatives in the 6 States as compared with the suggestion that the representatives for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory should be included. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision means that whilst we have 60 senators representing the 6 States then the House of Representatives shall have a minimum number of 120 members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* However, I doubt that the third one would work in view of the fact that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> does not recognise the 300 000 people who live in the Territories as people of Australia.

* I would support very strongly any move to utilise part of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> as an electoral commission to have exclusive responsibility for the setting of boundaries and for the determining, in line with our Constitution, such matters as are covered in the very clause which we are debating now, that is, clause 7, relating to the above and below quota variation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* In our case I imagine we would be talking about the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, or a section of it, as an appropriate body to hear appeals and finally to determine the boundaries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* That amendment has been included to protect the Parliament from the situation which has arisen as a result of the recent <span class="highlight">High Court</span> findings which may otherwise have had the effect of a redistribution being carried out every 3 or 4 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* The recent <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judgment was in fact a blow at the Government, which rushed through legislation in 1965 after it had lost control of the Senate but before the new senators took office, to provide what has now been declared to be an illegal means of setting the number of members or determining the quotas for members in this House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* I would not wish it to be thought by the public at large that these Bills come into the Parliament today only because of decisions taken by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in McKinlay's case and in McKellar's case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* In the 2 <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions to which I have referred, and after consideration of section 24 of the Constitution, the Court expressed the view that the words 'whenever necessary' which appear in section 24 mean that the number of members to be chosen in the several States must be determined in time for each ordinary general election and that such election must be held in accordance with the entitlements so determined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* The effect of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decision embodied in this legislation is that in the twelth month of every Parliament- I put it in simple terms because I believe that if it is [nit in simple terms it is more likely that the pubic will accept this as a genuine measure or series of measures rather than as a politican exercisethe Chief Australian Electoral Officer, on the basis of the latest available population statistics, which he has to obtain from the Australian Statistician, will make a determination as to the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for each State and forward that determination to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* The first reason in my view is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and subsidiary legislation to take account of the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in the 2 constitutional cases decided in December and early this month. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* While the Government may justly claim a responsibility to legislate to cover the former, neither the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>'s decisions nor the Government's election rhetoric justify the latter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* The 2 decisions of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> that have necessitated the amendments now proposed by the Government both concern the interpretation of section 24 of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* In the first of the two recently decided cases, Western Australia against the Commonwealth- it is known as McKinlay's case and was decided in December in 1975- the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> held that section 24 of the Constitution intended the calculations used for ascertaining the number of members must be made before each general election and therefore held that this required the latest statistics of the Commonwealth to be used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* If writs were written for an election of the House of Representatives before the Governor-General proclaimed divisions under proposed section 24, the election would have commenced as defined in 1905 by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and it would seem that the new divisions could not be used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* I think that a standing commission on the matter should be established, although I am not sure whether it should consist of <span class="highlight">High Court</span> judges or be conducted under the present system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* The Representation Act, the Census and Statistics Act and the Act that we are debating are a trilogy which will implement the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* That decision has made it quite clear that there is a need to amend the existing relevant legislation in order to bring it into accord with the Constitution as it was interpreted in the 2 <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* For instance, although the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> said that it was enough just to rely on section 24 of the Constitution, there is a need to do something about section 10 of the Representation Act and the amending legislation in fact does that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has recently re-endorsed that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* Of course, as was known in the past, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> wisely said that this Parliament ought to control the economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28)

* Part of it, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act, was subsequently found by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to be invalid, and no provision was made for consultation with the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* But before the matter could go to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to be considered the Minister abrogated the authority of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> by deciding that the licence would not be issued.

* I am informed that, initially, after the Family Law Act commenced on 5 January 1976, the Attorney-General deferred the preparation of regulations under this section pending the determination of the challenge in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> early last year to the validity of major provisions of the Family Law Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-3)

* I am further informed that late last year, following the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision, the Attorney-General approved the drafting of regulations under section 1 1 1 subject to consultations with my Department and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-3)

* It is anticipated that the hearing of this matter will come before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> early in May in the Melbourne sittings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-9-0)

* I have received representations from honourable members from both Territories to have in effect the right to be represented and some sort of legal aid in relation to their representation before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-9-0)

* Whether they really need it of course is another matter because of the fact that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will have before it the Commonwealth Solicitor-General putting arguments in favour of the validity of the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-9-0)

* In relation to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, which has the highest possible reputation in Australia and overseas, while quite clearly a retiring age of 70 years will mean that some people of great capacity who would be able to continue to serve that Court with excellence would be denied the possibility of doing so, I think it will be admitted by most honourable gentlemen and by the wider public outside that there are also some people whose powers do not continue forever as they get older. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-21-0)

* There have been a very large number of justices of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> who have continued until the age of 80 years and beyond. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-21-0)

* I do not think there is any cause or need to mention names but I believe that there is a general view that, if something is lost because somebody of great excellence retires at the age of 70, by and large when the capacities of all people are considered and when one considers what happens to people beyond the normal retiring age which is accepted in nearly every walk of life, the reputation of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will be enhanced by the acceptance of this referendum proposal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-21-0)

* I pointed out that an appeal had been made to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia by MetroWest Broadcasters Limited, a principal of which is a  Mr Harold  Cottee of Cottee fame. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0)

* I also pointed out that the decision of the Minister was made on 10 March 1977 and that a hearing was to be commenced by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia on 15 March 1977. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0)

* The hearing of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> was due to commence on 15 March 1977 but the Minister deliberately made this decision to abrogate and to short circuit the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia for fear that there may have been a decision in favour of Prospect Broadcasters Pty Ltd. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0)

* One must ask oneself why the Minister is ignoring the interests of the north-western suburbs of Sydney and why he is deliberately abrogating and trying to circumvent the decision of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0)

* This view was expressed in 1944 in an opinion of the then Attorney-General and former <span class="highlight">High Court</span> Justice,  Dr Evatt,  when he stated that section 25 (2)- a section under which Permanent Heads derive their responsibilitiesmust be read subject to fundamental and overriding principles that the constitutional head of a department of the executive government of the Commonwealth is the Minister of State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* While arguments can be adduced that there have been notable people who have performed admirably beyond that age, by and large I think it is the view of this Parliament that the status of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> will, over time, be enhanced by the retiring age. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0)

* -The Attorney-General will remember that last week he indicated he would consider representations from the seven parliamentary representatives for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory for the granting of assistance to appear before the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of Australia on behalf of the interests of the people of those Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-13-0)

* -My question, which is directed to the Attorney-General, is partially supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Canberra and refers to the case initiated in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> by Queensland and Western Australia concerning the representation of the Territories in the Senate and the House of Representatives and the assurance of the Prime Minister that the Northern Territory is shortly destined for Statehood. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-15-0)

* Again, within a short space of daysnamely on 1 6 March- Western Australia also decided to institute proceedings in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to the effect that the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are not entitled to have representation in this House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* One must wonder immediately how it is that State governments of that type and political domination can instigate litigation in the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> which will at least jeopardise the right of people of the Territories having representation in both Houses of the national Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* Again I would like to place before the House some interesting comments by no less a person than the Chief Justice of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* It raises this serious question of democracy in Australia: Does the Chief Justice really think now that he will be able to get a majority of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to overturn the relatively recent earlier decision in the case of The State of Western Australia v. The Commonwealth of Australia that there could be senatorial representation for the Territories? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* If the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> in May were to determine that within the meaning of the Constitution, representation for the Territories does not mean representation in the full sense of the word but means perhaps only the right for a territorial representative to appear in a Parliament and speak when invited, and does not mean the right to take part in any debate and certainly not the right to vote, territorial representatives would be mere mummies from the point of view of effective representation of the Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* We are now aware of the fact that there will be two <span class="highlight">High Court</span> challenges by the 2 States I have mentioned, namely Western Australia and Queensland, to deny the people of the Territories the right to any representation in this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* Irrespective of what happens on 2 1 May, the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> may decide in May that the people of the Territories have no right to vote for a representative in the House of Representatives and therefore exclude them from the right to vote in future referendums. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* If the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> determines early in May or at some later date- possibly after 2 1 May- that they have no such right, this referendum will be null and void and of no effect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* As I say, irrespective of what happens on 21 May, in other words if there was a resounding majority decision to give people in the Territories their basic rights, a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision made before or after that date will remove those rights by interpretation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* The <span class="highlight">High Court</span> itself should not be engaging in this encouragement for further challenges. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* I believe in the democratic system and, therefore, I believe in the role of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> and in the right of people to test propositions before that Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* But I agree with the honourable member for KingsfordSmith that it is very dangerous for a Chief Justice of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to be inviting challenges to decisions of that Court only a short time after they have been made.

* As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has said, if a <span class="highlight">High Court</span> challenge is successful it will negate the referendum provisions, which in itself would be a nonsense.

* Has the honourable gentleman seen a report that a law lecturer in Western Australia is of the opinion that the complement of the New South Wales and South Australian members to this House was unconstitutionally elected at the general election and that he is proposing to ask the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> to declare those members' election void and to order new elections in those States in elections to be held at large?

* Unfortunately, from various <span class="highlight">High Court</span> cases I have read in recent times the same attitude seems to have crept into the Australian <span class="highlight">High Court</span> of treating as ingenious these acts and devices which are practised by people to force someone else to pay their share of the tax.

* There is a lot of talk about the Curran case but I suggest that we ought to devote a little time to the recent <span class="highlight">High Court</span> case of Slutzkin v. the Federal Commissioner of Taxation which means now that there is practically no barrier to the well-advised tax dodger against dividend stripping.

* I want to make it quite plain that when one reads the judgment it is quite clear that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> was faced with a legal question and on the law as it stood in the interpretation of difficult and complex legislation it produced what it considered to be the logical result even though it is a result that as a matter of policy one could disagree with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21)

* So it is clear that the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> derived logically its conclusion and  Mr Justice  Gibbs in the politest judicial words said that the result was surprising. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21)

* Section 260, on the face of it, seems to say that all forms of tax avoidance, such as that dealt with in clause 9 and the other clauses of the Bill, are void as against the Commissioner, but in effect the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> has rendered section 260 virtually useless in prohibiting tax avoidance.

* I understand it has still to determine finally its policy with respect to trading within Australia, but I have little doubt that the product of the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> decision is that wheat growers throughout Australia will receive significantly more for wheat traded domestically than has been the case in the last few years, and this is something that I think every wheat grower generally would welcome.

* I do not have time to go into this area in any detail, but I think it is well known by all honourable members that section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is one that has been written down by the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> over the last decade or so to the point of near meaninglessness. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0)

* In that case the <span class="highlight">High Court</span> held that the word 'outgoing' in section 51(1) has been- I want to emphasise these words- interpreted as covering outgoings to which the taxpayer is definitively committed in the year of income although there has been no actual disbursement.

* While the case is on appeal to the <span class="highlight">High Court</span>, I believe in respect of both parties, the matter will remain in this situation of uncertainty and the final decision will determine the ability of taxpayers to take advantage of a situation some 12 to 18 months in arrears.
