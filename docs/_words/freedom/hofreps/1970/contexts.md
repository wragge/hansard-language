* In the White Paper lip service is paid to the ideal of continuing patient care or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in paragraphs 4.19 and 4.22 by the implication that patients will be able to have continuity of attendance by their own doctor, that is, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice.
