* If doctors wish to see a situation in which there is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and in which there is an opportunity for competition, it is their duty to ensure that they comply with the annual determination which would be fixed by an independent tribunal comprising representatives of government, consumers and the medical profession, under the chairmanship of an independent person.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0)

* In short they were the lower quality of medical care which is envisaged under Labor's proposals, the greatly increased cost to the majority of the taxpayers, the loss of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice so far as the individual is concerned, the jeopardy to the whole future of religious, private and country hospitals and, what is more important to many of us, the first stage of Labor's proposals for the nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia.

* Because we believe that the proposal of the socialist Minister will mean a downgrading of the medical service and a consequent lowering of the standards of health care to Australian families, because it will destroy the existing scheme, increase the total cost to the Government and for the majority of taxpayers, because it will mean the end of private and religious hospitals, and, above all because it will mean the end of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of patients with respect to their doctor or hospital, we totally reject the Bill.

* The preamble of that Act said that, under the prevailing economic conditions developed with the aid of Government authority for owners of property to organise in the corporate and other forms of ownership or association, the individual unorganised worker was commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract to promote his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of labour and thereby obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment.

* The reason for that, as was given over many decades, was that such a system as is embraced within this Bill ran counter to the concept of the rule of law, and the argument went that the rule of law implied the absence of wide discretionary powers in the Government affecting the personal liberty, the private property rights and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of contract of individuals.

* To prevent an individual from carrying on any particular activity involves some restriction on his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> particularly if it affects his livelihood, but the curtailment of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> involved in the prohibition of what can at most be an intermittent activity of recruiting mercenaries in the United Kingdom is a minor one and does not require a high degree of danger to the public interest in order to justify it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0)

* On the other hand although, as will later appear, we do not think there are any means by which it would be practicable to prevent a United Kingdom citizen from volunteering while he is abroad to serve as a mercenary and from leaving the United Kingdom to do so, we should regard any attempt to impose such a prohibition upon him by law as involving a deprivation of his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to do as he will which would require to be justified by a much more compelling reason of public policy than the prohibition of active recruiting of mercenaries within the United Kingdom.

* To prevent a United Kingdom citizen from accepting service as a mercenary abroad is a restriction upon his personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which could only be justified on grounds of public interest.

* I make the point that the industrial relations policies which are being debated before the Senate today are a sort of legislation which has within it the protection of the individual the protection of groups of individuals, the right of people to find, not necessarily as individuals, some sort of representation in the courts, and the right of people to object to matters which they believe are not relevant to their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as members of a free society.

* When I hear people say that the introduction of a pass system of the sort that has been referred to is an infringement of our <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, or the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of our electors who have lawful occasion to come here, the most parallel precedent in history that I can bring to mind is the debates in the House of Commons when Canning and  Sir Robert  Peel were introducing legislation for the establishment of a civilian police force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0)

* So I say, prima facie, a system of security is overdue and, from what I can see, so far from infringing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> it strengthens the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of members who have lawful occasion to come and go. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0)

* This derives from a number of factors: Firstly, its importance to public information, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and expression is crucial. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0)

* Therein lies our basic approach as regards broadcasting planning and policy implementation, expressed in the following philosophic terms: That government involvement in Australian broadcasting must be directed to ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise in all forms of communication available to Australian society, particularly radio and television, and that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is best served by diversity of structures and outlets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0)

* However, we also believe that facilitation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise in broadcasting must be consistent with the onus upon government to make the necessary planning and administrative provisions, to obviate the risk of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise for one sector, or group, being indulged at the expense of others, or of the system as a whole.

* The point is that in his speech there was no indication of any attempt in this legislation to cut across the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association of any trade union, whereas the core of this legislation is to provide an opportunity for particular workers and individual members of a trade union to express their views in a free way.

* In this regard, we recommend that section 6 (3) of the Ombudsman Act, which would preclude him from investigating a matter which is also the subject of an appeal to the Tribunal, should not apply in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information matters.

* In his role of monitoring the legislation, the Ombudsman should be empowered to advise agencies, at their request, as to their obligations under the legislation and, in his reports to Parliament, to offer suggestions for improvement and reform in relation to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information in general.

* I draw attention to our various recommendations on access, on manuals and directories and the regular updating of them, on the availability of the internal law of agencies, on the need for informative <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information handbooks explaining rights and procedures, on language requirements and ready availability. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Government's initiative in the field of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information is most welcome and is a worthwhile commencement point. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* Incidentally, his contribution to making <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information a public issue in this country can hardly be underestimated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* The findings could be summarised succinctly but, I think, accurately as follows: Firstly, despite what has been said by so many Government spokesmen, the Westminster system does not justify extensive limitations on the scope of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information; secondly, many claims about the resource implications of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation have been undoubtedly greatly exaggerated, and the Public Service can and should be able to cope with legislation much less narrow than that which has so far been proposed; thirdly, the present <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill allows much too much information to escape the net entirely, containing as it does too many unnecessarily restrictive exceptions and exemptions; fourthly, the Bill provides insufficient safeguards against administrative, procedural and financial obstruction of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information requests- too many obstructive powers rest with agencies; fifthly, the Bill does not impose sufficiently clear and precise guidelines for agencies to publish directories, indexes, manuals and guides on the operation of the legislation; and sixthly, the present review and appeal procedures are both too cumbersome and too limited. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* Secondly, it has recommended a reduction in the capacity of the bureaucracy to put procedural and financial obstacles in the way of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information applicants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* But we do not want any old <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill enacted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* We certainly do not want a Bill like the present one which is pregnant with the danger of doing more to undermine <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information than to advance it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* I should like to say, with regard to the problem of security documents, a subject on which I have some professional experience, that our recommendations will not only improve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, but also markedly improve the national security arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* It is for the Parliament, not for the Executive, and certainly not for the Public Service to decide the details of a Bill such as the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Government <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill was clearly the product of the bureaucracy, with some minor Ministerial input. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* I feel quite sure that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information would go a long way in this community to taking away that tremendous cynicism about government and about parliamentarians of which we hear so much. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* We have also been informed that on the advice of his Department the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  will want to have the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill and this report referred to an interdepartmental committee, which would mean, firstly, that it would be buried completely. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* Secondly, it would mean that it would be watered down at the hands of the same Public Service Departments which have made submissions to the Committee opposing greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information- because of not enough staff, because it was not practical or was unworkable- but who were in fact unable to justify in a rational way just what it was that would make it more difficult for them, where the extra workload would come in. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* I think it will be seen that one of the most valuable aspects of the report, apart from its recommendations about the Australian piece of legislation, will be found in the bibliography which is an integral part of this report identifying the areas of debate and discussion, and identifying the sources pf debate and discussion on the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information.

* The report reads: 4.62 We value the Westminster system of government; we do not seek to change it; nor do we believe effective <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation would change it A great deal of the talk about the Westminster system and how it would be altered by <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation has been obscured and misleading.

* I have no hesitation in saying that the witnesses who appeared before our Committee- the permanent heads of the Department- of the Treasury and of the Department of Prime, Minister and Cabinet- appeared without qualification to be most opposed to the effective operation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation.

* I believe that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information is capable of making an important change in the way in which Australian government operates and in restoring something that has been substantially lost in the last couple of years in Australia and in other Westminster systems: That the control of legislation and of the shape of government lies in the hands of Parliament and that the purpose for which that control is exercised is the better government of the people of the country concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* I suggest that the exposure of that so-called confidential information, in particular the remarks of the Queensland Minister, indicate that, until the Commonwealth Government stops soft pedalling with Queensland, there will never be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for anybody there who is less than white.

* Our relationship with neighbouring countries like Indonesia is, of course, important, but the sensitivities of the Indonesian Government should not be considered more important than the lives, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, the self-determination and the health of the men, women and children of East Timor who have been sorely abused for centuries by a neglectful colonial power, who have been abandoned in the wake of a revolutionary change in that colonial power and who were then taken over by a neighbour obsessed with unreal fears that a hostile power could develop amongst the 600,000-odd people on the edge of its own country of 1 30 million people.

* East Timor presents a typical tragedy of modern times; of people who initially were denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and development by their colonial power, then were denied self-determination by a neighbour and then, despite the willingness of others to help and despite the good will which existed, perverse national pride prevented the Indonesians admitting until now that a problem existed.

* Here a confusion, I must say, entered the remarks of both  Senator Missen  and  Senator Puplick  because, in saying that a judicially enforceable Bill of rights is perhaps not the immediate answer to Australia's situation, I agree only in a sense of that expression, namely, that the judges should not be given as their basic raw material a Bill of rights which is drafted so widely, so ambiguously, as to allow them the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of interpretation which was the concern of both  Senator Missen  and  Senator Puplick.

* It is a fact, as has been pointed out by honourable senators, that most violations of human rights- perhaps up to 95 per cent, according to documents circulated by  Senator Missen-  occur within State jurisdictions and have to do with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, the rights that one has when a criminal investigation is carried out by the police, and that type of situation.

* What it does is to rely on an understanding of the law, which was perhaps excusable even at the time of the drafting of this Bill and of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill; namely, an understanding as to the almost sacrosanct character of the conclusive certificate issued by the Executive such as would prevent an independent, impartial body such as a court or commission from inquiring into the reasons which might have led the Executive to decide to withhold a particular document from that court or commission.

* In the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information report recently tabled by the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in relation to clauses which were of similar structure in that they simply relied on conclusive certificates of the Executive to prevent documents being obtained under the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, it was decided by the Committee that nevertheless reasons for non-disclosure need to be given to an impartial tribunal so that it can decide on the relative strength of the claims made by the Executive for non-disclosure as against, in that case, the need for a full disclosure in accordance with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information philosophy; in other words, let an independent tribunal judge where the public interest lies.
