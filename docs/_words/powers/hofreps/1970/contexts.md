 - Mr Speaker, the failure of the Federal Government's monetary and fiscal policies to halt the insidious increase in costs and prices throughout the nation demands that the Government be given constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to intervene directly in Australian industry for the regulation of prices of basic industrial commodities such as steel, aluminium, oil, petrol and chemicals.

* The outline of the authority drawn up by the Advisory Committee and which was endorsed by the Industry and put to the Government clearly did not envisage a single body with monopoly <span class="highlight">powers</span> to buy and sell the whole Australian wool clip, which the term 'single' implies.

* However, the regulation-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> would extend no further than necessary for purposes of this kind: if the Commonwealth wished to make other changes - for example, if it wished to increase the penalties for assault or other crimes committed in Commonwealth places - it would have to do so by separate legislation.

* Honourable members will see that these 2 Bills and the Bill we are now considering contain a vast extension of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> and that if the High Court upholds the constitutional validity of the Bills and there is any inconsistency between the Commonwealth and State laws then, to the extent of that inconsistency, the Commonwealth laws will prevail.

* This is the relevance of the external affairs <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the need to decide it, because if by chance the Premier of Queensland is right he cannot, because his State possesses no international personality, argue his own case and he cannot adopt the simplistic method of saying: T invite an independent New Guinea to agree with me to draw a median line'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0)

* In the Australian federal system, it is I think, clear that off-shore control is exercisable in accordance with the constitutional division of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and States, the territorial sea being for this purpose treated as part of the territory of the State concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0)

* Accordingly, the control of the oil resources of the sea-bed beneath the territorial sea would normally appear to fall wholly within State authority, subject of course to such Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> as those with respect to defence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0)

* Section 88 empowers the Governor-General, where an Act, regulation, etc., confers <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties on the holder of an office, to direct an officer to exercise or perform those <span class="highlight">powers</span> or duties during a vacancy in the office or when the office-holder is absent or unavailable to perform the duties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-22-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-28)

* Proposed new section 19, as contained in the Bill, would give Trans-Australia Airlines full and unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> to operate as a road transport commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-28)

* As advised in my earlier letter, the Commission believes that to be capable of effective competition within the Government's policy, it is necessary for the Australian National Airlines Act 1945-72 to be amended so as to remove legal doubt as to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to engage in activities closely related to airline operation, and to have normal commercial <span class="highlight">powers</span> to invest moneys not immediately required. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-28)

* The Commission believes the extension of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be an integral part of the Government's revised policy and the necessary legislative amendments should be introduced at the same time as the Airlines Agreements are extended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-28)

* It is the intention of this Government, therefore, to introduce in the first sittings of the new Parliament a Bill amending the Australian National Airlines Act so that there is no question about TransAustralia Airlines having the <span class="highlight">powers</span> enabling it to engage in activities closely related to airline operation and to give effect to the Government's decisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation went on to say that the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the previous Government was contemplating giving to TransAustralia Airlines were, firstly, in aviation engineering work for outside organisations; secondly, in Commonwealth contracts; thirdly, in the establishment and operation of hotels and other kinds of accommodation; fourthly, in the establishment and operation of road transport services; fifthly, iri the acquisition of shareholdings; sixthly, in the field of aerial work and charter operations; and, seventhly, in operations in Papua New Guinea after independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The amendment of the Australian National Airlines Act to widen TAA's <span class="highlight">powers</span> is one matter concerning which this Government is in complete agreement with the previous Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* It therefore has no hesitation in bringing forward this Bill, which is designed to give TAA the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> mentioned so that it will be in a fair and equitable position compared with Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in respect of its operations under the 2-airline policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* In addition, the Commonwealth, in the airlines agreements, understood that it would not exercise any of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under or by virtue of an Act to discriminate against the private enterprise airline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* It states that the Treasurer may lend to TAA out of moneys appropriated by Parliament any amount which the Minister certifies is in his opinion necessary for the exercise of TAA's <span class="highlight">powers</span> - I stress the following words - at such rates and on such conditions as he determines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The provisions of the Bill propose to vest TAA with wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to engage in intrastate transport; that is, air and land, aerial services - that is, general aviation - hotels and other establishments or enterprises providing accommodation, recreation and entertainment or other services or facilities as incidental to the primary functions of the Commission as set out in section 19 (1) (a). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* It is invoked on a basis which is clearly intended to give TAA the widest possible <span class="highlight">powers</span> to operate hotels, accommodation services, etc., permissible under the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* It has the clear and blatant intent of making a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> by State governments totally unnecessary and also, if it withstands legal challenge, will make it quite unnecessary for the Commonwealth to hold a transport referendum as contemplated by the Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* Proposed section 19c not only invokes the Commonwealth's incidental <span class="highlight">powers</span> but in paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) also purports to vest TAA with unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> to engage in intrastate transport both on air and land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* to the extent that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are capable of being conferred on the Commission in the exercise of the power of the Parliament to make laws under paragraph (xx.) [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The whole nub of the argument is this: Do the Minister and the  chairman  of TAA seek the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are given to them in this Bill? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* So if these men mean what they say -and one accepts that they do -they have no need to seek the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> sought in this Bill which could allow some future Labor government to go very much further than these 2 gentlemen propose going. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The excesses of power in all fields proposed for TAA in this Bill are streets ahead of the moderate proposals and incidental <span class="highlight">powers</span> proposed by the previous Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* As can be seen from clause 13 of the Bill, the Commission's financial capacity comes in 2 ways: From the power to borrow moneys necessary for the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, with the Treasurer's approval, and from money appropriated by the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The significant addition to the principal Act are the words 'the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* Again, under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given in this Bill, TAA could decide that it is necessary to commence the manufacture of tyres and spare parts and even to control its own petrol and fuel outlets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* But it is quite obvious that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> now given to the Commission, or to TAA as it is better known, will turn it into a bureaucratic or socialistic monster of a size unequalled in Australia's history. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* As I said earlier, these <span class="highlight">powers</span> extend to the area of 'hotels or other establishments or enterprises providing accommodation, recreation, entertainment or other services or facilities'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* Again, this clause is given further unknown power and unmeasured thrust by calling into use in the Bill the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by paragraph (xx) of section 51 of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* Also where <span class="highlight">powers</span> had been referred by a State, TAA's rights were clearly understood. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The ramifications and <span class="highlight">powers</span> included in this Bill are much wider than those required to give TAA the right to join in industries closely related to its airline service.

* I received a telegram pointing out that there was some concern in the minds of the people conducting Flag Motor Inns, and that they were protesting against the terms of the proposed Australian National Airlines Bill giving Trans-Australia Airlines unfair <span class="highlight">powers</span> of competition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The financial resources of the Commission are not defined, but when the financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> are examined the resources are seen to be immense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Bill will extend all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to the full extent of the corporations power, as yet undefined by the courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* Not only does the Bill extend TAA's functions into new areas but also, with the financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> it has under this legislation, the Commission - not TAA - will be able to monopolise every industry in which it engages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* The <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are provided will be enhanced by strong financial backing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0)

* But the Government has found a convenient way to do it here; that is, by giving some innocent, efficient body like TAA these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and then providing it with unlimited finance so that it can buy out its competitors and become a monopoly in a commercial manner.

* He obstinately and deceptively refused to answer the question of whether or not the Commonwealth would use <span class="highlight">powers</span> over incomes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* But in a debate of this magnitude and importance the Government is arguing that it does not believe the sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Opposition claims should be exercised - whether they should be exercised permanently or temporarily is a matter for argument - can be exercised separately.

* There is not the slightest doubt that the Prime Minister is using inflation, and the hurt it is causing to the Australian people, to support his plans to acquire greater <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control and regulate the economy, industry and business. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* The longer inflation is allowed to run without any real effort to check it - arid that is exactly what is happening - the more convinced I am that this inaction is part of the Government's deliberate strategy of building up an atmosphere of fear about inflation so that the people will give the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it wants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* It is the Prime Minister's and the Government's failure to see this, and their general economic incompetence, that has led us into this whole inflationary mess, and which is going to get us deeper and deeper into an economic quagmire if the people are persuaded to give the Prime Minister the <span class="highlight">powers</span> he wants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* How could I support this proposal knowing as I do, that there is simply no need for the Commonwealth to take these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to itself; knowing that the States are ready and willing - despite what the Prime Minister might say - to co-operate with the Federal Government in a comprehensive attack on inflation - the only kind of attack^ as I said before, that has any chance of succeeding? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* I put this to the House: The Government, with the limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it has, has taken more steps in the 8 to 9 months it has been in power to do something about the inflationary situation - a defenceless situation it inherited from the previous Government - than the previous Government ever did.

* The Prime Minister made it clear in his second reading speech that, if the Australian Parliament, is given the power and authority to regulate and to control prices, his Government will use such <span class="highlight">powers</span> responsibly and selectively as one of the elements in an anti-inflationary strategy.

* Finally, there is an easier and quicker method to achieve the same objective than by holding a referendum, and that is for the Commonwealth to persuade the important States to refer to the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span>, under section 51 of the Constitution, over prices and incomes for a limited period, say for 6 months or 1 year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* In big power terms and stating the position baldly, I expect the next few years to be marked by a fairly stable equilibrium between the 3 major nuclear <span class="highlight">powers</span> - the United States of America, the Soviet Union and China.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0)

* It is positively harmful because the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be granted to the AIDC will cause a massive diversion of funds away from existing private institutions, increase the control of industry by a statutory corporation, and provide a vehicle for the socialisation of Australian industry.

* I believe today with the amendments and the extended <span class="highlight">powers</span> now being given to AIDC it will mean undue bureaucratic involvement in the private sector of the community and is a major tool towards socialisation of many of the productive areas of the Australian economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0)

* But to make certain that the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the organisation are enlarged in a comprehensive way, the Bill provides for other changes to the Act which I shall now mention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0)

* Spattered about in the 2 Bills and the Act - the Australian Industries Development Corporation Bill and Act and the National Investment Fund Bill - are clauses and sections dealing with the capital of the AIDC, its borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and command over finance.

* As honourable members will see, the legislation proposes to give the AIDC and its associated organisation enormous financial power and an extensive range of functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> - far too many to be entrusted to a government, let alone a statutory corporation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0)

* In those big televised meetings between Nixon, Brezhnev, Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai in Moscow and Peking, the leaders of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> agreed to support universal principles, which would lead to a new order in the world, but when they all gathered around here at the United Nations on the East River during the latest Middle East crisis, they sang a different tune.

* In circumstances like this, with its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to obtain funds and with its command over resources being so great, again the whole concept of the original Bill and of the AIDC has been changed.

* If the object of this legislation is to use the Australian Industry Development Corporation to secure Australian ownership and control, it is fair to ask the Minister to say when he responds in this debate why he seeks an extension of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the ambit of the AIDC relating to the fields of transportation and the distribution of goods. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27)

* It has come from AIDC because the Corporation has found, in the conduct of its operations under the old Act investing in companies, that the time has arrived when, in order properly to safeguard and look after its interests it has faced problems which required it to have these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27)

* If the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition were in the same position as  Sir Alan  Westerman, if he were conducting a business of his own and if he found that in the interest of his business he needed to be able to do these things, he also would seek an extension of his <span class="highlight">powers</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27)

* In the early 1940s, proposals were submitted to the Australian Agricultural Council which, as honourable members know, is a ministerial body, for the establishment of an institute of agricultural economics, with wider functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> than the present Bureau of Agricultural Economics, and wim complete freedom independently to carry out and publish the results of research into a whole range of matters affecting primary industry.

* I believe that if we reflect on some of the occurrences in recent years relating to the Tariff Board and consider the added <span class="highlight">powers</span> that this Commission will have and the added scope it will cover we will see very clearly the departure from this House of real government in terms of a situation where a government in office is answerable to the nation.

* For that reason I believe that the Minister might well consider the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra as being a worthwhile assurance that the  Chairman  does not exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we would consider excessive in relation to the normal functions of the  Chairman  of a body of this character. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* Also, we moved amendments which we believed would make sure - this is what I think the Minister for Education has said he wants to do, even if sometimes there is an appearance to the contrary - that due note was taken of the wishes, intentions and plans of other education authorities and which would remove the perhaps somewhat arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we believed the Bill in its initial form gave to the Commonwealth Minister to do precisely what he liked. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0)

* The other amendment that I would also hope would be acceptable - and I would ask the Minister to look at it closely - refers to sub-clauses (1), (2) and (3) of clause IS which really do give to the Minister for Education quite arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0)

* However closely those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are followed on the advice of his Department, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in terms of the legislation are arbitrary, without appeal, and stand for a time scale of 2 years.

* If we do not wish to confuse rural reconstruction with rural credit but simply look at this situation with a view to restructuring and adjusting industry and providing the option to move into other occupations or other areas of primary industry, the long term rural credit where the Government or other <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be have more control in the context of as fully viable a rural sector as possible is more of an answer.

* This was done despite the trenchant criticism of the Senate Select Committee which drew attention to the enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would be vested in a Minister in circumstances such as this and which were the antithesis of the way in which both the Senate Committee and the Opposition felt legislation should be put, implemented and carried out later by regulation.

* The Labor Party, having noted the reluctance of colonial <span class="highlight">powers</span> to give up their colonies - a reluctance which led to wars of national liberation, subversion and bloodshed - was determined that the distresing lessons of history should not be repeated in Australia's colony - Papua New Guinea.

* The recent creation of the portfolio of Defence and Foreign Relations in Papua New Guinea and the appointment to it of a Papua New Guinean Minister,  Mr Albert  Maori Kiki, is proper recognition of the fact that Australia will retain reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> in foreign affairs and defence only until Papua New Guinea is fully independent.

* The present Government's muddled approach to the whole question of an incomes-prices policy has been apparent from the start - a series of fiascos with the Federal Caucus and a series of debates in this House in which the Government avoided in each case attempting to outline any form of policy to justify seeking <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes.

* We challenge the Government, in this debate, to demonstrate its overall program to deal with inflation; how <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes would be incorporated into that program; that prices and incomes <span class="highlight">powers</span> would have only a temporary role within that program; that discrimination against particular groups in the community and action against individual freedom of choice are not its intention; and to state that it will take a responsible lead by reducing the extravagant growth in public sector spending.

* All we are wanting is at least to give this central Goverment - the only Government that can exercise such <span class="highlight">powers</span> - the ability to produce in Australia what the Constitutional Review Committee said some time ago was an integrated economic policy.

* It was opposed in Caucus by just short of a majority of members of the Caucus, so that there is a significant body of opinion within the Government that does not accept that there should be an incomes policy, and it is of no use for either the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to come in here and advocate that they need more <span class="highlight">powers</span>.

* I hope that in the course of this debate we have been able to rouse the Australian people to the dangers of voting Yes, Yes to give these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a Government that does nothing but think in terms of vague slogans while it is after the people's vote and then puts the boot in afterwards.

* Of course we have to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the central Government, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are possessed by every other country, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which can be used when the Tribunal reports on the steel industry, the paper industry or even on General Motors-Holden's, to see that the Tribunal's recommendations are put into effect.

* If the people are to be so mistaken in their view as to fall for the emotional argument and grant prices <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and if those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be used to stabilise land prices, those who own land which is acquired deserve justice under the Australian Constitution.

* The exercise of State internal licensing <span class="highlight">powers</span> without due regard to the Australian Government's export control <span class="highlight">powers</span> could place the licensee companies in a wholly unreasonable and unfair position, when the national Government is impelled, by policy, to act in the national interest.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0)

* The Bill will also widen the regulation making <span class="highlight">powers</span> - this bothers me and, although I will simply flag it now, 1 will have much more to say about it at the relevant time on Thursday next - so that, for example, alterations can be made to the table of medical benefits contained in the Schedules to the Act by regulation rather than by the existing method which requires an amendment of the legislation.

* The prime motive of the Opposition is to attempt to influence a few voters in the forthcoming referendum against the Government's wish to have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as are possessed by every other national government to control the economy and to control the financial sector - <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0)

* We are concerned both with the lack of flexibility of the Commission and with the degree to which this Bill represents a passage to an outside authority of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we believe should be exercised by the Government itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37)

* The Opposition believes that the nature of the commission which it is proposed to establish and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it would seek to give the commission, in the terms in which the Opposition expresses those <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the amendments it moved and by the amendments supported in the Senate, would provide a much better commission than the one which the Government has in mind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39)

* We say this because we not only guarantee in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we would want to subscribe to the commission that that commission would have to take into account the requirements of all school children and of all school systems but also take into account the prior and major responsibility the States have for their State schools and independent authorities for theirs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39)

* There is one other reason which has become evident in recent times, and all too painfully evident, and it makes the composition and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that would subscribe to the Schools Commission all the more important. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39)

* If we are to have a schools commission which is not so established as to be able to look after the interests of such schools but which has <span class="highlight">powers</span> which enable it to ride roughshod over those who are primarily responsible for such schools, I submit that we will have a situation in which injustice is perpetuated within the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39)

* But the opportunity to establish a body which would properly represent all schools and administrative bodies responsible for all schools and which would have proper <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable it to discharge those responsibilities and functions, is being lost by this Government.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-37-0)

* The other main purpose of the legislation is to give the Government adequate control <span class="highlight">powers</span> over non-bank financial institutions, in line with those that presently exist with regard to banks, thereby supplementing, as necessary, existing monetary policy weapons so as to assist in the effective overall management of the economy.

* However, such <span class="highlight">powers</span> are no more extensive than those which already exist in the case of the trading banks and the Government regards it as essential that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> be available if it is to be in a position to exercise a fully effective monetary policy in the interests of the Australian people.

* That virtually means that the Commission is to be given executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to spend money, with the approval of the Minister, in any place in Australia in order to establish a health centre which could employ salaried doctors paid for by the Government, salaried dentists paid for by the Government and salaried physiotherapists and practitioners of paramedical services paid for by the Government, without reference to any of the State governments.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-23-3)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-28-0)

* Honourable members will recall that, during the first meeting of the Constitutional Convention in September last year, heads of delegations agreed in principle that the Constitution should be altered to allow for interchanges of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and to remove the existing doubts about the operation of the present power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-28-0)

* Further, I announced our intention that, in any interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whether from the Commonwealth to the States or the States to the Commonwealth, the same provisions should be available as to duration, revocability and the power to apply terms and conditions.

* To illustrate, if the Australian Parliament desired to empower the States to levy a tax which technically came within the category of excise duties - as to which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament are exclusive - it would not seem appropriate to speak of the Australian Parliament referring the matter, for the power of the Australian Parliament as regards excise is to levy a Commonwealth tax to be paid into the Commonwealth Treasury and not a State tax paid into the State Treasury.

* We are told that we must conclude the debate on these Bills by 6 o'clock tomorrow evening, and that includes not just the 4 Bills which are the subject of this cognate debate; it includes the Bill which has just been introduced, which relates to the interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and the States.

* So that in regard to the fifth Bill which is dealt with by this motion, the Constitutional Alternation (Inter-change of <span class="highlight">Powers</span>) Bill 1974, we have a fairly solid body of opinion presented by the members of the Constitutional Convention at the executive level and at the sub-committee level suggesting that they do not agree with the actions of this Government.

* 1 am afraid that when one comes to look at the provisions of the financial agreement - I will not quote them in extenso because they are very complicated and long - one finds quite considerable restrictions placed upon the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> both of the Commonwealth and the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-20)

* Here the proposal is to put the words 'the borrowing of money by the Commonwealth for local government bodies' not in relation to section 105a of the Constitution but rather with respect to section 51 of the Constitution, which is in genera] terms the plenary or the fountainhead of most of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament.

* When it can be seen that the traffic can operate in any sensible way only in one direction, it is obvious that the motive and the purpose of the Prime Minister in introducing this matter before the Australian Constitutional Convention last year was to provide a vehicle for State Labor governments to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth and so, as I said in referring to another matter before this House, to fulfil the ambition of the present Government and to enable the Prime Minister himself to aggrandise the power of the Commonwealth at the expense of the States.

* For example, in 1915 the State of New South Wales referred to the Commonwealth Parliament power with respect to the conduct of World War I. Victoria, circa 1920 or 1921, referred <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth Parliament with respect to air navigation.

* All the reasons for not referring matters which have been put forward in the past such as suggestions referring to the weakness of the present constitutional system and the fact that the States are concerned about referring <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth because they might not be able to get them back or to attach conditions to them, precedent or subsequent, surely are nonsense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* It is true that this matter is one which involved the concern of the States both as to their future and present financial status and as to the way in which they might be able to receive <span class="highlight">powers</span> referred from the Commonwealth and pass <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth so that the true concept of federalism might be achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* It is true that the Convention supported the general concept that there should be a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and a change to this part of section 51 of the Constitution as to the way by which there could be a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> but I would query quite seriously whether the Constitutional Convention, either at its opening session or in any other way, has given support to the measure before this Parliament.

* It rather sees it as necessary that there be meaningful consultation, that there be the passage of a Bill and reference to the Australian people for their support of a question on the interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which is acceptable to the members of this Parliament and acceptable to the States and, therefore, can be supported at the poll. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* This, it was thought, would have the effect of making the reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> appear truly mutual and would enhance the electoral appeal of the measure considerably. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* Secondly, it was suggested that consideration be given to amending the draft so that <span class="highlight">powers</span> designated by the Commonwealth Parliament might only be made exercisable by and available to all States, and so as not to permit a designation in favour of on: or more States only, to the exclusion of others.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15)

* The Opposition believes, also, that while the <span class="highlight">powers</span> embodied in this Bill will be useful for relative application or to be kept in reserve, that the general direction in which the application of monetary policy in Australia has been heading - that is, away from direct controls and towards market-oriented measures - should be continued.

* The views of both a former Governor of the Australian Reserve Bank and the present Governor clearly support the Opposition's position that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in the Bill before the House have the capacity to be counter productive if used without regard for their economic consequences.

* In the 1940s, when the then Labor Government introduced similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the banks under the Banking Act, it appeared at the time that they would be sufficient to exercise adequate monetary controls.

* I repeat what I have been saying since 1966-67: With the extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> proposed, the confiscation of the life offices assets would deprive the private investors of funds and would work against the policy holders and the Commonwealth's interests as well.

* Knowing the anxiety of the man most concerned, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, who is the spokesman for the people of the Territory, to see the Legislative Assembly appointed with a new membership - I particularly avoid using the word '<span class="highlight">powers</span>' because after all we do not know what <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Legislative Assembly will have - I would like to make it clear to the House and to the people of Australia that had there not been a danger that actions taken by us may have been interpreted as being obstructive, we would have done everything possible and, in fact, would have insisted on a referendum being held to ascertain how the people of the Territory themselves felt about this matter.

* It will be noticed that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been given licence to control its own destiny and to exercise its own <span class="highlight">powers</span> but, as can be seen from the speech of the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in introducing this Bill, clause 6 provides that the Board shall have power to determine rules and standards to be observed by licencees in relation to commercial broadcasting and television programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38)

* As the honourable member for Moreton mentioned, obviously there must be certain regulations and <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to all organisations in order to protect the public, but the point is that in this Bill there is no way whereby the private enterprise sector can appeal against a decision that is made.

* Although he has told us that he proposes to provide for these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be reinstated but with parliamentary scrutiny, I believe that if we examine the wording of the foreshadowed amendments it will be seen that there will not be any valid <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

* The position as I see it- it has been stated by other speakers in this debate- is that a government is not entitled to take on <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the guise that it will not use the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38)

* It means that, under Part IV of the present Act, in the examination of licences, the advertising activities of licensees and so on if, for example, a television station had given a news broadcast that was inimical to people on strike or perhaps to  Mr Laurie  Carmichael or  Mr Halfpenny  the Authority could consult those people concerning its exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under section 16 and there is no way in which that can be prevented.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38)

* I repeat the point I made before, that if one looks at the regulation making power foreshadowed by the later amendment of the honourable member for Moreton, those <span class="highlight">powers</span> at present in the Act are not conferred by regulations.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38)

* I would suggest that it is a pretty good test of the good faith of the Government in this matter to inquire: Why not put under the regulation making power the <span class="highlight">powers</span> you seek under section 16, so that the Parliament has an opportunity of considering the ramifications of any regulation which may come down and so that at the same time Parliament will have the opportunity of pronouncing, and properly so, on any discriminatory attitude adopted by the Board?

* When as a result of those matters we find that, due to domestic economic conditions, private enterprise is retracting and actually reducing its production, when we find as a result of that that there is an actual physical decline in the work force employed in Australia in the last month, a decline of 9,000 persons- and this is not a failure to grow quickly enough but an absolute, actual decline- this has a relationship to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are proposed to be conferred under this Bill.

* If I understood him correctly he pointed out that although these were <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were held under the Constitution since the Constitution was formulated, in articulating them in this way in these Bills we were drawing attention not only to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> but also, if I interpreted him correctly, to the great dangers in these <span class="highlight">powers</span>.

* As the honourable member for Lilley well knows- he is one of the few Opposition members who knows anything about this subject of economics- the fact that an importer of timber in this country is obliged to pay so much more for a cargo of timber from the west coast of America could not be affected by the new section 39 unless one imagined that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be used in some way to alter exchange rates in relation to just that one importation of timber.

* However, in view of the diversity of the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the many authorities and associations operating in Australia, and also the need to ensure that the provisions of the scheme are applied equitably to all claimants, the Bill provides that each authority and association will be required to seek approval for claimant status and be prescribed by regulation.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0)

* The wool buyers have said to me that the trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> strike at the heart of the market forces present balance and if they were used to influence existing established markets, particularly in terms of the export of processed wools, they could quite seriously prejudice the operations of those in the private sector. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0)

* With respect to the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be included in section 40 of the Act, as amended by clause 13 of this Bill, it is necessary that the Australian Wool Corporation does not abuse particularly the power to buy and sell at auction or otherwise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0)

* If it does so, it must be quite conscious of the degree to which, by the tremendous power it can exercise, it can distort the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the market place in such a way as to prejudice the long term returns to wool growers and the long term interests of the wool industry itself.

* The present <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation in this area were originally designed principally to enable it to dispose of the wool purchased under its reserve price operations and, although they extend somewhat beyond this, they include restrictions which hamper the Corporation in some transactions.

* I would say that if we examine the relationship between metropolitan <span class="highlight">powers</span> and administered entities- whether it be with African countries, whether it be Fiji and the United Kingdom or what other entity one chooses- we would see that there has probably not been an administered area which was as close to the metropolitan power, not geographically but in the way it moved towards its independence- as Papua New Guinea used to be to us.

* It is all right for members of the Opposition to talk about private enterprise and to go through all the rigmarole and emotionalism connected with this, but the Government wants to give to the Australian Wool Corporation <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will not hamper it in any way so that it is able to carry out its job in the best interests of the wool industry.

* With knowledge of Labor Party policy re the abolition of the Senate and a record of defeat of referenda proposals, one cannot but arrive at the observation that the Federal Government, aggrieved by the regulator placed on it by the people in the Senate, is out to achieve by judicial means <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it cannot obtain through the Senate or referenda.

* I believe that it is true that, within the Constitution, we should take cognisance of placitum (xxxvii) of section 51, being the reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> placitum, and section 128, that being the other manner within which there can be constitutional change within the Constitution, and determine the degree to which we see that as the fundamental basis by which the Constitution should be changed.

* It is felt that to open the field of regulation making <span class="highlight">powers</span> to such far-reaching consequences to some effect destroys the institution of the national Parliament which of course has its time well taken up in dealing with a whole range of issues, from domestic issues to matters relating to foreign affairs, international codes, international agreements and so on.

* These included possible Government involvement in the Australian capital market and industrial structure arising from the proposed additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, extended functions and privileges of the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the implications for other financial institutions in the money and capital market arising from the financing activities of the AIDC and the NIF; the consequent implications for resource use in the economy and the attainment of other economic and social objectives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* That is an important distinction because the Constitution of Australia gives to the High Court the authority to declare legislation constitutionally invalid by reason of the fact that the legislation does not fall within any of the expressed <span class="highlight">powers</span> given by. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* There can be no doubt that the Prime Minister in advising the Governor-General pursuant to the Constitution to appoint the then  Senator Murphy  to the High Court took every political advantage at his command and given to him by the Constitution of Australia to appoint his own AttorneyGeneral to the High Court at a time when the Prime Minister knew that a number of pieces of legislation introduced by his Government and passed by this Parliament, either in the ordinary way of passing legislation or after a joint sitting of the 2 Houses, are subject to litigation in the High Court on the grounds that they are constitutionally invalid as not falling within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth under the Constitution.

* The main purpose of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the Commonwealth Railways Act 1917-1973 in order to create the Australian National Railways Commission, thus providing for the increasingly wider functions and responsibilities of Commonwealth Railways including the transfer of State railways; to ensure that the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, duties and functions of the proposed Commission are, where possible, consistent with other statutory authorities with a similar nature; to make amendments to the Act, which will bring it into line with current commercial practices of statutory authorities; and to overcome administrative problems raised by the Auditor-General.

* The amendments will also enable the proposed Commission effectively to perforin its role as one of Australia's major rail systems and provide it with the organisational structure and operational <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary for it to consolidate into a single system, the State railways, that may be transferred under the Government 's rail transfer program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0)

* Whilst recognising that a rule-making authority must be given power to ensure effective and speedy regulatory action by a Commission, there is no justification in our view for such <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be unlimited in duration; not subject to appeal; and given also to the executive Government upon an equally unlimited basis as to duration and ambit.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30)

* With knowledge of the unlawful, intemperate and arbitrary acts of the former Attorney-General it would not be wise to confer <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the incumbent uninformed and inexperienced AttorneyGeneral when there are more effective methods of achieving the same goals through regulations that may be disallowed by either House.

* We are not presupposing that it will be ultra vires; we are concerned with whether its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are too wide and will be used by the Commission, with the Government's support, to make incursions that are unjustified but are in accordance with the socialist objective.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20)

* I simply inquire of the Attorney-General whether, having regard to the extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission, it is a satisfactory state of affairs, for example, for a member of the Commission who has a substantial financial holding in a particular class of security to disclose his interest.

* I just mention this on the basis that unless there is, and there certainly was not when we had to consider this Bill, adequate appeal procedure, then the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are so broad as to suggest that the Government did not have a clear idea of what it intended this Commission to do.

* Of course it is enormously difficult to arrange the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission- and under clause 61, the Governor-General, which of course means the Government- to deal with this prohibition problem in relation to trading on the stock market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20)

* It is not a justification of the clause for the Minister to say: 'We have to make the <span class="highlight">powers</span> wide because we do not know how to inhibit actions properly and anyway, the fellows who are to be appointed will be jolly good fellows and we can trust them'.

* Mainly because I felt that the Bill was too technical, was far too detailed and lacked flexibility, and because the Government had shown that it was completely incapable of managing the economy, I came to the conclusion that if the Government was so incompetent it should not be given any further <span class="highlight">powers</span>.

* It can be seen by parity of reasoning that much the same applies in the case of clause 283 which empowers the Commission to make statutory rules in relation to 'any matter in respect of which the Commission is permitted by subsection 59(3) to make rules'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0)

* On the one hand it is saying that many of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission are too wide and arbitrary, while on the other aspects, it says, the Commission should nave stronger <span class="highlight">powers</span>  In other words he is indicating that the Commission should have the power to act more quickly and decisively.

* The experience of the States during the past decade in the Australian Federation is that whilst they have been left with de jure responsibility for particular areas of government services, because of their financial starvation they have been forced again and again to hand <span class="highlight">powers</span> over to the Federal Government.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-38-0)

* We are advised generally that at the present time section 38a of the Judiciary Act has the effect that only the High Court may decide questions as to the limits  inter se  of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and those of the States, and that present section 40a provides for automatic removal to the High Court of cases commenced in other courts which raise such a question.

* So, if we transfer the present reading of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General to the other sections of the Constitution which deal with, for instance, the dissolution of the Parliament, the prorogation of the Parliament and the sending of messengers by the GovernorGeneral recommending appropriations, we find that a situation has been created in which there is one person with absolute authority in this country over this Parliament, over its governance and answerable to none.

* In those circumstances, and with the patience the Commonwealth has shown to this point in relation to the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Industrial Commission being defied, the Commonwealth is not prepared to stand by with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to it and not use those <span class="highlight">powers</span>.

* An Australian Meat Board was first established by the Meat Export Control Act 1935, and with the exception of the period from 1943 to 1946 during World War II when the Board went into recess, the Meat Board has continued ever since although various changes in its composition and <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been made from time to time.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-50-0)

* The Corporation is to have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> in these areas in respect of meat and it is a logical development for the Corporation to be able to exercise similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> over livestock exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-50-0)

* Without broad control <span class="highlight">powers</span> it would not have been possible for the Australian Meat Board to have fulfilled Australia's obligations to regulate meat exports to the United States of America under the voluntary restraint and quota arrangements which have existed at various times since 1968.

* These <span class="highlight">powers</span> would include rights of entry and inspection for consistency of product or animal against contract specifications, rights to take samples for purposes of analysis, and recommending a method by which disputes relating to product standards arising between overseas buyers and Australian suppliers could be settled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-50-0)

* For this reason, the Bill has been framed with the intention that the Corporation would use its control <span class="highlight">powers</span> only when it considered such action to be necessary to further the interests of Australian livestock producers and Australian industries concerned with the preparation of meat for export or the export of meat or livestock. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-50-0)

* Whilst the Government might have adopted that stance from the point of view of endeavouring to indicate to the trade union movement that it was going to do all sorts of dreadful and dire things, it ought to be looking at what is the present law as regards its <span class="highlight">powers</span>.

* It is important- my comments also apply to clause 26- that the Government just cannot assume that it has unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do what it likes with a trade union organisation simply because it has the power to settle industrial disputes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* I have heard that  Mr Justice  Alley might be appointed and if that is so then the second most senior member of the firm of Moule, Hamilton and Denham would not appeal to me as being a particularly good sort of appointment to be given independent <span class="highlight">powers</span> when the next Labor Government gains office.

* The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  said in his agreement with the unions that the Bureau would have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate and that it would utilise the same processes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* But in fact what the Government is seeking to do here is to give the Bureau more <span class="highlight">powers</span> than applied to the Inspectorate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* If the Government is really concerned with the industrial relations environment, sticking by its word and providing that the Bureau has the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, no more or less, and abides by the same procedures and processes it will amend the Act so that the Bureau is subject to ministerial control. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* Let us reflect that on Tuesday 17 May, 5 senior Ministers of the Fraser Government met with the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,  Mr Hawke,  and agreed to accept his proposals that the Government establish the Industrial Relations Bureau without increasing existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and legal obligations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and that the National Labour Advisory Council be reconstituted on a statutory basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* These comments were notoriously contrary to the assurances on the IRB's <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were given by  Mr Street  and the other senior Cabinet Ministers just 2 days beforehand and which formed the basis for the trade unions decision to accept the IRB legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* Pending the detailed consideration of the Act referred to later in this statement, the Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more, no less, and those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be exercised according to the same processes as they have been until now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* I have stressed that the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be  excercised  by the Industrial Relations Bureau when it is formed will be the same as those currently exercised by the Arbitration Inspectorate and the processes followed by the Bureau will be those followed by the Arbitration Inspectorate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* So the Government is changing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of the Bureau by freeing it from ministerial control and it is then obliging the Bureau, by statutory requirement that it secure compliance with the awards, to change the processes.

* We object to the Bureau, whether the agreement is complied with entirely or not, but I hope that if the Government is not going to scrap the Bureau it will at least make sure that the Bureau is subject to the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> and processes which it agreed with the unions in the first place would be the case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The wool buyers have said to me that the trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> strike at the heart of the market forces present balance and if they are used to influence existing established markets, particularly in terms of export of processed wools, they could quite seriously prejudice the operations of those in the private sector.

* In the process of floating his notions about the proposed structure of the Board and its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions, we find the result is that the organisations representing livestock producers are at each other's throats and the Australian Meat Exporters' Federal Council is attacking both the livestock producer organisations and the Minister.

* I think it is also pertinent to note that a comparison of the Ministerial involvement under the Meat Industry Act, which is the Act which this legislation is replacing, and the Bill which we are debating, the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation Bill, reveals that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Minister has at his disposal are very similar between the 2 pieces of legislation.

* Some of the original <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be redundant and have probably not been used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* I will just recount some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Government has removed from this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* We see not just a rationalisation of the Authority's <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we could accept but the complete hamstringing of the Authority by the insertion of clause 1 1 . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* Even though those <span class="highlight">powers</span> were not being used, they were there and could be called upon if necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* The Authority set up under the Act was given a vast range of functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were inherent in the socialist left aims of the Government in power at that time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* -There is no doubt that the legislation we are considering proposes to reduce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the national Pipeline Authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* I do so because we on this side of the House want to see the Pipeline Authority, one of the great visions of Rex Connor in his time as Minister for Minerals and Energy, retain the <span class="highlight">powers</span> originally given to it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* The Authority's <span class="highlight">powers</span> in that area should be left intact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0)

* If there is a lessening of tension in that area, if there is an extension of co-operation on matters of importance, not only to those two super <span class="highlight">powers</span> but to the whole world, the cause of peace and disarmament generally is advanced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-15-0)

* However, before such <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be exercised in any particular case, there will need to be a request by the Director-General to the Minister who in turn must be satisfied as to the need for the action before granting a warrant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0)

* From the States' point of view the benefit of the arrangement is that their legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not eroded by an unrestricted exercise of the Commonwealth's external affairs power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* A new section 15 is substituted which provides broad enabling <span class="highlight">powers</span> under which standards of competence to be attained and other conditions to be satisfied in order to be 'qualified' for the purposes of the Act will be specified by regulation or by order under the regulations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Uniform Shipping Laws Code which I have mentioned extends to a wide range of matters besides qualifications and the Act contains <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable legal effect to be given to those other sections of the code. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* There is provision to ensure that, for reasons of safety of life and navigation, the provisions of the Navigation Act giving the Minister <span class="highlight">powers</span> regarding removal will still apply to any wreck, whether declared historic or not. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* To the extent that the USSR can be encouraged to contribute to the development of independent countries while preserving thenindependent development, a most valuable contribution will have been made not just to those countries but to a more harmonious relationship between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0)

* But giving it wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the dismissal of people for any reason which is provided for under clause 7 of this Bill is something to which we on the Opposition side of the House and to which people who will be subject to the provisions of this Bill are opposed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0)

* We join with members of the Commonwealth Public Service who believe that the manner in which this Bill is drafted leaves open to a government which has shown no sincerity at all to its own employees, <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will politicise the Public Service in a way which is totally unacceptable to the Australian community, and a way which was never intended by the people who formed these parliaments that the Public Service should be used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0)

* The only way an employee can escape the arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Bill, as I indicated before, is by dobbing in his work mate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0)

* Clause 7 also gives frightening <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Government and its permanent heads. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0)

* In accordance with that decision, a three-member committee of review will be appointed to consider and report to the Government on the services, policies and performance of the Commission under its present statutory charter, and recommend appropriate future objectives, functions, statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and policies of the Commission.

* The essence of the whole debate on this Bill, is whether or not the Government gathers to itself the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to dismiss people for reasons which are not stated in the Bill and without allowing its actions to be subject to the scrutiny of this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32)

* The Opposition is concerned about the relationship between the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Public Service Board and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the permanent head as contained in clause 9 which is titled 'Efficient and economical use of staff'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32)

* I am sure that the Opposition knows that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided for by this Bill lie not with the Government but with the permanent heads and the Public Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32)

* There is no way in which the Government can lean on or seek to corrupt the Public Service Board or the permanent heads in the exercise of their <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32)

* The oil crisis of 1973 followed the recognition by the Middle Eastern <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they could not go on subsidising a Western and Japanese economic miracle forever, given the fact that for many of these countries oil was their only major asset and bargaining tool. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0)

* But yet again the Government would neither confirm nor deny what it was going to do even though it knew that it had clear <span class="highlight">powers</span> to direct the Australian Wheat Board to raise funds outside the regular Reserve Bank arrangements.

* The constitutional validity of its legislation is now under attack as it should be, by the metal trades in the High Court in an attempt to justify the punitive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Industrial Relations Bureau. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0)

* The second Bill simply specifies the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Wheat Board to raise money by the issue of approved securities and to empower the Minister for Primary Industry to provide a Commonwealth guarantee or repayment in connection with those securities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Bill is specifically designed so that the existing general <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board may be used to borrow commercially and to take advantage of types of money market facilities presently available to a body such as the Australian Wheat Board for the raising of money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-25-0)

* I would like to think that the Wheat Board is able to stand up to these people and to see that the efforts which they are making at the moment to ensure that its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are reduced fail. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-25-0)

* I hope that the Minister in charge of this Department, the Minister for Primary Industry, will see that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Wheat Board are not divested, that it continues to maintain strong control over the wheat industry, but that it is not used in a cynical way, as it has been in the past, to implement the misguided economic policies of the Government.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-25-0)

* We are conscious of the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  in his second reading speech that the Bills were introduced to specify the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Wheat Board to raise moneys by the issue of approved securities and to empower the Minister for Primary Industry to provide a Commonwealth guarantee of repayment in connection with those securities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-25-0)

* I entirely agree with them because, in spite of what the Minister said in his second reading speech about the Government's specifying only those <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Wheat Board already has, the difference is that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> have never been used before. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-25-0)

* My amendment is designed to leave the Comptroller of Customs with the responsibility of discharging certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> and authorities conferred upon him by this Parliament and to enforce the law, particularly in regard to drug and narcotic trafficking, but it precludes that information from Ministers on the same basis that this Parliament precludes from Ministers information about the taxation affairs of any individual and, in a similar way but not quite so strictly, precludes from Ministers information about health and social security matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35)

* They too are human, but in giving them these special <span class="highlight">powers</span> we are endeavouring to ensure that, even in error, they will not be abused or wrongly used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35)

* Provided the onus of proof will still be on the Government- in other words, the Government or the Crown will still have to prove to the High Court that the goods were imported and therefore the Government was acting within its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>- I do not suppose it matters much.

* When the Commissioner, in the exercise of discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> under section 136, substitutes for these his estimate of what would have had to be paid in an arm 's length trading situation, his action does not carty an implication that the returns lodged by the taxpayers were designed to mislead or to provide less than a full and true disclosure of all the facts required by law to be disclosed.

* Having created an acceptable pricing policy, I am quite certain that eventually we will be forced to establish a national oil corporation, similar to the British national oil corporation, perhaps partially funded by the resource rent tax on existing producers and with <span class="highlight">powers</span> to raise its own further finance to participate in exploration, development of new wells and the marketing of its own oil.

* That quote was not dragged out of the air by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen);  it was a statement made by the Attorney-General in the public media at a time when, it has to be presumed, he understood and had knowledge of the very considerable rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he had under this legislation.

* Nevertheless, I think that even the Minister for Administrative Services who is sitting at the table will agree that the events in relation to what has been called, perhaps wrongly, the Greek conspiracy case give us cause for doubt about the very organisation to which we are now giving these very great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0)

* I say quite frankly to the Minister that if these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be given to the Australian Federal Police, inevitably the Minister responsible will have to be involved in questions of law.

* Since the debate on these matters last took place we have had very disquieting evidence about the organisation to which we gave the <span class="highlight">powers</span>- the Narcotics Bureau. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0)

* Another fact of life is that there are thousands and thousands of policemen throughout Australia, and if only ten per cent of the case is rotten it means that a lot of policemen in Australia can hardly be trusted with excessive <span class="highlight">powers</span>.

* I hope that at all times it will be recognised that the police are now being given <span class="highlight">powers</span> which they have never previously possessed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0)

* We are handing over to a police force, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have never before been handed over, except in the name of national security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0)

* I am equally concerned that the dealer is apprehended, but I add as a proviso that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be closely examined before they are handed over, to ensure that we are not eroding one area in an attempt to bring about arrests in another area.

* That is true, but I think in fairness to the Government- and the honourable member for Fadden  (Mr Donald Cameron)  has made this point- I should say that the Bills simply transfer from the disbanded Narcotics Bureau to the Australian Federal Police the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were debated at considerable length earlier this year.

* However, the Government also believes that its responsibilities to the public and to individuals make it imperative that it use all its available <span class="highlight">powers</span> to encourage trade unions and employers to work within the established framework and, where necessary, to take strong measures to ensure that they do.
