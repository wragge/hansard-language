* As the Minister for Health  (Dr Forbes)  has already advised in the other place, the recommendations of the Nimmo Committee regarding hospital benefits had implications of such a far reaching <span class="highlight">nature</span> that the Government is not in a position to make decisions on them at. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34)

* As I indicated in my opening remarks, the Government is not prepared, nor is it reasonable to expect it to do so, to change a long standing policy of this kind without having an opportunity for investigation of the proposed change in detail along with questions of a similar <span class="highlight">nature</span>, such as the provision generally of ancillary medical services under the health benefits plan.

* 1 think it is a very good thing that a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> should come before the Senate because not only will it result in the provision of the assistance outlined in the Bill but it also gives us an opportunity to express our appreciation to the dedicated people who have served in this field and given the love, affection and care which is so necessary in assisting handicapped children.

* Although the Opposition supports the Bill, I feel that it should be pointed om that, as with so many matters related to education in particular and to government budgeting in matters of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in general - in this case a very substantial figure of $30m is provided for a service, namely, the addition to and development of existing teachers training colleges - there appears to be no system whereby such large sums are arrived at.

* These laws do something which I think ought to be avoided wherever possible, and that is to put a strict and a low limit on the liability of the carriers in the event of an accident even where there has been negligence, except in some cases where the negligence is of a particularly gross <span class="highlight">nature</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-38-0)

* Of course, this is an absurd limitation, for 2 reasons: The first is that, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of aircraft, the accident may well lead, as may a motor vehiole accident, to severe injuries, such as spinal injuries, where the damages may be very much in excess of $15,000 for medical and other expenses, which are not at the moment recoverable under our national health scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-38-0)

* But it is a very serious position if millions of dollars held by funds in reserves could be channelled into a particular company and a person who is a shareholder in that company - perhaps in a minor way - could see to it that the financial power of the fund is brought into that same company in such a way that it might be used to see that he is permitted to be a director in the fund, or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>.

* In this connection I might mention that the Premiers have indicated that, in the absence of Commonwealth legislation to impose receipts duty where it is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an excise, the States would be unlikely to be able to impose receipts duty where it is not in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an excise.

* Sugar cane grows to a height of 6 feet or 7 feet in north Queensland and it has a fairly high commercial content of sugar, but it docs not do as well in the Bundaberg area because of the generally semi-arid <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the soil and the unseasonal conditions that have occurred in the area over a period of years.

* We gave some attention to particular aspects of tariff-making: The complexity of the Tariff Schedule, the scope for anticipatory duties, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of existing international obligations and, nut least important, the problems created by the attitude, somewhat too prevalent, that once an industry exists it should receive all the protection it needs.

* The relevant section establishing the financial <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Corporation is Part 5, section 24, and we would ask you and your colleagues to read this particular paragraph carefully and ask yourselves the question, having regard to the restrictions discussed above, as to how any Corporation could possibly carry out these requirements, when the number of staff and the work to be done are all determined by the Minister.

* Yet, despite the very restrictive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the future operations of the proposed Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation as set out in the Bill, particularly in clause 11, it is expected, as  Senator Willesee  has pointed out, that the Corporation will operate as a commercial organisation in competition with private enterprise and that it will have to pay Commonwealth income taxation and at the same time be expected to have a reasonable return on its capital.

* I think about the only time that we achieve any agreement with honourable senators opposite is when it is decided that the Senate should rise at 5 p.m. instead of 6 p.m. We seem to be able to obtain unanimous approval from the Opposition in relation to matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, but when it comes to worthwhile legislation which is to the benefit of the majority of the people of this country who wanted a Labor government, we find this continual frustration, either by way of direct opposition by moving amendments which are unacceptable to the Government, or by moving amendments of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> which do neither one thing nor the other.

* In its projection to the people the Government has been singularly silent about the terms and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this legislation; wisely so too because the people of the several States of Australia, in the full knowledge of the consequences of this Bill, would have responded vigorously and negatively against it.

* -I know that that situation is supported by a number of honourable senators opposite and people in the various State branches of the Liberal Party, but I repeat that it poisons the relationship between this country and the United Kingdom that we should continue to have British appointed judges determining matters, even those of a domestic <span class="highlight">nature</span>, over in London.

* It is well and fitting and appropriate that on an historic occasion such as this, when the debate will be recorded in perpetuity, that the fallacious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Labor Party's administration and argument is recorded, particularly the way in which the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  who is the current Minister for the Northern Territory, vilified and attacked the member for Northern Territory  (Mr Calder).

* I hope that such a Centre would give full support to the development of new concepts in the training of these pupils and in the development of curricula for these pupils, so they will see some relation between the school and the world at large and they will be better equipped, I hope, to cope with the world at large when they leave; better equipped to cope with everything they come up against, from the blandishments of advertisers, I suppose, to the importuning of finance companies, to the duplicities of politicians and everyone else and even the perfidiousness of <span class="highlight">nature</span> itself.

* I think it would be a dangerous thing indeed if we were to find curriculum development dependent almost totally on the findings of somewhat ivorytowered conceptions, because the danger that confronts us is that many of the theories and attitudes that are produced so simply and so perfectly, closeted away in some study atmosphere, seem to fall down when they come out into the laboratory of the outside world and come into conflict with human <span class="highlight">nature</span> and all the problems that human <span class="highlight">nature</span> has for all sorts of theories.

* For example, if somebody is engaged in a hazardous occupation, such as mining and quarrying or building and construction, as compared with a relatively unhazardous occupation, such as the retail trade or employing clerical workers, the more hazardous occupation may in fact be more socially necessary than the unhazardous occupation, but of its <span class="highlight">nature</span> it is more dangerous.
