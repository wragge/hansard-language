* Despite the fact that no doubt the motion will be carried I think the way in which we can express our disapproval of the manner in which the business has been conducted - the indefiniteness of it and the irregularity of it in the way I have explained - is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion.

* The Australian Labor Party may have set up the Australian Wheat Board on a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the wheat industry; but, having set it up, in 1945-46 the then Labor Government decided to do its own marketing behind the back of the Wheat Board - the board which had been set up by the wheat industry and which should have been given the responsibilities and respect that it deserved, I have certain papers in my office.

* In summing up I do not cover again all the ground that is common ground in relation to amalgam professions and all the other matters that have been commented on: i simply say that, in the interests of the overwhelming majority of the legal profession of the ACT and in pursuance of something in which I believe, I intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the disallowance of these provisions.

* But when one can sec that the 2 views coincide and that the public interest is not being adversely affected in any way - in fact, although 1 do not intend to develop this argument, it may very well be that the public interest is being enhanced by a better organised profession and that a better organised profession may very well be the profession that suits the majority of the members, which is the normal principle that one would expect to apply- one is in the position where one should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the disallowance of the relevant provisions, and f propose to do so on this occasion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0)

* Therefore, 1 am asking for leave to move a motion for a reconsideration of the vole on the estimates of the Department of Housing which, if leave is granted, will enable me to move that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Department of Housing be reconsidered.

* If only one of the senators who missed the division had been present the Opposition motion would have still been defeated, because the rules of the Senate relating to an equal <span class="highlight">vote</span> are such that we would have lost the <span class="highlight">vote</span>.

* I indicate that we propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this motion because it merely illustrates the determination of the AttorneyGeneral to show that last Thursday night he, not the Senate, was right.

* I would like to make this comment: Whilst this is primarily a Senate matter - I can understand that perhaps the Government has no need for pairs in this place; it may think that it will always be in the minority if the 3 Opposition groups combine and therefore a pair or two does not matter, and that whether the Government loses by one <span class="highlight">vote</span> or by 4 votes is immaterial - I, of course, must have discussions with my parliamentary leader, the Leader of the Opposition in another place, because if the same course were adopted by the Opposition in the other place - at this moment I have no knowledge of whether it would be adopted - the working of government would become impossible.

* When the Opposition persisted in refusing even to give the Government equality of representation - not a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but simply equality of representation - on a. committee which was to be set up for the whole purpose, and the only purpose, as  Senator Carrick  said, to aim at the Attorney-General, the Government was entitled to take the view - and my Whip took the view - that this was a motion of no confidence and that in those circumstances he would not agree to any pairs in the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0)

* The Government, without notice, without any indication beforehand that this course was to be adopted, and in order to secure a <span class="highlight">vote</span> favourable to it, decided that all pairs would be called off. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0)

* Senator Murphy  said that this <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight was tantamount to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence in a Minister and therefore there was some unwritten rule that he could break the pairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0)

* 
 Mr Acting Deputy President, the purpose of these amendments is perfectly clear: The principle of 'one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value' must be established as the fundamental objective of redistribution and our intentions were publicised before the last elections at which the people elected an Australian Labor Party government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* Factors such as 'the area of the Division', the density or sparsity of population ' and references to 'disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance' inserted by the previous Government in 1965, are contrary to the concept of equality of political rights and encourage departure from the quota of electors in a manner which makes the value of a citizen's <span class="highlight">vote</span> depend largely upon his geographical location. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* The changes proposed by this Bill are designed to provide by legislative measures that, as far as may be practicable, the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen shall be equivalent to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another and to give some meaningful application to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value' without unneccessarily restricting the Distribution Commissioners in proposing a redistribution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* 1 conclude my remarks as I commenced them: We in the Liberal Party reject this legislation and will continue to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against legislation associated with the Electoral Act when such legislation seeks to alter the impartiality of the Act as it has existed over the past 70 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* I recall that the question arose as to the relationship between statutory corporations and the Estimates Committees, and the Senate confirmed by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate as a whole the decision of an estimates committee of which, I think,  Senator Rae  was the  chairman  that, in effect, statutory corporations must be accountable to the parliamentary committee for their financial arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* I should simply like to indicate that, whilst 1 oppose the death penalty and support the Death Penalty Abolition Bill and intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment that has been moved by  Senator Jessop,  I believe that there is a very strong case for considering the point in relation to this matter that was raised by  Senator Webster  and other honourable senators. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* For instance, let those honourable senators who are likely to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this amendment imagine themselves sitting in an aircraft in which perhaps the stewardess has just been murdered, which is the only circumstance about which we are talking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* I voted against that penalty because it extended the law of capital punishment which had been reserved up until that time only for actual achieved murder. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* I refused to give my <span class="highlight">vote</span> to extend capital punishment to an attempt to murder. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* I pause for a moment to indicate that I face a number of honourable senators who do not enjoy that privilege of freedom of individual <span class="highlight">vote</span>, honourable senators who, in a matter of this excruciating conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span>, speak from the book of Caucus. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* Having voted in Cabinet against my government's proposal to extend the law regarding capital punishment to an attempt to hijack an aircraft, I point out that when you are not a member of a government you have a duty to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the floor of the House according to your individual judgment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* All of my colleagues believe that this is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a matter which we had determined when we were outside the Australian Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* Therefore  Senator Wright  should cast no reflection at all upon any Government supporter as a result of his attitude on this difficult question but should accept the principle that our <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this question is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> - but a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> determined years ago when we joined the Australian Labor Party and examined the issues and considered the whole problem of society's approach to criminal offences and determined our total opposition to capital punishment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* The honourable senator should see that we appreciate the action of those members of the Opposition who have, we believe, adopted an enlightened attitude, who have in conscience decided to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the various amendments that have been submitted for debate in this place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* I repeat that I have moved this amendment because, as the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  announced when the debate on this Bill commenced many months ago, the opportunity would be taken during the debate in the Committee stage of the Bill, because members of the Opposition had differing views on the matter and had a freedom to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they pleased, to move amendments and identify areas in which it may be thought desirable that the death penalty be retained. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* Although honourable senators opposite have been given a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this debate, I think it is probably time that the views he is expressing represent properly the views held by some honourable senators opposite. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58)

* The first is that ever since the first measure of this nature was introduced in 1968 until the last <span class="highlight">vote</span> which has been taken, I have voted in accordance with my conscience which is very clear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0)

* There are a number of other matters to which I would normally allude but because of the lateness of the hour and because of our desire to see a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken on this matter I suggest that the Senate should reject the amendment moved by  Senator Rae  and the amendment proposed to be moved by  Senator McManus  in the event of  Senator Rae's  amendment being defeated.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* But knowing that the Australian Democratic Labor Party has joined the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party so that if the Opposition amendment were put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> it would be successful, I merely lodge my objection on behalf of the Government to the amendment proposed by  Senator Rae.

* By the second, we aim to give a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums- I am a little with you,  Mr President,  in finding this a bit harsh on the ears but I think it is the way in which it has been chosen to refer to it in the Bill, although I have some regrets about it.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* If a clear majority of the electors who <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum are in favour of a proposed law, their will should not be frustrated because separate majorities of electors have not been obtained in a majority of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* The Committee's proposal would not disturb the Federal fabric of the Constitution, inherent in section 128, but its proposal would serve to lay more emphasis on Constitutional change by the democratic process of majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> than there at present exists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* This provision, in respect of the requirement to have 'a majority of the States' as one of the conditions for the passing of a referendum, does not, in our view, put the right emphasis and value on a national <span class="highlight">vote</span> and imposes an undesirable rigidity on the system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* We are one nation, we are one people, and on national issues it is desirable that the will of the nation should be determined more by the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all the people entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> than by State borders. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* By the new proposal, it will still be possible to obtain an amendment of the Constitution only if a majority of all the electors voting agree, but instead of requiring a majority of the States- which at present means 4 out of the 6 States, and thus a two-thirds majority- what we are proposing is that a majority of voters in not less than half of the States will be necessary, as well as an overall majority of voters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original 6 States, means in the elegant words of the Constitution Review Committee that 'for every State in which there is an adverse <span class="highlight">vote</span> there must be a favourable <span class="highlight">vote</span> in two states ... a Constitutional change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States.

* Whether the people want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the proposals, the Government said to them: 'We undertake as part of the program upon which we ask you to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us that we will put to you certain proposals so that you may decide whether you want to alter your Constitution'.

* For example, we heard during the course of the last debate- and I do not desire to transgress the Standing Orders by referring to it- that the Opposition was denying to the people of Australia the chance to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon these referendum proposals by advancing an argument against them in this chamber. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* So in this chamber, when we hear from no less a person than the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  that the Opposition is seeking to deny to the people of Australia an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter, by simply voting and arguing against it, he is denying that which he should know and, I believe, that which he does know, and that is that there is a right to put this question to the people irrespective of how the <span class="highlight">vote</span> ensues in this chamber. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* We know from statements which the Prime Minister has made over the years, such as the statement, emanating from 1957, in which he said that members of the State Parliament had an obligation and that obligation was to <span class="highlight">vote</span> themselves out of power, that what he is looking for is the centralised control from Canberra. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* If we are to let this country develop in the future on a basis that Canberra will determineas the Labor Party wants Canberra to determine- what will be the facilities available in local areas right throughout the land, let us <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this proposal which is now being considered in the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* But if we believe that wherever communities exist they ought to have a voice to say what they want in their own area, and that if they are not given what they want from their representatives in the area they can <span class="highlight">vote</span> them out and put in a different group of local representatives, we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this proposal and, believe me, we will keep a Liberal Government in power in Australia.

* The fact is that it does not matter whether we debate them because the temporary majority that exists in this chamber has already made up its mind that it is going to deny to the people of Australia the opportunity of expressing an opinion on matters that were clearly placed before them and supported by their majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> in 1 972.

* -Before I address myself to the provisions of the Bill before the Senate, I should like to say that I am grateful to  Senator Gietzelt  for having corrected some of his colleagues who expressed the view that what the Opposition was trying to do was to prevent the people of Australia from exercising their <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this legislation not because I wish to deny to the people of Australia the right to decide on the issue involved but because I want to make it clear that I am not giving the seal of approval to the Government to bring in legislation, no matter how it is presented and for what motives it is presented, that will further diminish the powers and responsibilities of the State governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* If an Australian Government elected by the people wishes to put a proposition to the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to change their Constitution, will any person in this Parliament deny the right of the Australian Government to go to its own people and say: 'We ask you to change your own Constitution and we want you to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a free and regular election on whether you choose to change your own Constitution'? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* We will go out and we will ask the Australian people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against them because we do not agree with them, but never would we deny the right of a government elected by the people to go to its own people and say 'We, the Government of Australia, ask you to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to change your Constitution in such and such a manner'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* Yes, the over-reaching of a temporary majority in this place which dares to intervene between the Government elected by the people and the people themselves when the Government simply desires to seek their <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether they would change their own Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* It has lumped these 2 proposals together either because it does not really want those living in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to be given a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on proposals to alter the Constitution, or because it is hoping to float through its proposals to simplify altering the Constitution on a wave of sympathy for the electors in the Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* Is it just that residents in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory should be denied their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on referenda because the ALP will insist on this conglomerate Bill? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* When this Bill came before the Senate last December the Opposition insisted upon an amendment to the long title so that it would be clear that the major intention was to allow electors in the mainland Territories to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* The Government subsequently disallowed the amendment in the House of Representatives and by so doing telegraphed to the Australian people that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the Territories was merely chocolate coating on a bitter pill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* So, in an attempt to overcome what it fears will be a no <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the people, it seeks to change the longstanding method by which alterations to the Constitution can be effected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* The reaction of the majority of Australian voters when they <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the referendum is very likely to be one of annoyance at a government which has virtually prevented them approving referenda voting by electors in the Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* Insofar as the Constitution is a solemn compact, a solemn contract, in which the States have this most important role, it seems to me to be basic logic that if that instrument is to be subject  to  change and if the States are to have a continuance of their primary significance there must be an overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the States as such for or against any alteration to the compact of federation, the Constitution itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* It would appear to me to be a departure that if we are not going to insist upon a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the majority of States to vary the Constitution but enable the referendum to be passed on an equality of State votes, together with a majority of the aggregate of the people 's votes it will be, to use my original term, a misconception of the very nature of the compact of federation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* We support that concept which would give all Territorians the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on propositions altering the Constitution because, after all, variations in the Constitution are matters of great concern to them.

* First of all, attention has been called to section 23, which we have debated previously; but in accordance with rulings which prevail in this chamber, a decision as to the passage of a Bill or- let me be more precise- a decision on a question arising in this Senate shall be determined by a majority of votes, each senator having one <span class="highlight">vote</span>.

* The question you put,  Mr President,  was resolved in the affirmative, but since that affirmative <span class="highlight">vote</span> did not carry an absolute majority of the Senate you should declare that the Bill is forthwith laid aside and that it will not be revived.

* The Opposition parties have always maintained the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value but in a practical sense so that you can have a period of, say, 10 years within which you will have a rough equality throughout that period and not require a census and a redistribution every 3 years.

* I suppose the most democratic form of election is the proportional representation system which ensures that the representation in the parliament will reflect completely the will of all the people who are entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and which will give the minorities as well as the majorities the right to have voices in the parliament.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-16-0)

* For the Northern Territory, with 36,000 electors to send to this place 2 senators and operate with an efficacy of <span class="highlight">vote</span> one-fifth of the voting power of New South Wales which has 3 million population is just a denial, a defeating, of the fundamental basis upon which the Senate was constructed.

* Therefore any senator who represents the people of his State has, I think a most superficial understanding of the Constitution and really does not represent the purpose of the people of the State if he allows 36,000 people of the Northern Territory to send in here 2 Territorial representatives or senators- one-fifth of the number representing New South Walesand, having regard to the even balance of the Senate, probably to exercise the preponderant <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate.

* The word 'reject' when used in the Parliamentary sense in which those who drafted section 5B used it, conveys to my mind the idea that a Bill has either been taken into consideration by a legislative body and after deliberation upon its merits has been rejected by an adverse <span class="highlight">vote</span> or that there has been an unqualified refusal to consider it.

* If we <span class="highlight">vote</span> that way, it would be not just an Opposition protest- I hope that the Opposition understands the importance of that- but the motion would be carried on the basis that the Opposition has proven its case in the Ermolenko affair and on the basis that we believe the Minister has harmed Australia's national interest to the very serious extent that he should vacate his office.

* I do not believe that there is any warrant for a ballot of this character to be conducted in accordance with the rules of the union as the committee of the union wants it, because we know that there are circumstances in which ballots of unions are not secret, in which there is exercised a degree of intimidation, in which persons would wish that they had an opportunity to exercise a postal ballot which is their own <span class="highlight">vote</span> and not an intimidated <span class="highlight">vote</span>.

* I would have thought that there would be no objection from a Labor Party which believes in compulsory voting in all parliamentary elections and which, I understand, believes in compulsory voting in local government elections and will force people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and fine them if they do not, to the application of that principle to the union movement which in many ways is more powerful in this country than the Government itself.

* I believe that a decision to make a 50 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> compulsory with a penalty of $5 for those who do not <span class="highlight">vote</span>, would be abhorent to the trade union movement.

* Therefore, in my belief it was irrelevant for  Senator Hall  to refer to the fact that the Australian Labor Party supports compulsory voting in elections for parliamentary office and the imposition of a fine on those who do not <span class="highlight">vote</span>, when he suggested that it should be compulsory for members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a trade union ballot for amalgamation.

* Some trade unions are not able to attract the same miserable <span class="highlight">vote</span> as was attracted at the municipal elections in Sydney last Saturday, as  Senator Greenwood  admits; yet he suggests that another 20 per cent should be added to the percentage <span class="highlight">vote</span> in order to make certain that there will be no more amalgamations, that the weaker unions will stay weak and that there will be an imposition on members of those small unions through their having to pay higher contribution fees, knowing that unions cannot function efficiently and effectively when they do not have large memberships.

* That means that they ought to be encouraged to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and to obtain enough information about their unions to know what is to be gained and what is to be lost by an amalgamation; what one union may have in assets and what it may gain in faculties if it amalgamates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* The existing Act provides that half the members of a union must <span class="highlight">vote</span>, which means that just over 25 per cent of the members of a union are required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour for an amalgamation to succeed.

* I understand that the results of the last election for the House of Representatives- this proposed system is to apply to both Houses- showed that the average number of candidates for each electorate was four which meant that an elector had to fill in only three out of the 4 squares to have a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span> because, as we all know but do not tell electors, they do not have to fill in the last square.

* I do not want to labour this particular point, but I do want to suggest that hundreds of thousands of Australians are not in the spectator group of the community and do in fact enjoy playing bowls, cricket, football, golf or whatever, and to these people, I say quite seriously, this is an option that is being taken away from them- the option of coming back after 6 p.m. and having until 8 p.m. to register their votes.

* However, as has been pointed out, there are in this Bill a number of provisions which are party political in the real sense of the term, and nothing epitomises this more than some of the provisions in regard to postal ballots which are quite unashamedly designed, in my opinion, to determine that certain peoplepredominantly voters for the Opposition- will have less opportunity of voting and of using the postal ballot system.

* Be that as it may, the circumstances in which an elector of the division concerned may apply for registration are that normally it is difficult for him to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a polling booth in the State by reason of the distance between his enrolled address and the nearest normally appointed polling place in the division, or the lack of adequate means of transport from his address to the polling place.

* An inference to be drawn from his remarks- I hope I am not doing him an injustice because I admire him too much as a person- is that it is far better to determine the fate of a government by not counting all the votes than determining it by counting all the votes.

* As long as the Government quite rightly compels people to enrol or suffer a penalty and as long as the Parliament compels the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or suffer a penalty- I think that is the proper course of action accepted by all Parties- we should in no circumstances limit the capacity of electors to exercise a <span class="highlight">vote</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43)

* This clause of the Bill also proposes to delete the words 'and that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> contained in the envelope was recorded prior to the close of the poll ' from section 96 of the Act because these words would no longer be necessary in a situation where the <span class="highlight">vote</span> had to be in the hands of the divisional returning officer by the close of the poll.

* Some people might have voted that way deliberately and, if people deliberately <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the top to the bottom of the ballot paper, I think it is a bit of ruddy cheek for members of political parties to say that they are donkeys or that they have cast donkey votes and that they do not know what they are doing.

* Admittedly, under the Government's proposal, whoever is fortunate enough to draw first position will gain the advantage of what is commonly referred to as the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span>; but this is considered to be afairer system than one based on the standard alphabetical system, under which a candidate whose surname happens to commence with the letter 'A', or perhaps the letter 'B will always gain an advantage over a candidate whose surname commences with a letter lower down the alphabet.

* It was for the sole purpose of meeting the situation when an issue was of such particular importance to an individual that he wanted how he voted or how someone else voted recorded that we had the right to call a division and so have a record of voting which could be produced to show the action of each individual in a particular division.

* I went along with the Bill in June, expressing only my opposition but not putting the matter to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but when the Government gets to the stage of taxing waterfront labour in the four or five Tasmanian ports at rates ranging from $4 to $5 per man hour and we realise that the money goes into the cost of Tasmanian exports and imports, I am bound, unless I am sent here to misrepresent Tasmanian exporters and importers, to cast my <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill.

* The plain fact of the matter is that if you ask anybody in the street whether he agrees with the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value you will find that the impression has been conjured up in the minds of the people that this principle means a sort of crushing of the rural <span class="highlight">vote</span> by those with urban thoughts.

* Of course, the members of the ALP do not practise that principle because they know very well that if ever the Federal Executive of the ALP was made up in accordance with the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and on a population basis there would be no Federal organisation as we know it today.

* Of course, that may be the view of honourable senators opposite, it may be the view of  Mr Daly  and it may be attractive to his particular type of sense of humour, but the facts are that this redistribution which  Mr Daly  promotes with such a measure of urgency month after month is a redistribution which would establish in the Australian scene a necessity for a Liberal-National Country Party coalition to achieve 55 per cent of the votes in order to attain government and would enable the Labor Party to achieve government with some 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>.

* Also when we are talking about 10 000 informal votes that were wiped out, we have to consider that scrutineers reported that many informal votes that originally were put out of the ballot were then put back into the ballot. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* When we consider that the final <span class="highlight">vote</span> which elected the last senator, who happened to be myself, showed a majority of 2016, those 10 000 plus votes tend to assume rather critical significance.

* I submit again that if the votes were recounted today the totals would probably be altered because of the near impossible task given to the officials of the Australian Electoral Office in scrutinising the votes of 53 candidates in the Senate election in 1975 and, perhaps even worse, the votes for 73 candidates who stood for New South Wales in 1 974.I think it should be mentioned also that because there was a complete recount there was also a new random sample. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* Again I submit that even if not one additional informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> had been found, if not one wrong <span class="highlight">vote</span> had been found credited to any candidate, the result must have been different because of our system of counting with random sample. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* If we look at the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span> and at those statistics, we find that 22 230 votes drifted directly across to the Liberal Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* But in fact the drift was much more than that because 2302 votes went to the Family Action Movement, 474 went to the Democratic Labor Party and 233 went to the Workers Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* I think one can reliably conclude from this evidence that at least 25 000 of the voters in New South Wales at the last Senate poll were intent on and serious about filling out their ballot paper but saw a lengthy and confusing ballot paper placed in front of them and tried to fill it out as quickly as possible and still comply with the Electoral Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* They did not have any real desire to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Socialist Workers League; they just wanted to fill out that ballot paper. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* As I said, perhaps 25 000 people voted in that way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* But from scrutineers' reports I have received it appears that supporters of both major parties, that is, the LiberalCountry Party and the Australian Labor Party, made serious mistakes on the allocation of preferences on their ballot papers with the result that the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span> was much more than 25 000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0)

* My scrutineers reported that some hundreds, possibly thousands, of people in New South Wales went down the House of Representatives side of the ticket and then went to the Senate side, making their <span class="highlight">vote</span> informal.

* If we were to adopt the one man- one <span class="highlight">vote</span> approach and then wanted to have no more than a 10 per cent variation, what will happen in the Northern Territorythat is all we are talking about at the moment- is that we will have even more electorates than we have now.

* When one starts advocating in this chamber that we just cut out what we want to cut out or increase what we want to increase in this way or that, I think that has to be viewed in the context of the responsibility of the elected government- a responsibility which it must carry- to prepare a Budget which can be rejected and on which the people have a chance to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or which is otherwise relatively unalterable by this chamber, whatever this chamber may think about it.

* I was not going to enter this debate but I think that I ought to if only to remind the chamber,  Senator McLaren  in particular, that this is an important clause and that votes are needed; and when one has a <span class="highlight">vote</span> one keeps it in the bag and does not blow the bag as he has done.

* That is the purpose of this motion: The Opposition is seeking an assurance from this Government that, having been given the power and the obligation to protect the rights of Aborigines, it at least guarantees- if necessary by an Act of the Federal Parliament pre-empting the Western Australian Act, if and when that is passed- the rights of Aborigines to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections in Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0)

* I emphasise that it is part of the general view of the Government that not only Aboriginals but also other disadvantaged people in the community- disadvantaged in the sense that they are less able than others to take advantage of the electoral laws which exist to safeguard their rights to <span class="highlight">vote</span>- should be assisted in regard to this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0)

* In other words, the difficulty in exercising the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is not likely to be the only difficulty that that person faces, whether it is a migrant who is not able to speak or read English, or whether it is an Aboriginal who is not able to speak or perhaps to read or write English.

* If one were to take a strict reading of the motion which was put forward- I do not intend to do that and I have indicated that the Government will support the resolution- it does, subject to the qualifications I am making in this speech, provide that even if we look at Western Australia which has been subjected to so much criticism here today, one will find in fact that there are areas where the Aboriginal voter is advantaged under the State legislation as against the Commonwealth legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0)

* The particular example to which I draw the Senate's attention is that the Commonwealth electoral legislation provides that an application for postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> must be signed by the elector in his own handwriting.

* I am trying to say to honourable senators that we pick up what we believe to be the spirit of the motion, with the vituperation removed, and say: 'Yes, we are very anxious to see that Aboriginals who have some disadvantage are able to <span class="highlight">vote</span>'.

* One finds in that statement, which is recorded in  Hansard,  that not only are we concerned about and mounting these programs with respect to Aborigines but also that we are mounting quite substantial campaigns to ensure that other groups in the community, in particular ethnic groups, get the necessary information which they require to exercise properly their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>.

* I refer very quickly to page 31 of  Mr Justice  Kay's report for his comments on postal votes, which again 1 think are useful in pointing out the differences between the States and the difficulties of ensuring, when a marksman is involved, that one is getting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the person who is claimed to have his name on the electoral roll.

* There is now a resurgence, for reasons I have explained, of confidence in the AUS, such that Monash University, Adelaide University, Griffith University in Queensland, Newcastle University and the Western Australian Institute of Technology all rejected secession motions in September of this year, and Melbourne University, which had previously seceded, returned to affiliation with AUS by a 65 per cent majority <span class="highlight">vote</span>.

* The main substantive change in this particular Bill is the removal of the power of a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the Chief Justice where there is an equality of judges, an evenly divided court, in appeals from the Federal Court, from Territory Supreme Courts, or from the Family Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0)

* Hitherto, in those situations where there has been an equal division of judges, the Chief Justice has had a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>, unlike the situation which has obtained in the State Supreme Courts, where appeals coming from those jurisdictions and resulting in an even division of opinion have resulted in the majority decision at the lower level- the State level- prevailing.
