* I ask the Minister whether there are special considerations which the Government has taken into account and which have led to the apparent delay, and whether such considerations include the need to avoid any embarrassment to members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0)

* As he has said, and as we know, the great British system of justice which he now represents and advocates before the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> was founded mostly upon the illegal actions of those who revolted against tyranny and oppression in the early stages of British history. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-3)

* I repudiate the idea that there would be available magistrates with political party membership, and I would regard it as unthinkable that any charges relating to the matter raised by the honourable senator would come before a member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> who has political party membership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-22-0)

* Another matter to which 1 refer  -  I am not referring to unionists here - is the complete contempt shown for our <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and the powers and functions given to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> by the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

* Once people show an increased and continuing contempt for the institution of Parliament and for the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, I am afraid we will be on the way to anarchy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

* Does anyone suggest for a moment that the men who are appointed to our <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> are subjected to influences from outside sources? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

* Of course, if heads of departments have not operated in accordance with the express intention of the Act, under any Act we have the right to appeal to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> in these terms: 'I have an entitlement for such and such but the Secretary of the Department refused to pay me the entitlement.' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0)

* We cannot complain much when there is an appeal to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and the matter is given judicial consideration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0)

* In the Minister's opinion, would an expression of amazement by a Minister at a judge releasing a defendant on bail be inappropriate and express a lack of confidence in the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-7-0)

* It was argued that the ordinance which was promulgated in 1969 was unfortunate to the extent that it purported to give to practitioners from outside the Territory' a right to be admitted either as a barrister or as a solicitor, lt may well be that that situation was outside the scope of the provisions of section 55d of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0)

* 1 suppose I am speaking from my own experience in these fields, but I would regret the disappearance from the scene of the barrister - the person who is trained in court work - because it would mean that litigants would be less well served and, indeed, the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, which has always been drawn from the Bar in Australia and in British countries, would be the less well equipped to maintain on the bench the qualities which a barrister seeks to develop in the course of his practice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0)

* This accords with Commonwealth policy as expressed in the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act 1903-1969 and the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-64-0)

* The details indicate that the members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> who comprise the Industrial Court have not been occupied for anywhere near the total available time, even on reasonable working standards for the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, in the course of the last 12 months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31)

* There is not really one legal restriction in this legislation which is not justiciable in the courts and that is the British criterion as to whether the individual is finally protected by an independent <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31)

* What the Opposition is in effect saying is that it has no confidence in the magistracy or in the Supreme Court, which are the independent arms of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> emanating from this country as an appropriate place for British justice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31)

* In 1969 we had before this chamber the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Bill by which the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia was increased from 24.000 - a real bread-line salary - to $30,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0)

* The House of Assembly now consists of 84 elected representatives and 10 nominated representatives.- Last July the Prime Minister made a significant' statement in which he- said that legislative authority having been exercised with such credit to the local Assembly, we had come to the conclusionthat the responsibilities and authority of the local Administrator's Executive Council should bc extended and that it should be responsible only to the indigenous elected members of that - Assembly, that it should take sole responsibility for educational matters, public health, tourism, cooperatives, -business advisory services, workers compensation, industrial training, posts and telegraphs and other matters, reserving to Australia responsibility in matters of external security, enforcement of law and order, the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, defence and matters of that sort, I do not wish to repeat the complete statement of the position. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0)

* Did the Federal Attorney-General and several leading members of the Cabinet, together with a leading member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, further discuss this matter later in that year 1963? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0)

* Senator Greenwood  tried to brush that aside easily by saying that no-one served in this way has been imprisoned and that we can rely upon the common sense of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> not to impose a gaol sentence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47)

* Was the case further discussed later that year in Canberra by the Attorney-General, several leading members of the Federal Government and a leading member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>?

* The important aspects of the system we observe are, firstly, that we should have a free and independent <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0)

* The way is still open for gross injustice because the Executive and not the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> will make the final life or death decision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0)

* We have an independent <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and a system of justice which I believe can stand up to scrutiny from anybody anywhere in the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0)

* No one has had the courage to say that there is something wrong with the Victorian <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48)

* We know that juries in England and here have never accepted the proposition that they were bound by the law as stated to them by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-38)

* That is why juries over a long period consistently refused to find men quilty of it and eventually, with the approbation of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and the whole community, they point blank refused to enforce the law because it was a bad law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-38)

* The Crown Solicitor for the Commonwealth is a person recognised by section 50 of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act, and he has a  deputy  in each State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47)

* Was the case further discussed later in 1963 by the then Attorney-General, several leading members of the Federal Government and a leading member of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0)

* Indeed, it would be anomalous if we were to regard the determination of whether or not a person shall be released upon parole as part of the judicial process because it would indicate that there was a judicial scrutiny which was continuing right throughout the period of sentencing, and that I believe would be inimical to the best interests of what the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is called upon to perform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0)

* All that the honourable senator did by making those observations was to indicate to the Senate that he had no idea of the distinction in a democratic society between the Executive and the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0)

* I rest my belief in the broad sense that in a free society, if society is to be truly free - by that I mean the kind of society that has grown up throughout 10 centuries of British tradition, in the creation of the parliamentary system, in the creation of the rule of law, the independent <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and equality before the law - there must remain one principle and that is the upholding of the sanctity of life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0)

* However, 1 have always felt that the imposition of a punishment should be placed in more expert hands than the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0)

* One cannot blame the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> too much because parliaments throughout the ages have felt that the only possible punishment short of death is incarceration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0)

* I ask: Firstly, is the Government aware of the testimony of Yuri Krotkof, given under the name of George Karlin - a high ranking officer of the KGB before his defection in England in 1963 - to the Internal Security SubCommittee of the Committee on the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> of the United States Senate on 6th and 10th November 1969, which was released publicly on 28th December 1970? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0)

* It seems that the Parliament has long lost faith in the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> which has been trained to inflict penalty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#debate-59)

* We take away entirely from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> the normal right of saying what penalty should be imposed under such circumstances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#debate-59)

* by leave - I table a document which is an excerpt from the proceedings of the Internal Security Sub-Committee of the United States of America Senate Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span>.

* Under the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act a matter involving the Constitution or its interpretation may be removed into the High Court at the request of any of the parties or at the request of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of any of the Stales.

* There is also another provision in the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act under which a question which involves the powers, inter se, of the Commonwealth and the States will automatically be referred to the High Court when that issue arises before the court which is hearing the matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-56-0)

* lt is not unknown in this community for members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> to hold shares in great public companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0)

* In regard lo the Australian Capital Territory there is also the problem of the number of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* Obviously the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> needs to be reinforced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* We encourage the Government to take not only the steps which have already been taken but also to take further steps to increase the strength of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and also to bring the law of the Territories into a reasonable state. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* I have noted in respect of some courts - I have no doubt that it applies here in the Australian Capital Territory - that the independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is not as well respected as it might be.

* I do not think the relationship between the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> in this community and the other arms of government is as good as it ought to be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* I think it also has to be taken into account in any consideration of whether there is a field of jurisdiction adequate to maintain, reasonably occupied, a <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> in a superior court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* The point which I wish to make with regard to the independence of judges is that the Government has always accepted that the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is independent and that requests by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> will, in general, always be respected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0)

* In the matter of allowances, the process of determination by the GovernorGeneral dates back as far as 1903 when determination by the Governor-General was incorporated in the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Bill for the travelling expenses of the justices oi '.he High Court.

* If we were following the procedure adopted in the United States, Canada and in other countries we would say to the committee dealing with constitutional and legal affairs: 'You will consider all matters of law and justice, bankruptcy, copyright, the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act, administrative review matters and so on', and then leave the committee to deal with the various aspects which were important. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0)

* I will content myself  with  the statement of the stark facts and I will conclude with the appropriate response to the honourable senator's application because I am not prepared to turn the Senate into a court in substitution for the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-1)

* In relation to the amalgamation which certain people attempted to prevent but which they failed to prevent, our faith was upheld in the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> more than in political Attorneys-General because the court was honest and said that there was no basis for the challenge, and disallowed the challenge.
