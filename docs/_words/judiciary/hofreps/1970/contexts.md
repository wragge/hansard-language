* The honourable gentleman knows that to take advantage of a condolence motion to make reflections of a personal character and upon the professional integrity of a member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is quite misplaced.

* It was put strongly during debate in the legislation committee that a warrant for the use of a listening device in connection with a narcotics investigation should be issued by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and not by the Minister or the Comptroller-General of Customs.

* 
 - Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Bill, the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Amendment Bill 1979, the Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill 1979 and the Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill 1979, as they are related measures.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0)

* There are some people sitting on the sidelines - namely, members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> - waiting to try to show that the draftsman does not know how to draft a Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0)

* 1 think that, if society could get a little more common sense and fewer technicalities from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, we would get on a lot better and the job of the parliamentary draftsman would be made a lot easier. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0)

* Until I have completed my consideration of this major question, it would bc premature to consider tabling the draft amendments of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act that the honourable member hits mentioned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-23)

* Section 10 of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act 1903-1950 states and has stated since 1926, when it was amended - before that there was a similar provision - as follows: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* Under the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act only 2 judges are required to convene a [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0)

* In the 2 minutes remaining at my disposal I intend to refer to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0)

* As Australia grows as an independent nation ... it is essential that there develop a more critical attitude towards the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> as  a  whole and towards Judges in particular cases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0)

* Is there any means by which the honourable gentleman can stay ex cathedra announcements by supposedly learned and responsible members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> such as that reported recently in which culpability for a soldiers strangulation of a defenceless woman was laid partly at the door of the Army? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0)

* In the United States of America there are signs of a much more flexible policy; a sub-committee of the United States Senate <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Committee headed by  Senator Edward  Kennedy has proposed a definition of conscientious objection to include selective objection to a particular war. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0)

* The need for legislation such as this arises out of what can only be described as the legal complexities of our legal system which result from the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the High Court and the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act, and which have produced a dual system of laws creating Federal jurisdictions over some matters and areas and State jurisdictions over other matters and areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-34-0)

* One man's meat, as they say, is another man's poison, a fact now recognised by the American <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, which must rule with wearisome frequency on obscenity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0)

* Since Nelson's day Malta has developed institutions- executive, parliament and <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> - during the same years and in the same form as We have developed such institutions.

* 1 would suggest that if similar actions were taken relative to the High Court or any other judicial body in the community the Minister concerned would be very seriously reprimanded by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and other people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0)

* Several prominent citizens, including members of the clergy and the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, took part in establishing a completely new movement to demand justice for pensioners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0)

* That case did not solve anything because the more thinking people in the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> of the United States said it was a bad law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0)

* The second principle is the independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0)

* That was the result of a constitutional guarantee, but it happened in a state where the philosophy is that the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is an arm of the executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0)

* The real safeguards for citizens of this country are the principle of equality before the law and the independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0)

* I ask the Prime Minister further: Is he aware that in South Africa there is practically 100 per  cent freedom of the Press and religion, that passports for departure from the country are freely available, that there is a fair <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and that there are other signs of democratic freedom? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0)

* Can the Minister indicate how the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> can be made to realise that much stronger sentences should be given in order to discourage dope pedlars of this type? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0)

* Whilst we have the principle of absolute equality of citizens before the law - with everyone, no matter what his station, subject to the law - whilst we have the independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and whilst we have the right of freedom of speech and assembly so long as the freedoms of other people are not infringed, the rights of individual citizens are protected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0)

* A <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, with judges wearing wigs, was imposed on them - it was not their idea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0)

* It means that if that were the law of this country, it would be an end to the impartiality of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, it would be an end to judges' independence and it would be an end to the freedom which they now have to reach decisions based on the evidence and on the arguments that are put before them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0)

* I am sure that the House will understand that an appropriate person to chair the inquiry, coming from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, would not be available at a moment's notice or even at short notice and that the terms of reference would have to be the subject of considerable discussion and consideration both by the department concerned and the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-12-0)

* The Minister said that the reason for the delay had been difficulty in getting an appropriate  chairman  from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> to conduct the inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0)

* If the Government wants someone from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, someone of the calibre of  Mr Justice  Kerr who is conducting the inquiry into Service pay and conditions, then obviously it may have to wait months or even years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Minister made it clear that the Government wanted someone from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0)

* Unless there is some certainty that a senior person from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is available pretty quickly, the Government should reconsider its attitude because it is causing unnecessary delay in this important inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0)

* It seems pointless for the Government to be looking for someone from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> when a select parliamentary committee could be chaired by the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who has impressive legal qualifications and who is familiar with these problems from the days when he was Minister for the Navy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0)

* Of course there are circumstances where an inquiry by a senior member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is appropriate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0)

* Also - this is not of the same importance but is related to it - what has happened to the committee which also was appointed by Attorney-General Bowen in October 1968 to review the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act and. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0)

* I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask what has happened to the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Superior Court and what has happened to the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act Committee which was appointed, pursuant to that proposal, at the same time as the Committee whose report has just been presented was appointed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0)

* I am aware that it is possible that this may cut costs of litigation but in many cases it would cut out a good deal of justice because in litigation, and particularly in defamation actions, as I have found from personal experience, juries are more human and understanding than the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0)

* It seems to me that in the Australian Capital Territory, and elsewhere in Australia, we should preserve the right of every individual to go before a jury in preference to having his case dealt with by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0)

* The <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> may deal with the appeal and the matters of law but, as a layman, I will always advocate and stand by the jury system as such, even though in many cases the costs may be greater. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0)

* I suppose one could argue that the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is not without its costly errors of judgment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0)

* So even the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is not without its mistakes, and this can affect the cost of litigation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0)

* I have not mentioned any member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> by name. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31)

* Mrs Justice  Wiratmo visited Australia from 5th July to 26th July to exchange views with Australian jurists and officials, particularly about social welfare legislation, juvenile courts and systems of appointment to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-44-2)

* While quite obviously the law as it stands must be observed by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> there are available discretionary powers such as the imposition of a bond as a deterrent to repetition of the offence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0)

* I suggest to him that the reason is simple: It is not that the judges are idiots; it is not that the judges - the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> - are insensitive to the problem, nor are they unsympathetic to what the Minister is trying to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0)

* quite frankly, I could not divorce from my thoughts my opposition to or my hatreds, as the case may be, of honourable members opposite if I were promoted to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> tomorrow. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-19)

* But we should remember that this is the place where laws are made and if the law has been found to be inadequate to accommodate the idealism of the Government then all we need to do is to make new laws so that  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Blackburn or any other distinguished gentlemen from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> will uphold the law which this Government enacts to give effect to its desires. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2)

* Of course, the Government is not averse to appearing before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to coerce the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> there into denying the trade union movement of Australia what is its just economic due.

* Under this Government we find that for the salaries of top public servants, the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and conciliation commissioners the sky is the limit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21)

* It is almost time that we called a halt to the huge salaries being paid to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, to the top public servants and to other sections of society, and gave more to the people who really need it, such as those on $52 a week and others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21)

* I want to refer to and commend an article by  Mr T.

* If the legal process is to retain the confidence of the nation, the extent to which the High Court exercises its undoubted power not to adhere to a previous decision to its own must be consonant with the consensus of opinion of the public, of the elected legislature and of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> as to the proper balance between the respective roles of the legislature and of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> as law makers.

* It may be influenced by the federal or unitary nature of the constitution and whether it is written or unwritten, by the legislative procedure in Parliament, by the ease with which parliamentary time can be found to effect amendments in the law which concern only a small minority of citizens, by the extent to which Parliament has been in the habit of intervening to reverse judicial decisions by legislation; but most of all by the underlying political philosophy of the particular nation as to the appropriate limits of the lawmaking function of a non-elected <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>.

* In this context I also question the costs of establishing a very considerable family court infrastructure, in view of the limited number of appropriately qualified persons from the bar, especially in the case of New South Wales, could cause a relative fall in the standard of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> with the result that the very people- the litigants whom this Bill is supposed to help- will probably have to incur increased costs in their search for a satisfactory divorce settlement.

* One can question whether the Government 's original intention to plan and provide means of communication between the States has not been surpassed and bypassed by a Bill which has as its ultimate objective the complete throttling of the finances of the States' service responsibilities and the harnessing of these to control by a body outside the scope of the Parliament, the Executive and the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>.

* Let me make this point: The Attorney-General then has power under the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act- the relevant section is 71 A- to file a prosecution whether or not there has been a preliminary inquiry for an indictable offence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0)

* On that basis, the Attorney-General should give serious consideration to whether he should file an indictment under section 71A of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0)

* I would like to endorse the view expressed by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that it is extremely important that published copies of all legislation be readily and cheaply available in an up-to-date form not only to the legal profession, to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, to public servants and to students, but also to individual people who may have particular problems which require reference to legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0)

* It has been accepted for decades among the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, the law officers of the Crown and the legal profession that the High Court of Australia ought to be relieved of much of its original jurisdiction and some of its appellate jurisdiction.

* The result, today, is that one person out of every four in Australia is employed in the public sector, in various forms, such as public service, education, railways, electricity supply, health services, airlines, banking, insurance, telecommunications, broadcasting, housing commissions, CSIRO, public works, not to mention police forces, the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, courts and the armed forces.

* The more one thinks about it- of course, he stressed the fact that this has not anything to do with publicity- the more one feels the desirability of courts basically being open so that people can go in, see what is going on and feel a certain confidence in the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>.

* I do not want to deal with individual cases but, with the greatest respect, I thought that under our constitutional system, including the conventions under the Constitution, the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> was independent.

* It is totally at variance with the independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> which has been sustained and supported over many years of constitutional endeavour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0)

* It might be noted that this provision for appeal to the High Court is more restricted than the provision for appeal from State Supreme Courts under the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Amendment Bill now before the House.

* To try to make political capital out of matters which are presently before the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is, of course, in keeping with the total lack of knowledge of the constitutional independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> of this country which honourable members opposite display.

* Nevertheless, the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act amendment does indicate that there are to be major restrictions in matters of appeal which may be now brought as of right to the High Court from any State supreme courts and other State courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-38-0)

* We are advised generally that at the present time section 38a of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act has the effect that only the High Court may decide questions as to the limits  inter se  of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of the States, and that present section 40a provides for automatic removal to the High Court of cases commenced in other courts which raise such a question.

* Clause 10 of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Amendment Bill proposes to create a new power for the Commonwealth or a State Attorney-General to intervene in any case between private parties pending in any Federal court, any Territory court and any State court exercising Federal jurisdiction if the case involves a matter arising under or the interpretation of the Constitution.

* With respect to the new rights of legal practitioners, clause 8 of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Amendment Bill proposes the insertion of a new section to confer a new right on legal practitioners who are now entitled to practise in Federal courts to practise in any court of any State in a case where that court is exercising Federal jurisdiction.

* I make it quite clear that I am not opposing the new Federal Court of Australia but rather I am endeavouring to tear away the wraps of mystery which surround our <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and facilitate the payment of salaries far in excess of the salaries of the nation's parliamentarians and more significantly way ahead of the nation's Ministers.

* Yet when we look at the salaries paid to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and compare them with the salaries paid to parliamentarians the figures are not so close. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18)

* I ask you,  Mr Deputy  Speaker: Does this indicate to you that perhaps the Ministry- whether it be a Labor Ministry or a Liberal Ministry- is being grossly underpaid or that perhaps the nation's <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is being grossly overpaid? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18)

* If anyone suggested for a moment that a man in has late eighties was not quite as able as a much younger man to produce a judgment, that person would face a great deal of problems for having made such a suggestion against a member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18)

* I also believe that it is high time the Government of the day either reviewed the salary ranges of the Ministers to bring them up to the level of those of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> or, alternatively, ensured that the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> has its salaries pegged until such time as the Ministry- the men in whose hands we have entrusted the future of this nation- are paid the same salaries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18)

* If I may say so with respect to him, it was an unfortunate attack because the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, of course, cannot protect itself from such attacks, which have been traditional in the Parliament over the years since Federation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18)

* But the superior courts, by and large, consist of a small number of judges compared to the figure of 500 or 600 members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> mentioned by the honourable member for Griffith. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-18)

* To some extent I have sympathy with him but when this question was discussed by the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act Review Committee as far back as 1969 the problem quickly arose of finding another basis.

* I would like to thank all those who have participated in this debate for the constructive way in which they have dealt with the matters raised in these important and significant Bills which in effect are reforming the Federal <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> in this country.

* I might make the point that in another debate earlier today it was suggested that the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and magistrates may not work as hard as politicians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-38)

* I suggest that is the wrong atmosphere to create and will not assist either the Parliament or the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-38)

* Clause 1 1 ensures that State courts shall have jurisdiction with respect to these offences in accordance with the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act 1903, but, except in the case of trials on indictment for offences committed in a State which, by section 80 of the Constitution, must be heard in the State where the offence is committed, this clause permits the State courts to exercise jurisdiction without regard to the limitations imposed by the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act as to locality of the offence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-22-0)

* He also disagreed with the view of McTiernan J. that section 78 only provides a rule of practice and as such is subject to the power conferred on the Justices of the High Court by section 86 of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act to make rules of court regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-56-1)

* Having regard to the decision of the High Court in the case referred to, it must be taken that, as a matter of law, section 78 of the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act does not confer on an applicant for special leave to appeal to the High Court a right to be present personally in the Court and to argue his case on the application for special leave. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-56-1)

* Whether section 78 should be amended in any respect is a matter that will be considered by the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act Review Committee now examining the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act and the Committee will report to me on this matter in due course.

* I now hear the absurd proposition being put that members of the National Parliament are required to sign chits every time they use a Commonwealth car but that members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> need not do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22)

* More importantly, however, it will help to secure the independence of the federal <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, notwithstanding the existence of a procedure for fixing retiring ages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* Of course many people over that age can still have full possession of their mental faculties, but the incredible record of longevity of members of the Federal <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> read out by the Leader of the Opposition indicates that normally on retirement members of the High Court and other Federal courts have been considerably older than people in other professions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* Without meaning any disrespect to elderly members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, many of whom are distinguished and have had a most outstanding career in the law, I believe that younger judges are closer to the people and that younger judges can offer much more to a growing and developing country such as Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27)

* Let me say briefly, in conclusion, that the Government believed that, in accepting the spirit of the amendments which we moved in the legislation committee and which sought to shift the authority from the Minister to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, we were giving effect to the wishes of this Parliament and probably to a large section of the community that feel that every possible precaution should be taken.

* However, because they carry out functions that are very much analogous to those of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and because they carry out important matters of conciliation and arbitration and lay down rules which bind- at least we hope that they bind- those parties to the various disputes, I believe that there is for the purposes of considering separation of powers no real distinction between their position and that of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>.

* The point I want to make is that I do not believe that on matters of substantive law as against procedural matters there ought to be any consultations or discussions between any of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> or commissioners and members of the legislature or the Executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is up to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> or the Commission to take the laws as they are amended and to interpret them in accordance with their office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0)

* I do not believe that the Executive should seek to contact the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> or the Commission in respect of substantive laws and tell them what it believes should be an approach to those laws.

* The High Court of Australia Bill and the associated amendments to the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act and the Evidence Act together represent a legislative scheme for effecting the transfer to the seat of government of the third arm of government established under the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act 1903, which provided for a High Court consisting of a Chief Justice and two other justices, included the provision:   on and after a date to be fixed by Proclamation the principal seat of the High Court shall be at the seat of Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0)

* In other respects the Bill makes little change to the existing provisions now found in the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act and the High Court Procedure Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0)

* Incorporated in this Bill are all the provisions dealing with the constitution and seat of the Court and administrative matters relating to the Court now to be found in the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act and the High Court Procedure Act.

* As indicated in the observations I made in connection with the High Court of Australia Bill, the primary purpose of this Bill is to transfer from the <span class="highlight">Judiciary</span> Act the existing provisions dealing with the constitution and seat of the Court, its registries, places of sitting and the like and to incorporate the procedural provisions formerly found in the High Court Procedure Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0)

* On the part of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> in particular, it is dependent upon separation, upon independence and upon impartiality, and particularly impartiality. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* Only if the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is known to be unbiased will the system continue to function. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* There are a number of related topics, including the subjects of making political appointments to the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and the use of judges for nonjudicial functions to which, whilst topical, I do not intend on this occasion to address myself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* What I do intend to discuss is the standard of conduct required of members of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, if they are to avoid the appearance of bias towards one or other party and the legislature is to have confidence in the doctrine of separate power for the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, which this legislation is about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* The winning of independence by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is generally accepted to have occurred when the Act of Settlement of 1702 altered the tenure of judges. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* In the Australian Constitution, the provision in section 72 that a judge's honorarium may not be diminished during his term of office may be seen as an additional protection of that independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* Another rule designed to protect the independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is the protection from legal process for acts done by judges in their judicial capacity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* Thus, the fact that under the Australian Constitution the High Court may be asked to determine the constitutional validity of legislation passed by Parliament does not mean that the High Court will be usurping the role of Parliament or that Parliament is less independent or separated from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* Nor does the passage of legislation such as the Administrative Decisions (Judical Review) Act 1977, whereby Parliament decided that Executive decisions may be scrutinised by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, mean that the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> will usurp the role of the Executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* Such matters as these, in my view, do not detract from the independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* These matters having been examined briefly, independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> means two things. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* The <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> must be free from any practical constraints or pressures imposed by other branches so that it can fulfil its functions without fear of reprisal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* The traditional view ofthe gaining of independence by the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> supports this functional approach even if historically the developments were based on functions which were less clearly defined and even if other factors were also involved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* The other aspect of this functional approach is that if the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> is to be independent in carrying out its functions, the other branches must be free to do the same without interference from the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> until the time for judicial activity as envisaged by the law arises. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* The making of public statements concerning matters on which other branches are engaged must therefore be avoided if the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>'s own independence is to be respected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* The discussion of independence from the Executive and Parliament may suggest that these are the only threats to judicial independence and that public confidence can be maintained where the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> engages in political activity or public comment as long as the activity is seen to be a sign of independence from the government of the day.

* The <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> has tenure beyond the term of any government so that partisan activity against a government will lead to a belief that the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> will favour the views of an incoming government from the other side. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* One fairly recent event when the role of a member of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> in dealing with the actions of the other branches of the government has been criticised was the advice given to  Sir John  Kerr by  Sir Garfield  Barwick about the dismissal of  Mr Whitlam.

* The independence of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> and the respect which is accorded to it in the community is not intended for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> but for the benefit of the public.

* Any loss of independence on the part of the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span> will lead to a corresponding loss of respect in the community and the ultimate failure of our legal system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0)

* I have watched the <span class="highlight">judiciary</span>, whether it be the Supreme Court of New South Wales or the High Court of Australia, treating the law as if it was a piece of elastic, determining the course of the precedents and stretching the law to suit its interpretation which suited their own personal view.
