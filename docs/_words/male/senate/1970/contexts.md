* But today it has been revealed to me that somebody in Canberra in an office, not in Parliament, not so far as I can learn even with ministerial approval and not so far as I can learn with Government confirmation, has devised a scheme whereby, if a partnership is exporting a crop, the view is taken in this edict from the office that the shares of the <span class="highlight">male</span> partners who actively participate in the orcharding activities are to be proportionate to their shareholding.

* I have said over and over again, as  Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Social Security, has said that this Government's policy is to phase out the means test in the lifetime of the Parliament, assuming that the Parliament runs for 3 years, of course, and to increase pension rates until they are equal to at least 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings.
