* I simply re-emphasise those words used by the Prime Minister in his policy speech- that the schools commission to be created by a Labor government would include persons familiar with and <span class="highlight">representative</span> of- I wish to underline the words '<span class="highlight">representative</span> of- the State departments, the Catholic system and the teaching profession. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* What the Opposition sees is a desirability that there should not be simply an hierarchy leading up to a few who make the ultimate decisions but rather that there should be a sufficient number which is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the various interest groups, although not answerable to those interest groups, throughout the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* I therefore made the point that the Government not only had a mandate but also had indicated, as shown in the passage from its policy speech that  Senator Rae  drew attention to, that it would put on the Schools Commission 'people familiar with and <span class="highlight">representative</span> of State education departments, the catholic system and the teaching profession'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* The points which I wish to make are, firstly, that there was a mandate; secondly, that there was a specific undertaking by the Government to make <span class="highlight">representative</span> categories; and, thirdly, that the various parent and school organisations made representations to the Karmel Committee, to the Prime Minister and to ourselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* It is our view that if every group represented on the Commission were required to do the same, the result would be a Commission properly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the education community, but free enough from sectional pressures to be able to function was an expert objective body. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* The Council's letter also said that if every group did the same- that is, if every group represented on the Commission were required to nominate a panel from which the Government would choose one person- the result would be a properly constituted and properly <span class="highlight">representative</span> Schools Commission.

* I was making was that to be bound to this inflexible system which the amendment moved by the Opposition seeks to impose on the Government is to lay ourselves open to having representatives, in this direct sense, of various organisations that may cease to be <span class="highlight">representative</span> in any true sense if there is a hiving off of some of the most im portant elements in the organisation such as we see in the case which I have quoted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* The argument between us, really, is whether the Commission should be what we seek to make it, which is a flexible body reflecting as widely as possible the views of people across the education spectrum but not consisting of representatives, in the literal sense, of people who represent pressure groups. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* But the Opposition by its amendment seeks an inflexible directly <span class="highlight">representative</span> body which, I suggest, is undesirable from many points of view, among them being that it limits the opportunity for the Government of the day to choose the best people who are offering. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* But after examining the list of the Committee people whose names I have read out it is very difficult to find any support for  Senator Carrick  's argument that we had conceded the Opposition's point because, in fact, we had a committee that was almost entirely <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the categories which he had asked should be represented. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* The Minister would also have the right to select 2 teachers from a panel of five submitted by the body which I am sure is generally accepted as being <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Government primary and secondary school teachers- the Australian Teachers Federation.

* In using the word '<span class="highlight">representative</span>' what we have accepted- we have had many discussions about this and I am sure that other honourable senators have also had many discussions about this- is that bodies such as ACSSO- the Australian Council of State School Organisationsthe 3 New South Wales federations which have expressed their views to us on many occasions, the Victorian Federation of State School Mothers Clubs and various other organisations all of which I could refer to in detail are keen to have what they call representation of parents and teachers on the Australian Schools Commission.

* One point I want to make is that perhaps all of us have been neglectful for not seeing that the promise made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his policy speech has been carried out because provision has not been made in the structure of the Schools Commission to include a direct <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the taxpayers.

* After I battled, as a unionist, for 19.5 years to get the right for teachers to be represented by their own people on government education bodies, I now find teachers coming to me and saying that they do not want to appoint their representatives; they would like the Government to appoint people for them'.

* In a way this is an historic occasion in the Senate because we have heard enunciated a new democratic principle which seems to be that a government should not appoint commissions without making them directly <span class="highlight">representative</span>, by nomination, of the various groups which will be affected by their decisions.

* I link this matter with that which is being debated by the Senate on the basis that the Opposition, whilst maintaining an attitude of hostility towards  Senator Hall,  reflected in its opposition to his being a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of this chamber at the Constitutional Convention, nevertheless seeks to embrace within its own ranks a person who has masqueraded for far too long as an Independent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0)

* Despite what the Opposition said, it was obviously endeavouring to exclude  Senator Hall  as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of this Senate at the Constitutional Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0)

* I drew a distinction between the Opposition's attitude in that respect, that is, to  Senator Hall  as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a political group that could be fairly said to be independent of both the Government and the Liberal-Country Party Opposition, and the Opposition's attitude in embracing a person with the record of masquerading that  Senator Townley  has acquired over the years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0)

* If the Opposition is touchy about this matter, and since  Senator Townley  has not seen fit to be present in the chamber during any of the time that this matter has been under debate, I will not labour the matter any further except to say that I am convinced that the majority of Tasmanian electors are quite certain that they have as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> in Canberra in  Senator Townley  a person who flies under false colours.

* So it is in government, where an Upper House acts as a brake on hasty legislation, imposes a period of reflection and provides an opportunity for anyone- the farmer, the banker, the industrialist, the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of labour- to voice his opinion, support or protest regarding proposed legislation, after which the Upper House may make or suggest amendments to proposed laws.

* We have reached the stage where the compression to five Ministers in this chamber ought, I think, to excite this chamber to take into serious consideration the principle whereby the business of the Senate would be advantaged if all the Ministers who are responsible for Executive government were in the House of Representatives and the managers, who would be of equal status to the Ministers and would have the responsibility of managing the business of the Senate, were in a confidential relationship with the Ministry, but occupied that degree of independence which the Constitution requires all senators to occupy.
