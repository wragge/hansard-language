* Finally, the third body that attracts  Mr Justice  Hope's explicit attention, at page 48 of the report in question, is the CPA(M/L), the China-line communist party which recently, of course, found itself split into two rather bitterly-opposed factions, with its barely 1,000 members divided between those who pledge undying loyalty to the Gang of Four and the Cultural <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> and those- the larger group- who support the current more pragmatically-inclined Chinese leadership.
