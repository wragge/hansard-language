* When  Senator Wheeldon  tries to equate the votes of Singapore and Malaysia in the United Nations to the fact that they really do not fear <span class="highlight">subversion</span> inspired from the People's Republic of China, I wish to say to him only that perhaps he should go and speak to the leaders of the countries of South East Asia - and go with his ears open, his eyes open and his mind open - because he will find that each of those countries expressed grave concern at the continued <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, the continued terrorism being practised in their territory by Communist terrorists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0)

* Gallup Polls have shown that the community wants its standards upheld against the advocates of porn and moral <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, whose propaganda undermines the roots of ordered freedom by the pollution of the people, and those in power would do well to give more heed to real public opinion than to mass media writers who do not reflect it.

* For the purposes of this clause the activities which can be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversion</span> constitute in a sense an offence against this seciton; that is to say, they constitute an activity and the inclusion of the word 'ultimately' in sub-clause (a) of clause 5(1) really adds nothing to the definition or precision of what is meant by activities which will lead, in the end, to the use of force or violence or other unlawful acts.

* In  Mr Justice  Hope's recommendations with respect to the domestic aspects of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, without spelling them out here in detail, it was clear that the concept of force or violence as an element in the notion of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>- the concept of overthrowing the constitutional government, of unlawfulness in the activity involved or contemplated by the persons in question- was the basic flavour that emerges from his definition.

* I was pointing out that if one reads the whole of clause 5 it becomes quite clear, since the important criteria to be used in determining whether acts of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> have taken place concern the use of 'force or violence or other unlawful acts' for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the constitutional government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory', that those editorial allegations were nonsensical.

* We are talking about a definition of '<span class="highlight">subversion</span>' which, if satisfied, will bring into play the operation of some quite extraordinary, far-reaching and very dangerous powers; powers to tap telephones, install listening devices, open mail, intercept telegrams and enter and search premises. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* For the purposes of this Act, the activities of persons, other than activies of foreign origin or activities directed against a foreign government, that are to be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversion</span> are- (a) activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence or other unlawful acts (whether by those persons or by others) for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the constitutional government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.

* I would go so far as to say that if this provision is to be given its face value,  Senator Hamer  's speech in this chamber just a couple of weeks ago, in which he revealed in an extremely lucid and penetrating way just what a ramshackle structure Australia's Defence Force has and that in a way that must have given considerable comfort to those people, perhaps overseas, who are interested in hearing such an analysis and in taking such a viewpoint- is that kind of attack on the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen),  on the Army, on the Defence Force, which represents a paradigm of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* In fact,  Mr Justice  Hope recommended that the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> should include the activities of persons directed to- I quote his words- 'obstructing, hindering or interfering with the taking of measures by the Commonwealth Government in the interests of the security of Australia'.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* It is our view that this clause should contain no reference to hostility or hatred being promoted between different groups in the Australian community as being one of the criteria of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, this enabling the various powers contained in this legislation to be exercised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49)

* Given those sorts of passions, given those sorts of tensions and given the speeches and statements by all sorts of people right across the political spectrum that could surely be described as going to promote hatred or bitterness of a deep and intense kind between different political groups in the Australian community, is not that an illustration of the kind of thing which could be characterised as <span class="highlight">subversion</span>?
