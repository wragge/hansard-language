* I believe that we need to remove the word 'ultimately' from paragraph (a) of subclause (1) of clause 5 because, as I said at the outset, it would at least put some pressure back on to ASIO to be more careful when it handles, when it deals with and when it acts under all the inferences contained in this rather wide-ranging definition of the word '<span class="highlight">subversion</span>'.

* What is troubling about this dragnet definition of the word <span class="highlight">subversion</span>' and what makes it different from the definition of 'arson', 'theft', 'rape' or any other kind of offence is that all those offences have an objective element in them.

* Clause 5 ( 1 ) (a), in dealing with the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> when not of foreign origin', reads:  activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence .

* 
 - Mr Chairman, with respect, what I am trying to show is that, if we are talking about the word 'ultimately' and what these facts will ultimately lead to, it is obvious that they will ultimately lead to a threat of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> or a threat to security.

* That is why, during the late 1960s and early 1970s we had the spectacle of ASIO agents placing under surveillance people who marched in anti-Vietnam demonstrations- clergymen, academics and trade union leaders- because in their judgment those actions were ultimately bound to lead to threats against security and constituted <span class="highlight">subversion</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36)

* We are defining subversive so the community will know what these organisations are about and what we believe constitutes <span class="highlight">subversion</span> so that these organisations can be monitored and our community and our Government will be informed through the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation being able to do that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36)

* The word 'ultimately' in this context is designed to give the organisation the capacity to be able to monitor those activities, whether the organisation wishes to hide its objective, whether it wants to try to put it aside in some surreptitious way, or whether it wants to indicate in an open way that it preaches <span class="highlight">subversion</span>.

* I think that for the purpose of this argument you would agree that the words of preamble in clause 5(1) have to be read concurrently with clause 5(l)(a)- We have been given no specific example of the kind of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which might legitimately be regarded as being within ASIO's field.

* If one were to have a DirectorGeneral who was a man of small '1' liberal approaches, and he looked at this section on what falls within the definition of subversionand <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is what we are talking aboutbecause the act has to involve or lead to an unlawful act- he could rule that the act of marching was an unlawful act.

* I take the viewand I believe many small '1' liberals would agree with me- that the act of marching by a citizen who wants to protest against a State government which says that he cannot march without a permit, is not the kind of political or social action which ought to attract the operation or the attention of security forces in order to prescribe that citizen as being involved in a possible act of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>.
