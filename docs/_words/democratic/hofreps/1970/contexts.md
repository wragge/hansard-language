* Within the limits of this speech, the foregoing is an over simplified exposition naturally, but it is at the practical root, I believe, of the Government's disinclination to impose target dates, and that accounts for its policy - which is correct, in my view, on both philosophical and pragmatic grounds - to expedite development throughout the Territory so that, when the people determine for home rule, there will be, first, some prospect of a national outlook; secondly, some prospect for cohesion against secession movements - there are at least 4 active in Bougainville, the Gazelle, the Highlands and Papua - and personal ambitions for leadership, but perhaps they can form together a federation; and, thirdly, some prospects of government under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system rather than relapse into army or political dictatorship under some strong man, a few of whom can be seen today striving mightily with the cry.

* The laws have not always been easy or pleasant laws for many of the people to accept but the Australian community has shown a responsibility towards the maintenance of the rule of law over the last 100 years, a record of respect for laws democratically arrived at I would say there is no better record to be found in the world than the record we have.

* I have seen in the year that is behind us many moves which could be interpreted in that way - moves which on the surface seem fair and reasonable and attractive enough but when they are put together into a pattern seem to move towards this funda mental Government objective of destroying the Australian States, destroying every other form of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government and centralising everything here in Canberra in one House of Parliament so that the man who obtained the Prime Ministership by some quirk or chance of fate will be able to perpetuate his power, be able to over-ride everything in the Constitution and have complete control of the whole Australian economy, social structure, family life and everything else that one can imagine.

* Members of the ethnic community- this would be the case with the rest of Australia if subjected to a similar experienceresent the efforts by the Government to try to condition them to accept political propaganda which is slanted in a way that tends to favour the Government and they resent the enormous dilution of essential facts which should become commonplace information through any public broadcast or television service in a free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society.

* The emotionalism which has been associated with so much of the objection to constructive critics in the past in my view has been couched out of concern to protect our security agency from any sort of criticism rather than a genuine concern about establishing or maintaining the minimal level of secrecy consistent with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the community and, on the other hand, an appropriately effective functioning of a security service.

* The point again is that that puts in an extremely subjective judgment, because the word 'ultimately' might mean 100 years, 150 years or 200 years, and that could lead to such an extraordinarily cautious or repressive view being taken of what is legitimate or illegitimate behaviour that we will find ASIO's powers being extended in a way which I think is quite objectionable in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> community like ours.
