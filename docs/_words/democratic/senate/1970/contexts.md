* But the Moratorium Campaign is an attempt to substitute the impact of the mob as one finds it obstructing people in the street, as one finds it opposing people's passage with force and, on occasion, generating force, and by that means substituting the chance mass assembly of 1,000 or more people in a crowd for the organised expression of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> people in Parliament.

* Firstly, because of the proliferation of legislation - I understand this is one of the heaviest, legislative programmes that the Parliament has ever seen - every one of those Bills has to be studied by one or another member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-31-0)

* In the present period of excessive legislation we must sit longer hours and the Leader of the Government has suggested a conference with the Leader of the Opposition and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party.

* I was also very interested to hear representatives of both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party claim that if those parties were not the authors of the legislation at least it was their idea.

* What the Australian Government has said is that if people wish to demonstrate in order to express their dissent, all that the Government asks of them - and I say this in the light of the full responsibility I hold - is that they do so within the processes of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedures.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#debate-43)

* However, I think it is reasonably properly regarded as the way in which the Opposition has been bringing up matters rather than using other devices.I have expressed the view also that a reasonable opportunity should be made within the allotted time for the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and for the Independent,  Senator Turnbull,  if he so wishes, to bring up matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#debate-43)

* I think the status of the draftsman ar Parliamentary Counsel is being enhanced by this Bill, but if it is to be further enhanced one can envisage a time when what 1 believe is a desirable state of affairs will have been obtained; that is when people enter into a study of the law for the purpose of becoming draftsmen and not any other purpose; for the purpose of writing laws, not to become advocates, solicitors or even judges for that matter, but giving their lives and their skills to the preparation of legislation which is an essential part of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government.

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has grave doubts that this matter of CommonwealthStates financial arrangements can be left any longer to a straight-out negotiation between the States and the Commonwealth unless all the best political brains in the country are urged to think about the problems and try to solve them.

* Because of the situation which has developed the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is of the opinion that the stage in thinking has been reached where honourable senators should be reminded that before they represent the various political parties in this chamber, or anybody else, they should represent the States from which they have come and they should protect their own States from this very thing which has happened in the course of the development of Commonwealth-State financial relations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0)

*  As I said in the course of my remarks, I do not think that all the best brains of this country are in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labour Party, I do not think that they are all in the Australian Labor Party and I think there is plenty of evidence to indicate that they are not all in the Government, otherwise we would not be discussing this proposition tonight.

* In rising to give my views on the motion which has been moved on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party by  Senator Little,  I cannot but preface my remarks by saying what a coincidence it is that in the Chair at the moment is  Senator Wood,  a man who is so well-versed in the problems of local government finance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0)

* As is normal for the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party,  Senator Little  emphasised his non-Party political approach to this subject, in the hope that this approach would continue.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0)

* I do not propose at this early stage in the debate to move an amendment to the motion but I do suggest to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and to the Senate on the completely non-party political basis on which this was introduced that the idea that I have put forward be given serious consideration before the debate ends with the idea of an amendment coming forward. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0)

* I suppose that one could say that the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States is an extremely important matter, one that is causing a great deal of concern throughout this country at the present time and one that has to be resolved before too long if the institution of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in this country is to survive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0)

* I have cantered across the field for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and to correct the mistakes made by  Senator Devitt  who is away restoring himself, 1 hope, after the long speech that he made, lt is perfectly true that the States find themselves in financial difficulties, as they found themselves in 1929. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0)

* If there is any legislator who cannot bring himself to the degree of conviction as to his undivided loyally to the armed forces which the <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, freely elected Government of this country compels in part and organises in another part to engage in that conflict - if there is any legislator who cannot bring himself to the degree of conviction that his duty is to support them, he is wanting then those elemental human qualities of judgment and character which alone can create the defence of this country.

* He will discredit his opponents in order to get that job which  Senator Anderson  now occupies and which he tried unsuccessfully to obtain today only to find that even the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party left the Senate in order to avoid the disagreeable duty of having to vote for something for which  Senator Greenwood  was responsible.

* I was pleased to see  Senator Greenwood  given the opportunity to make a personal explanation and I would like to compliment  Senator Murphy  for his <span class="highlight">democratic</span> approach and at the same time condemn  Senator Georges  for his undemocratic approach in again denying freedom of speech.

* Concern was felt by many honourable senators on this side of the chamber as well as  Senator Greenwood,  and also by members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, that violence might erupt, and it was thought that the people of Australia should have this fact pointed out to them, lt was thought that particularly those participating in the demonstration should be told that they must exercise complete restraint to make sure that people and property would not be endangered or damaged in any way.

* My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate could almost, by coincidence, be supplementary to that asked of him by the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, fs it not correct and traditional procedure that motions for dissent from a ruling be given precedence over the normal business of the Senate?

* The amendment which I propose to the request made by the Minister for an amendment to the Bill is in line with the amendment which ( moved to the motion for the second reading, which the Minister would not accept, which the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party did not support and which went to a division on which it was defeated.

* I will give  Senator Devitt  an explanation concerning the repayment period, because it is quite clear to me now that the Australian Labor Party has always been a long way behind in understanding what the credit unions want and, in effect, what the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has been proposing.

* Perhaps if there were a different government, if the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Lahor Party were in government, we might add to the Government's intentions, we might broaden them, but the present Government is the Government of the day, and its purpose under this legislation is, first of all, to encourage people to save.

* It is true that we in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party would have perhaps gone further and proposed a reduction of the amount of the prescribed housing loan to less than $5,000, but if we did that, as a matter of practical politics we would get into the category of the Australian Labor Party which in another place moved an amendment which was virtually along the line which  Senator Georges  is suggesting, that is, to make this legislation apply to every credit union, however small it might be.

* We have given these people every encouragement throughout the political history of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and, indeed, much of the original cooperative housing legislation was introduced as a result of the efforts of the people who today form the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party.

* It is obvious not only that the Government is unappreciative of what the credit union movement is and how it operates but also that  Senator Little  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is unappreciative because if he were a member of a credit union and he was interviewing someone about a loan of this type the last thing he would advise the person to do would be to borrow over a period of 1 2 years.

* Apparently the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party senators agree with us on that, but they say that the other benefits ofthe scheme are not worth delaying for the purpose of achieving this principle.

* We have had 20 years of Liberal Government in this country, and in those 20 years we have been told repeatedly - and possibly the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party would also take this view - that it is only the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government that really knows anything about the defence of this country, that it is only this Government which is competent to make decisions on what ought to be done about defence and that any other person of another political colour who suggests that the Government's policies might be wrong is obviously misguided.

* That motion, which was put forward by  Senator Little  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, suggests that a joint select committee be appointed to discuss the whole matter of the raising of revenue so that both the Commonwealth and the States will be able to discharge their functions properly.

* Following that situation the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has argued that the amendment proposed by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is not acceptable for a variety of reasons which the Labor Party itself included in the amendment to the motion for the second reading that has been carried by the Senate.

* The whole thinking of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is that whether our propositions are correct does not depend merely on assessing the condition of one industry, but on really assessing the condition of that industry in relation to the whole rural sector, the tariff and taxation policies of Australia, and all those other things which influence the economy of any part of Australian life.

* He may believe that the problems in the European Economic Community, to which  Dr Mansholt  referred, and  Dr Mansholt's  suggestion that a complete review of agriculture was needed in that part of the world, are appropriate to the Australian position and in line with the royal commission proposed by  Senator McManus  on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party.

* 1 said earlier that my Party would not dissent from the proposition stated in the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party which calls for a National Health Insurance Commission financed from graduated contributions because for a long time the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party's policy has been for a comprehensive national insurance policy on a contributory basis to cover sickness, accident, unemployment, death of a breadwinner, and old age.

* Although I believe that the amendment moved by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is one that could bring action, I plead with members of that Party not to force the issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* I, and other members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party did not intend, because of the importance of this legislation and the desirability of its principles being considered, to speak specifically to the principles of the Bill which  Senator McManus  adequately covered but, as I say, a situation has developed which makes it important that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party should be heard at this stage of the debate.

 Senator McManus, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, welcomed the Bill in that it marked a substantial advance in the provision of health and medical benefits and treatment for the Australian public. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* The proposal of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is that in view of the fact that there is still a difference of opinion in branches of the medical profession, between general practitioners and the other branches of the profession, this legislation should be delayed until the holding of a most significant meeting which the Australian Medical Association has convened in a last endeavour to reconcile the varying views and which could well result in a common proposal finally emerging for consideration by the Government and for incorporation in the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* That is only about 10 or 12 days from the present time, and I, and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, can see no reason why this legislation should not be held over until that most important meeting is held.

* Does it concede the right - not only the right, but the responsibility - of the 4 members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, whose vote may be decisive, to examine all these amendments in detail? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* We would support such a proposal, and at least in that respect we would expect the cooperation of the Australian Labor Party if for no other purpose than that its own amendments could be considered adequately, not only by members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party but also by all members of the Senate who have not as yet had the opportunity to consider them in detail. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* Firstly, I wish to deal with the appeal of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to the Senate to withhold the passage of this legislation until such time as the result of the meeting of the Australian Medical Association on 2nd and 3rd June is known. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* 1 hope that the Committee of the whole - the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Country Party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the independent senator - will look at these amendments with a completely objective view to see whether this Bill cannot be amended further and improved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* We acknowledge that and we do not want to see the Bill delayed, so I suggest to the Senate that it reject the amendment which has been moved by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and write in the general principle by supporting our amendment.

* I want to speak much more fully to the amendment moved by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party but in these last 2 minutes I want to stress that I believe that in this Bill we have legislation which is of the utmost benefit to the people of Australia, legislation which is carrying out one more promise made by the Prime Minister during the last election campaign.

* T suppose all members of the Parliament would be quite happy if social service benefits could be organised in such a way that they did not have to be debated in the Parliament, but I believe that it is wishful thinking on the part of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to put up a suggestion which there is no prospect of any responsible government ever accepting.

* However, as the interest of the people at large as well as that of a section of the Parliament had been aroused and an opinion on the matter had been expressed by the Senate, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is of the opinion that the Government should not have moved for the removal of the ban without at least obtaining a much clearer opinion from the industry itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0)

* To support a resolution which claims that the Government is in contemptuous disregard of Parliament just because it does not follow the viewpoint of the Senate in which the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party can determine - because it must always win a vote - which will be the point of view, is not in my opinion to the merit of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party nor does it aid any concept of responsible administration.

* Already on 1 occasion the Senate has voted to oppose the lifting of the ban, and on another occasion when only members of the Opposition and members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party had participated in the debate and had spoken in support of the ban, the matter was not taken to a vote but the indications were that if it had been the members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Parly would have voted with the Australian Labor Party and we would have had a sufficient number of votes to establish our view. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0)

* I believe that the Senate has been treated contemptuously in that an opinion reached by it democratically and after full debate, namely, that a referendum be taken of those involved in the industry to learn their wishes, has been ignored by the Government.

* Let it be clear that if any arrangement was made that this matter would be proceeded with, to my knowledge the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party was not a party to such an arrangement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* Anderson - no charge can be levelled against the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party because we were not aware of the arrangement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* We are concerned at the charge made by  Senator Murphy  that in some way the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has all along sought to sabotage the formation and operation of the committee system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* But more importantly, no party has participated personally through its members in the functioning of committees of all kinds to a greater degree than has the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* If one looks at the committees set out on the notice paper one will find that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is represented on almost every committee of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* Therefore, to say that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Parly has in any way attempted to sabotage the committee system is to make a spurious charge, one that is quite untenable and one which is resisted and resented by the party which sits in this part of the chamber. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* Therefore the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party had informed both the Government and the Opposition as to the course of action it proposed to take. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has taken this stand in pursuance of a consistent attitude which has been taken by the Party in relation to committees since they were first mooted in this chamber. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* I think that an examination of the whole proposal shows that there is validity in  Senator Murphy's  claim that the suggested adjournment is simply another way of staving off a vote of the Senate on the point and another adjournment moved by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party could be consistent with opposition to the committee system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* Surely to God if there is a need for an inquiry into housing the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is obliged to agree to that inquiry and should not seek to defer it on the ground that it is concerned about the amount that the Treasury may be obliged to vote for the operations of a committee selected to conduct that inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* As  to  the arguments put forward  by  Senator Byrne  on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span>  Labor  Party, I repeat that it is my view that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is endeavouring to sabotage the committee system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0)

* The facts are that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party opposed proposals for select committees which were clearly in the national interest, such as the proposal for a select committee to inquire into the establishment of a national disaster organisation, the most important proposal to have an inquiry into the needs of education throughout Australia and also, and perhaps most importantly, the proposals  for the  establishment of these standing committees about which we are speaking.

* I would  be  very surprised il, when  we  come to decide on  the  report of the  President  about the operation of the committee system and on what should be done in the future, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party does not support some proposal aimed  at  not establishing the  5  committees but at reducing them to a mere token of one or two and thus prevent the Senate from effectively carrying  out  its intention that 7 should  be  established.

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party expects its propositions, particularly this proposition, to be taken into consideration by the Government when it is considering Australia's financial future, as expressed in the annual statement of accounts, and it will look forward with keen anticipation to whether the Government will be finally able to discover some solicitude for this area of want and drastic need in the community because, as I have already said, these people have nobody to speak for them.

* When we consider the various proposals which  Senator Byrne  said, with some pride, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has brought forward as matters of urgency and attempt to assess the cost of all that has been proposed, we find that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party would have absolutely no money left to give to another area where it is urging constantly that more money should be spent, namely, the area of defence.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0)

* If honourable senators were to refer to the circulated copy of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party's proposed amendment they would find that, under the heading of rural producers costs, it takes into account the Australian tariff, Government policies and other factors tending to raise costs in Australia, the incidence of railway freight on rural producers in comparison with urban charges, road transport and the wage structure of the rural economy.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0)

* They would be terrified by the consequences of their own action, and they are relying on the sense of responsibility of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to destroy an amendment that they do not really want to be carried.

* While the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party supports these Bills we do join in that chorus of concern which at the moment perhaps is not altogether completely warranted in any serious way, but we always urge upon the Government that it should have constantly within its vision the necessity of keeping the strongest and clearest possible scrutiny over foreign investment in and control of Australian companies.

* For those types of organisations that excel in executive government, this is a very good way of pushing things under the carpet without public scrutiny, ft is significant that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is supporting this motion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2)

* This happens every time that the gag has to be applied and the Government has not the numbers, I am aware of only one or two occasions on which the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has opposed the gagging of a debate.

* Many senators would regard some of these matters on the notice paper as vastly more important than the matter that  Senator Gair,  supported by the 4 additional members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, might raise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2)

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party's amendment to the Australian Labor Party's proposal is simply to delete 2 sections of it and likewise the Government will oppose the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party's amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0)

* It is also a matter about which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has spoken on every occasion it has had an opportunity to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0)

* That is the reason why the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has advocated since its inception the establishment of an independent tribunal of competent people who would have regard to the rise in wages and prices and every other criteria associated with the question to consider the matter with a desire and a view to making a reasonable and just determination insofar as pensions are concerned.

* However, that is the position, and  Senator Murphy  has recognised the reasons for it and has very graciously said: 'We will accept the amendment of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to eliminate paragraphs (4) and (6) from the amendment moved by  Senator Brown  originally.'

* But I think that another principle is contained in the proposition that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has put before the Senate today and on which we seek an expression of the Senate's opinion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1)

* Members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party have persevered with this suggestion over the years and have used the term, which they used tonight, that the matter should be taken out of politics and placed into what I recall being referred to some years ago when we first debated this matter as a sort of arbitration court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1)

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has used the analogy that the Government does not fix wages, that this matter is put out to a separate body, and that in that pattern the question of pensions should be put to a separate body which I imagine would be an arbitration court type of body.

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party moved an amendment, and we accepted it to try to get something through and to record some sort of expression from the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1)

* But 1 should have thought that had clause 6 of our amendment been allowed to stand there would have been a better chance of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party having the type of body that it proposes at least examined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1)

* If an independent tribunal were to say that  a  pensioner should receive $40 a week instead of the $17.25 a week which this Budget provides, plus the fringe benefits and supplementary allowances, would the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party say that just because an independent tribunal, with pensioner representation, had so determined, that must be accepted by the Government?

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* Whatever might be the attitude of the ALP, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party will not abandon its support for this proposal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* However, it is only a matter of time before this will happen because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, for one, has informed the  President  already of its nominees in respect of those standing committees to which members have not yet been appointed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* I am interested in the foreshadowing of a further amendment by the Austrlaian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party which has adopted almost the same type of tactic that has been followed in the past when we have dealt with Bills relating to post and telegraph charges. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* But 1 think that a few points should be brought to the attention of honourable senators so that they may appreciate the Opposition's position, and to illustrate the way in which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party., while endeavouring to make its points, has supported the Government and has not supported the Australian Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* lt would take too long to trace through ali the situations which have developed over the years with regard to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party's support of the Government and its opposition to the Australian Labor Party, and the occasions when it has supported us against the Government.

* It will be appreciated that in moving this amendment the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party was agreeing to the Bill being read a second time; all that it wanted was the addition of a pious resolution at the end of the motion 'That the Bill be now read a second time'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* Honourable senators will note that the motion proposed by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party would not, if carried, have defeated the motion "That the Bill be now read a second time': it was proposed to add words to that motion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* 1 think I should bring to the attention of honourable senators that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, and particularly  Senator Gair,  campaigned in Queensland during the last Senate election campaign and made as a particular point their opposition to increased post and telegraph charges, but when the issue came down to a vote they did not oppose the increase. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* It is very clear that the basis of the amendment proposed by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is the tactic used by a DLP senator on a previous occasion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0)

* It distresses me to think that when a senator has been appointed to the high office of Executive Councillor - a very high office in this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country of ours - there should be some denigration or attempted denigration from the Opposition.

* That is why the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, which I am privileged to lead, for as long as it is here, is intent on alerting and prodding the Government - irrespective of which party is in government - about the necessity of having adequate defence.

* The Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party senators and the other Government senators opposed it as strongly as they could because they were conditioned to the old system and any change was to be opposed.

* I hope that  Senator Murphy  has not prejudiced my judgment on this issue, but, being human, I tend to be suspicious about some of his arguments because he has misrepresented the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party towards the appointment of committees, and he has done so merely to win a point tonight.

* But we have sent troops to South Vietnam for that purpose, and we see now what it means: A virtual dictatorship by President Thieu and the clique around him- When I say that I am quoting not Communist sources - the National Liberation Front, Moscow Radio or the Peking Review - but none other than General Minh and, even more significantly I suggest, Air Vice-Marshal Ky who is so <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and so committed to the Western way of life that on more than one occasion he has expressed his most warm admiration for the former chancellor of Germany, Herr Hitler.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0)

* My proposal on that occasion could not be proceeded with because at that time the Government and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, in discussing the formation of other select committees, said that there were not enough staff, resources or facilities to set up those committees.

* That is why I have risen to  express  my g cat regret that the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Senate, when the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party requests the Senate to give its thank, to the armed Services, does nothing but attempt to involve the armed Service:-, in politics.

* But at least, apparently, we have unanimity of economic thinking on the part of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and one of the hardpressed Premiers because the Victorian Premier was honest enough to say that if the Government could get the interest rate back to 5 per cent - and it was the Government which deliberately promoted its increase beyond that point - many of the problems flowing from this aspect would be solved and this would make a major contribution to the alleviation of the other problems in the Australian economy today.

* In view of the fact that the minimum wage has increased by $19 a week and the unemployment benefits for a man, his wife and one child have increased by only $7.25 a week, we members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party suggest that, if there i to be any increase at all - or even if there is not to be any increase - in the numbers of genuinely unemployed people who want to work and who are desirous of keeping themselves and not becoming a drain on the community, that increase of $7.25 a week over the last 10 years should be looked at very seriously by the Government.

* Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is that while initially we did support the propositions that mostly came from the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Murphy)  requiring amendments to be made to Bills as they were introduced, finally a point came when we took a stand that this sporadic approach to these matters was not a good one, that it was only a casual one which meant that merely because a Bill relating to a principal Act happened to come before the chamber the matter was dealt with in relation to that officer and no others.

* Indeed, if I remember correctly,  Senator Byrne  said that if the Opposition were proposing the establishment of a body which would have a broad charter to investigate the ramifications of the Public Service in this particular year and then, in 7 years time, recharter that body to conduct a further investigation, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party would have no objejction to such a proposal.

* On the one hand, we have the Associated Chambers of Commerce pressing for years for an inquiry into the management, efficiency and structure of the Commonwealth Public Service; the trade union movement has been pressing for such an inquiry; on ils own admission the Government slates that an inquiry is warranted; the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party believes that it would support an independent inquiry, although not a parliamentary inquiry; and the Labor movement which seeks an inquiry is the only body which has come forward wilh a constructive suggestion as to the type of inquiry.

* The Leader of the Government is not here, and we believe that he ought to be involved because the whole of the business of the Senate is a matter of comity between the Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and, where they are involved, the Independents.

* This proposal was rejected by both the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the Government on the grounds, firstly, that the suggestion was far too wide to be handled by a committee of this sort and, secondly, that there were not enough bodies to go around; in other words, that the Senate's committees were so cluttered up that we would be unable to do justice to the motion that I moved on Tuesday.

* Above all, we must not step in on this ad hoc method which the Australian Labor Party has long enunciated and which unfortunately the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party now seems to support, for it does not have regard to the fact that irreparable harm may be done to our development if we frighten away overseas investment in this country.

* From the other side of the chamber - from the Australian Labor Party - on a matter which should be completely nonpolitical we have heard nothing but an intemperate attack on the good will, the good faith and the integrity of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in bringing forward this matter.

* When this matter was first raised and started to be a matter of public concern and when it attracted the attention of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party certain economic conditions were prevailing which, while they gave rise to concern that the present position might develop, were not of the acute nature which is now so apparent and so evident.

* I know that it has been suggested that it is very difficult to take action in this area, but a few years ago the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in Queensland at a State conference put forward the suggestion that there should be a gradation in scales of company tax so that as a public company had more or less Australian participating equity, so the rate of company tax should vary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0)

* I suggest that much of the dissension and many of the problems that have forced the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to try to bring on debates in this chamber on CommonwealthState financial relationships would not have eventuated if the Commonwealth had dropped this pose of Santa Claus when meeting the normal everyday commitments that it has to meet.

* I am pleased to know that  Senator Murphy  and  Senator Byrne  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party have indicated that they will propose that further discussion of this matter be adjourned until 25th May, because frankly I personally will not be satisfied if the Government appoints an interdepartmental committee or a committee of its own choice to inquire into poverty and that inquiry is to sit in confidence or in camera. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0)

* I rose not to say such things and indeed not to oppose the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party's proposed amendment, but rather to say that in my view any solutions whatsoever to the problem of poverty cannot be made at the level of government alone, whether it is local government, State government or Commonwealth government.

* So much was I taken by this story told by honourable senators opposite that I got the impression that Queensland senators on the other side of the chamber really have gone over to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party.

* Nothing can be more damaging to the fabric of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, of a properly conducted State, than to have laws which are openly defied, laws which a very substantial section of the community believe should not be applied and which in fact are nol applied.

* That showed that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, following the increase in its numbers in this place, was inclined to the fallacious view previously held by the Australian Labor Party, that the raising of matters of urgency would win support and win elections.

* Now we have reached the stage where the Government is using this matter to show a solidarity in its organisation, a solidarity in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, and divisions in the Labor Party because the Labor Party is the only honest group which votes according to its conscience.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0)

* The Labor Party says that it will let those people vote for the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party but it will make their votes ineffective in the final analysis by having the first past the post system.

* We hope that this chamber, with the wisdom which it always displays and for which it has shown much more aptitude in recent weeks, will follow the lead of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and vote for the amendment which it has moved to the Bill which is before the Senate.

* I am quite sure that  Senator Little  will accord with that view because his Party, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, is represented  in the Senate whereas although the percentage of votes it gains at each election would normally entitle it to some representation in the House of Representatives if that chamber were a truly representative assembly, it has no representation there. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0)

* For those reasons, I feel that the case which the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has made in support of its amendment is not a case which will make our representative democracy work in the effective way that it must work to maintain its public acceptance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0)

* But I believe in compulsory voting because I believe the most important function in any democracy is for people to exercise the duty of determining which of the opposing parties they prefer as the party by which they should be governed, I think it makes, theoretically or philosophically, for a sounder base for our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system than any of the systems under which there is voluntary voting.

*  I rise to support the amendment moved by  Senator O'Byrne  because in the view of the Opposition it follows logically from the debate in this chamber on 27th September which I am sure prompted the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to put its notice of motion on the notice paper and to have it debated today.

* I point out first that, in my opinion, the point taken by  Senator Webster  is correct and that the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party contains a far better proposition than that embodied by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in its motion.

* Although the honourable senator's criticism of the Government may be valid and justified, I submit with respect that he has to make up his mind whether he intends to support the motion proposed by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party or the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party.

* I assure the Australian Labor Party that if at any future time it is prepared to bring forward a constructive proposition in relation to this matter it will unhesitatingly obtain the support of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, lt has been suggested that this project which has caused all the flurry will lead to a contest of strength between employers and employees to the detriment of the country.

* 1 listened with a great deal of interest to the observations made by  Senator Byrne  on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party when he committed his Party to a line which is opposed to acceptance of the proposition which  Senator Negus  has put to the Senate today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52)

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party seems to be saying that it is either all or nothing; that unless the Government abolishes death duties in toto the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party will not do anything whatever to improve the position of people who are suffering from death duties as imposed at the present time, even if there is hardship.

* Apparently  Senator Byrne,  on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, does not share all the reservations of the Minister for Civil Aviation on this matter because  Senator Byrne  conceded that the amendment moved by  Senator Negus  is in fact an ameliorative proposition; that it would make the position better for people who are faced with sudden payment of death duties and who are suffering hardship, whatever the definition of hardship ultimately may be.

* I am saying that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party will give consideration at that time to the arguments placed before it and that at this second reading stage, while we are supporting the Bill, we too have many reservations about particular areas which seem to be covered by the proposed amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0)

* However much we welcome these appointments, we on this side of the chamber think, certainly in respect of the new posts which have been created in various spheres in the Commonwealth and in respect of other principal offices of the Commonwealth which may fall vacant, that it would not be consonant with the proper operation of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process if those posts and vacancies were to be filled subsequent to the dissolution of the House of Representatives and prior to the coming into being of a new government, whatever its political complexion may be.

* We of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party appreciate that the Bill is the result of agreement between the States and the Commonwealth and that any deviation from it would probably lead to a renegotiation with the States before anything could be done.

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party offers to the Government these ideas: Would it not be logical for the Commonwealth Government, if it is prepared to foot the bill of some millions of dollars to help the fruit growers - it is not the 60m that the Commonwealth puts aside in respect of wheat or wool or anything like that, and that is a very contentious matter with the fruit growers - to provide a sum of money to enable them to get the necessary information and advice as to whether and, if so, where and how there are possibilities for the growing of even the limited range of fruits which I, as an ordinary individual, can walk around the market places of Asia and observe the people buying and enjoying and which I know are the most popular fruits?

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has never been so disappointed with a piece of legislation as it has been with this Bill, ft has never seen a piece of legislation that it has felt would be so ineffective in achieving the objective it set out to achieve - that is, of getting rid of some trees of a particular character in areas of over production - than this Bill.

* I remind him that one of the reasons we are not selling some of our primary products, including fruit, in some parts of Asia is the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to the cold war, American policy, the 'all the way with LBJ' policy, and its backing to the hilt of this Government's policy on Vietnam.

* by leave - As to the relative merits of invest ing the State courts with additional jurisdiction as the alternative to the establishment of a second Commonwealth Superior Court, I would not say that my Party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, has a very definitive policy in this field. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0)

* I have watched these appointments over the years and it has interested me that as far as I know none of the many friends and supporters of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the trade union movement has ever obtained an appointment to one of these positions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* So I can only say that no person who has ever been associated with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, in spite of the considerable number of trade unionists who have been associated with it, has ever been appointed to one of these positions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* He has said today that a man who has sympathies with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is not eligible for appointment as a commissioner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* Mr Brown  is not a member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party but the Australian Labor Party suspects that he sympathises with the DLP and so, because of his dangerous thoughts, they say he is not eligible to be appointed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* Secondly, irrespective of whether people within the trade union spectrum give allegiance to the Communist Party or the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party - I do not say this offensively, but they are a splinter segment of the trade union movement - as far as I am concerned and I am sure as far as  Senator McAuliffe  and his colleagues in Queenstend are concerned, they should be entitled to appointment provided they are physically fit to the job. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* But if a man is hopping around on  2  or  3  jobs and if he reaches a stage where he becomes a victim of hallucinations and can see communists or <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party supporters under his bed he cannot be said to have the objectivity that is required to do this job. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

*  May I intervene shortly to indicate that our attitude on this side of the House is quite clear, that in matters such as the appointment of conciliation commissioners there should be no discrimination on any ground, whether it be of religion or politics, and the mere fact that somebody had been a member of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party does not disqualify him from appointment to office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

*  I am open to correction but my understanding is that at some time he had been a member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

*  I have listened closely to this debate but I am somewhat puzzled because I have heard allegations concerning membership of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party of people who, as far as I am aware, are not members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* When he was faced with a decision of conscience and decided that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party was right, he stood 4-square with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* I do not know whether he is trying to say that there was something wrong with the appointment, that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party appointed  Mr Saker  or something like that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* We in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party have always been prepared to dish it out, but we take it and we take it without squealing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* I trust that in the interests of labour relations in this country the appointees will carry out their duties as well as members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party who have been appointed to similar positions have carried out their duties in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* The suggestion is that the man who has all those qualifications got the job only because, while he was not a member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, it was suspected that he might have been sympathetic to the DLP. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* I think it is regrettable that members of the Australian Labor Party have attacked his appointment and said that he was a member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* I therefore owe it to his memory to say that he was never a member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, because he said he was a member of 'the' Labor Party, and in his view there could only be one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38)

* I rise merely to indicate that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party welcomes the presentation of this measure and supports the principles contained therein. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0)

* Government has lost in the community, lt is interesting to note that some 11 days before the Prime Minister made his first statement on this matter in the House of Representatives, which was on Tuesday, 19th September .1972, we received in the Parliamentary Library a copy of 'Focus' which is the official journal of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party.

* If one examines the presentations of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in many fields over recent years it will not be by accident that one will see that we have sought to have national investigations of many important matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0)

* 1 repeat that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party welcomes the move to alleviate the problems for those 2 cities, but I would sound a note of warning for the State of Queensland, that the allocation and the diversion of national financial resources to the alleviation of these 2 great urban problems must not be allowed to obscure the situation in Queensland where there may be a problem not of the same intensity but where nevertheless there are regional cities and towns which await their own future development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0)

* This is why the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has been consistently concerned at the persistent refusal to examine the problem in depth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0)

* With those few words I indicate that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party supports the Bill and opposes the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0)

* But the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is on the march and its membership is growing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0)

* So, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party does not accept the first amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0)

* I do not believe that someone should go to gaol for being a member of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party; but that does not mean that I am advocating membership of the DLP.

* Irrespective of whether it is the Government's fault or not that this mess has occurred which prevents the Leader of the Country Party from having his election policy speech broadcast in metropolitan areas, surely the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process ought to permit him to do this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0)

* Alternatively, will the Government consider the possibility of introducing into this place legislation which will operate from a period prior to the commencement of the general election with the understanding from all sides that such legislation would be enacted in both Houses, if required, after the elections and that it would have retrospective effect in order that we may find a common sense approach and permit the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process to operate as it should? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0)

* Because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is a smaller Party, we members of it must perhaps accept responsibility for more departments in our activities than do members of other Parties.

* I believe that the amendments reflect the wishes of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the vast majority of unions, particularly the views of the Federated Clerks Union which the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party says is affiliated with its organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0)

*  in reply  -  1 thank the Opposition and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party for their indications that once again measures introduced by the Government in the field of Commonwealth employees compensation will have the endorsement of the Senate.

* We are not silly enough to believe that at this stage that, with the objections raised by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, our amendments will be carried. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35)

* The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party over a long period sustained interest in this matter and finally moved for a select committee of this chamber to investigate the whole matter of foreign ownership and control of Australian resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-38-0)

* So, with those few observations, I indicate that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party supports the Bill and does not find itself in a position to support the amendment moved by  Senator Murphy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-38-0)

* For those reasons and without unduly wishing to delay the Senate at this late hour of its deliberations the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party supports the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0)

* 
 Senator BYRNE (Queensland - <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party) - by leave - I was a party to a general arrangement in relation to the Bill proposed by  Senator Murphy  and the Prices Limitation Bill, listed as Order of the Day No. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0)

* We of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party do not think that the time is propitious for a Bill of the immense proportions of  Senator Murphy's  Commonwealth Electoral Bill to be taken to a resolution at the second reading stage, particularly in view of the amendments to be moved at the Committee stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0)

* The Government, together with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, has resisted every attempt to bring this Bill on for discussion and to have it decided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0)

* Day after day I have moved that the Bill be brought on for decision and each day that move has been rejected, again by the votes of Government supporters and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, including honourable senators who claim outside this chamber that they are in favour of the vote being given to 18-year-olds but who come in here and do everything they can to frustrate it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0)

* But the Government, particularly some honourable senators on the Government side, aided by members of the DLP, is determined to ensure that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is not carried out entirely. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0)

* Well, I think that reveals that those on the Government side and members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labour Party, including those who are protesting that they are in favour of the vote for 18-year-olds, will do everything they can to prevent 18-year olds being given the vote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* The first one of note is that the Bill seeks to enlarge the objects of the Act by adding to section 2 of the principal Act proposed paragraph (f), which states:  to encourage the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of organisations so registered and the fullest participation by members of such an organisation in the affairs of the organisation.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* In a way this is an historic occasion in the Senate because we have heard enunciated a new <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle which seems to be that a government should not appoint commissions without making them directly representative, by nomination, of the various groups which will be affected by their decisions.

* This body of senators which has now discovered this new <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle that all commissions must be chosen from people nominated from various groups did not see fit to adopt that principle when it was setting up the body which is nearest in its functions to the one we are talking about today.

* Despite all the claims that have been made by the Opposition, particularly the Liberal Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, that they are moving these amendments in an earnest wish to see the Commission work we, the Government, see the results of the amendments if carried as a complete emasculation of the Schools Commission Bill, as a restriction in ambit on the part of the Minister's making appointments to the Commission and indeed, if not deliberately calculated to restrict and inhibit the Commission in its workings, certainly they could result in people, brilliantly qualified to contribute to such a commission, not being able to be appointed to the Commission.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* Because this is the first of his amendments which deal specifically with the functions of the Commission and because the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has indicated that it supports the Opposition on this amendment, it is my intention to call for a division on this amendment.

* But knowing that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has joined the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party so that if the Opposition amendment were put to a vote it would be successful, I merely lodge my objection on behalf of the Government to the amendment proposed by  Senator Rae. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* Having said that, I say that the Government strongly opposes the proposition put forward by  Senator Rae  on behalf of the Opposition; but, again, bearing in mind the vote that was taken on the last amendment and what is indicated as the attitude being adopted by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party we will not unnecessarily take up the time of the Committee by dividing.

* We of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party feel that in all circumstances opposition is warranted and therefore we support the stand which has been expressed by the honourable senator. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* The Government cannot accept the proposition put forward by  Senator Rae  and which obviously now has the support of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party because this proposal of the Government, and the opposition to it by  Senator Rae,  relate to the very structure of the Commission, a matter which we debated at length last week and again yesterday. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* It is, in the Committee's opinion, more in accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle and the developments since Federation that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one half of the number of States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* The Committee's proposal would not disturb the Federal fabric of the Constitution, inherent in section 128, but its proposal would serve to lay more emphasis on Constitutional change by the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of majority vote than there at present exists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* I believe that this change will bring the constitutional provisions more into accord with the spirit of the founders in 1901; more into accord with today's mood of national awareness; and more into accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles and processes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* We believe that the 2 changes to section 128 of the Constitution contained in this Bill will put referendums on a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis and make it more possible for the Constitution to reflect more accurately, in contemporary terms, the spirit and the fact of Australia as one united nation.

* I do not want to transgress by referring to what is contained in that Bill, but I simply say what a lot of humbug it is because for 23 years under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government we did not need such legislation; for 23 years there was no call for it.

* If public submissions are sought from interested bodies, I would indicate at this stage that if the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is invited to make a submission and if it is appropriate to do it or if in response to a request we are permitted to do so, we will make a submission to this body on the need for adequate child endowment as one of the most practical, one of the easiest and one of the most justifiable ways of assisting young families in the community.

* If one studies the results of the recent British election and if one keeps in mind the very clear enunciation of principle only a few days ago from the Government sponsoring this Bill in the Senate- the Government said it would fight to install a 2-party system of government in this country because it is the only proper way to get an efficient government- one sees the clash between the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> ideals which the Government has placed in the name of the Bill and the Government's intentions.

* Yet a party which sets out to obtain a 2-party system of politics, irrespective of the number of people who may want to support other parties, is prepared to come forward with an ambiguous sort of proposal which does not in itself mean anything or does not lay down what is to be the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system.

* What purpose is to be served by placing before the people a referendum which merely enunciates that election shall be by a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of voting, when the system is not spelt out so that the people can judge for themselves whether the ideal which is contained in the name of the Bill will be attained?

* I suppose the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> form of election is the proportional representation system which ensures that the representation in the parliament will reflect completely the will of all the people who are entitled to vote and which will give the minorities as well as the majorities the right to have voices in the parliament.

* Over the years the State governments have changed, and have changed more rapidly than the Australian Government, which shows clearly that the system is sufficiently <span class="highlight">democratic</span> to allow for the  changings  of government and to allow for the emergence of new political thought in the form of minority groups, some of which will unquestionably some day become majority groups, just as the Labour Party emerged in the political history of England from a party which struggled for many years before it won one seat in the House of Commons.

* I had reached a stage in my address on the previous occasion that was virtually a preamble to the statement I have just made, but if my remarks have been misinterpreted as suggesting that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party may have some sympathy with the Bill, I point out to the Senate that certainly members of my Party have sympathy with the title of the Bill and with some of the principles that are supposed to be enunciated in it.

* I hope that everybody who supports the Labor Party and everybody who supports democracy will have a look at Federation Insurance Ltd and see that it is the type of organisation which, no doubt while it pays money to people who prate about democracy and freedom of speech, is prepared to deny a man and his family their livelihood because the man belongs to a legal political organisation and wishes to exercise his <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights as a candidate for Parliament.

* But we do say this- and we say it without any fear of contradictionthat the donations that have been made to the Australian Labor Party by any large financial institution, whether it is the Myer Emporium or anybody else, are infinitesimal when compared with the donations that have been made to the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the National Alliance.

* I appreciate that this is an extraordinary kind of operation, but the attitude appears to be that this office of strategy and election tactics was justified in the last election when it nobbled an eminent ecclesiastic and that it is justified by its organisation of libel cases against the propaganda of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party at election times.

* Following the statement made to the Senate last night by the Leader of the Opposition that if the Government did not jump he would push, can the Leader of the Government say whether  Senator Withers  has now advised him that  Senator Withers  does not have the numbers to reject the Appropriation Bills because South Australian Liberal senators now realise that a double dissolution will ensure the election of  Mr Steele  Hall to the Senate and so enable him to set up a power base for the purple Liberal movement on a national basis as was done by the late  Senator Cole  in 1955 in regard to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party?

* I think it is perfectly reasonable for me and other members of the Opposition to place a very sinister interpretation on what the Government has done by developing amendments at the very moment when all unions, particularly the NCC dominated unions, would have had to transfer to the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> method of electing officials; that is, the rank and file method.

* In summary, I and other members of the Opposition, are opposing this legislation because it removes the right of the rank and file members of unions to participate directly in ballots for their full time Federal officers because it enables minority factions at present in control of some unions to retain control of those unions against the wishes of the rank and file members, because the legislation was drawn up without proper consultation with the union movement, and because particularly the 15 per cent amendment was introduced with no consultation and is an erosion of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the trade union movement.

* What right has this Parliament to impose upon the trade union movement a method of self-government which is contrary to the traditions of the organisation, to its industrial coverage and to its administrative convenience, when those organisations must have rules that uphold the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of their officers and their committees by the membership as determined and established by court precedent over many years?

* The Government, after very anxious consideration of various methods by the Minister whom I represent in this chamber, has decided that a one-tier collegiate system of voting for the full time officers, leaders of trade unions, whether they be at the Federal level or at the branch level would be an effective method, an equally <span class="highlight">democratic</span> method, of electing such leaders. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* I felt that  Senator Ryan  misunderstood the nature of the collegiate system because she seemed to think that it was undemocratic and contradictory to the Government's policy of requiring postal ballots which it introduced into this legislation earlier this year.

* So I think it must be clear now even to those Labor senators who seem determined to misunderstand or misrepresent the nature of this Bill which seeks to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that this Bill simply provides an alternative <span class="highlight">democratic</span> method of electing the leadership of trade unions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* We are simply giving the trade movement the choice of adopting, through its own <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes, controlled by the general restraints and guidelines of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and its regulations, a direct voting system for their leadership or a one-tier collegiate voting system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* It seems to be a logic that is related to the fact that, having been through an election in which the centralism and federalism concepts were major problems and major elements for discussion and determination by the electorate and having witnessed the Australian electorate come down strongly, in common with most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> societies around the world today, in favour of the federalist concept and all that it means to State and local governments, he now chooses to take a position whereby he will seek to destroy the effective implementation of legislation which can only be of benefit to the States and to local government areas in Australia.

* Given the complexity of modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government and  the comparatively short term which Commonwealth governments are allowed between elections, it is crucial that there should be more orderly and effective scheduling of government business through the various stages of research, objective setting and policy formulation, program design and the evaluation of program effectiveness.

* If it is quite proper for the Soviet Union to point to the superiority of the Marxist-Leninist form of government over other forms of government, I believe it is equally proper for those who subscribe to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary form of government to just as persistently advocate the superiority of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary form of government over other forms of government.

* Despite the fact that the German Social <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party, the fraternal party of my own Party, the Australian Labor Party, is illegal in East Germany, despite the fact that the parties which correspond to any of the other parties in Australia, whether the Liberal Party, the National Country Party or the Australian Democrats, are illegal within East Germany and are unable to function within East Germany and despite the fact that in West Germany all of the political parties are legal apart from those which actually advocate the policies of the former National Socialist Party, I do not believe that there is any doubt that many people throughout the world believe that somehow or other East Germany is more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> than West Germany.

* In some ways the one thing that has not been clearly presented in this debate is an answer to the fundamental question why it is that human rights ought to be an issue, why it is that the legislative protection of human rights ought to be a matter of concern, not simply to the Australian Parliament but to any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliament and to any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> citizen.

* On a first glance one would say that this Bill is part of that world wide enterprise that has had particular force since the Second World War when nations in reaction to the Nazi and the general Axis tyrannies decided that documents needed to be drafted which set forth as clearly as possible that human beings had certain human rights which should be respected by whatever form of government had control of their country, be it a Communist socalled dictatorship of the proletariat or a Western <span class="highlight">democratic</span> model. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* What this Government has failed to do is to go through the hard exercise of developing a list of human rights appropriate to the Australian situation, detailed as unambiguously as possible, and then to say to the judiciary: 'We have done our part as elected representatives in identifying the rights necessary for Australians in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society; you develop the remedies and apply them, whether by way of injunction, direction, damages or whatever'.

* Unfortunately the covenant, despite the fact that it arises out of the holocaust of the Second World War, bears all the marks of compromise and ambiguity which will occur when nations with different forms of government, different social systems, some totalitarian and some <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, get together and try to formulate rights which can be won by citizens against governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* There is nothing in the International Covenant as one reads it which gives any evidence of its being fired in some sort of crucible of conflict between the ruled who experience some oppression against a totalitarian regime or even against a fairly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> regime which acts in a totalitarian manner from time to time.

* If we apply the yardstick of what democracy is really about, we need to analyse society itself to see whether in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society power is shared and whether there is a means by which citizens can feel that they participate in the affairs of society and of government, whether it be in the form of representative democracy or participatory democracy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* These things should become an automatic process, not a process that has to be worked out and which involves spending $10,000, $15,000 or $20,000 to establish what ought to be the fundamental principle of any decent <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society.

* If we do that then maybe we can look ourselves in the face and say that we have really carried out our pioneering job of establishing legislation which will generate, in the grass roots of our country, in our communities and in the organisations that our community produces, the sort of understanding that will bring about a much strengthened type of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society.

* Those principles were able to be set down in 1948 because through the development of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> societies, parliamentary democracies and of countries with a live commitment to and experience of what we call the rule of law, there was in that experience and over those years certain principles which could be readily brought to mind and written down as the basic principles for the protection of the rights of individuals living in a society.

* I believe that the petition is saying to the parliamentarians concerned: 'We are utilising this ancient <span class="highlight">democratic</span> privilege of presenting a petition to the Parliament, and we are doing so in our hundreds of thousands, because we want social change to occur through the normal political processes.

* I hope that the parliamentarians involved will take note not only of the substance of the petition but also of the tremendous number of signatures- some 160,000 were gained in about 10 months in New South Wales alone- and respond in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> fashion which is tolerant and will demonstrate to the petitioners that we have a robust, tolerant society which can contain within it minority groups pursuing beliefs and practices such as alternative drug use, as long as they do not involve violence to others.

* The logic admitted by  Senator Puplick  in his remarks is that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> referenda on affiliation in campuses throughout Australia ought to be the way of determining whether students are members of and pay a fee to the AUS.

* I take the view- I believe it is shared by a number of my colleagues; indeed, I would not be surprised if it was shared by some people on the other side of the chamber- that the appropriate way of dealing with an organisation of which one is a member and which does things that one does not like or may even find morally objectionable is the ordinary, time-honoured way, the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way, of gathering the forces to change the policy of that organisation, perhaps changing the executive membership of the organisation in question.
