* What we are not prepared to accept is this Bill which goes much further, in our suggestion, than it needs to in authorising interferences with or restrictions on personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and which does not go nearly far enough in incorporating within it the kinds of checks and balances which we believe are quite indispensable if security legislation is ever to be acceptable in a democratic society.

* Let me say in summary- I will add further weight to this point later- that the reason why the Opposition is insisting upon this amendment and is so concerned about it is simply the magnitude of the invasions of personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and, in particular, personal privacy that are associated with the exercises of these powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57)

* We are not talking simply of dozens of people or even scores of people but are talking about each year thousands of people and scores of thousands of different conversations being intercepted and recorded by the security service, with all the implications that that state of affairs has for the condition of privacy and the condition of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45)

* Of course, the purpose of imposing a time limit in the AttorneyGeneral's mind, as in our minds, is that in dealing with this dangerous area from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject, a person like the Attorney-General should be called upon to apply his mind to these important considerations from time to time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45)

* I am therefore thrown back very largely on the sort of situation to which  Senator Button  referred- I think with some degree of disquiet- that is, that to a large extent the rights, reputation, <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and perhaps even the future career prospects of individual Australian citizens will be in large part determined by the personal attitude of whoever happens to be the Attorney-General.

* It seems to me of fundamental importance, with the Westminster style of government which we have in Australia, that the separation of powers is the best safeguard of the individual's <span class="highlight">liberty</span>; that is, the more we can devolve power throughout the administrative structure within our country and the executive arm of government, the more likely it is that the interests and the liberties of individual Australians will be safeguarded.

* The potential for abuse, the potential for very widespread invasions of personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span>- in particular, personal privacy- is such that a whole series of safeguard mechanisms ought to be built into this legislation, not the least of which should be a requirement that the agency operate under a closer form of parliamentary scrutiny than it has operated under in the past.
