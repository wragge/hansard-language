### Sample sentences:

* He suggested that in order to compete in the <span class="highlight">race</span> it would be necessary for the vessel to be equipped with a world-range transmitter, ranging from 2 to 18 megahertz, I think he said.

* I repeat what I said at Question Time, that is, the Government deplores discrimination in any context on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or for any other reason.

* One legal opinion I have seen assumes that the High Court could well rule that Aborigines are not people of a special <span class="highlight">race</span>.

* Whilst 1 do not think that the Australian publicwould give the Commonwealth Parliament power to acquire land for all people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, I am certain that if all parties supported an appeal to the Australian public to allow it to alter the Constitution sufficiently to let the Government legislate to give land to Aboriginal people there would be a successful result.
