* The reason why I refer to the Democratic Labor Party in those terms is that we hear from it from time to time a plea that vastly greater sums should be spent on the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of this country; we have  Senator McManus  racing around the countryside, as much as his age will permit him, and saying that there should be a better deal for the primary producers and that more money should be spent; and from time to time the Democratic Labor Party suggests, as  Senator Little  will remember, that more money should be spent on the married pensioners and various other people including recipients of repatriation pensions.

* It could be said that the problem is threefold: Firstly, there is the need to maintain basic <span class="highlight">defence</span> aircraft facilities capable of supporting the Services; secondly, there is the need to ensure that the technologies of the industry are upgraded in line with the latest developments; and thirdly, there is the need to achieve economy of operation, which in itself not only involves developing projects for the industry but also rationalising effort.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0)

* Firstly, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was asked to deal with a regulation based upon the provisions in section 124 of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act which give to the Government power to make regulations concerning rates of pay, but which do not give to the Government power to make regulations concerning the payment of allowances to members of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-38)

* I suggest that had there been included in the provisions of section 124 of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act a power to make regulations concerning allowances, there would have been no problem at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-38)

* I return to the point that I made earlier, that if the provisions in section 124 of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act do not include the power to authorise the payment of allowances to these people, then clearly the payments are not legal and they cannot be supported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-38)

* I should have thought that there would have been sufficient precedent and knowledge of past procedure to make it fairly clear that this sort of decision could not be upheld, but if that point of view were to be sustained, I think the proper procedure would have been to write into the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act, a clause concerning the payment of allowances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#debate-38)

* I am yet to be persuaded that there is an authorisation in law for the award of allowances under the provisions of section 124 of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act, which is quoted as the initiating legal authority for the making of awards of this kind.

* I have no apologies to make for speaking as an individual here in my place in the Senate as to the change that must take place in Australia's foreign policy and Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> because the concepts on which <span class="highlight">defence</span> and foreign policy were directed in the 1950s and 1960s has disappeared with the United Kingdom's withdrawal from east of Suez and the United States retreat - not retreat but retirement - to the area where it can exercise its greatest strategical flexibility.

* Since I was warned when I came into the Senate after the suspension of the sitting for dinner tonight that I was to follow  Senator Mulvihill  in the debate on the <span class="highlight">defence</span> and foreign policy statement, I have had to jot down some notes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0)

* The first axiom that I put down is this: Australia has no <span class="highlight">defence</span> or foreign policy initiatives in a thermo-nuclear war situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0)

* Therefore, if this first axiom is accepted, as I believe it should be accepted, that there are no initiatives in terms of grant strategy or <span class="highlight">defence</span> strategy or political overtures and initiatives in a thermo-nuclear war, then we must ask ourselves: What is the situation in less than thermo-nuclear condition?

* All I can do is point out that there are certain significant signs which can be seen by those people who wish to look for them and which indicate that Australia will be involved in the next 10 years in a total reassessment of its foreign and <span class="highlight">defence</span> policies.

* Having regard to her purpose in South Vietnam and the cause to which she has committed herself there - the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of a small nation against violent aggression - I would have thought that the gratitude for assistance in the past would earn respect for the present alliance and that, so far from disparaging the cause of the United States, no responsible person in the Commonwealth Parliament would denigrate her cause.

* While this outmoded and lack lustre thinking by the Government persists we are not likely to have a rounded out <span class="highlight">defence</span> system, ls it not proper for an Opposition - and it is the role of an Opposition to raise matters of this kind - whenever the occasion permits, to .raise matters of urgency when the consequences of not doing so are as drastic as they are in this instance? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0)

* Those who criticise the policies that are expressed in the hard cash figures of the Budget - it is those with which I want to deal, not fanciful theories of Socialist nonsence such as we have listened to - should note that more than two-thirds of the $833,00Om is committed under 4 items - <span class="highlight">defence</span>, the States, the National Welfare Fund and repatriation services.

* Adopted at the end of 1964, its immediate purpose was to increase within an acceptable time span the essential strength of our Army from its then low level of 23,000 men to a level that would be adequate to allow the Army to fulfil its role in national <span class="highlight">defence</span>.

 Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONThe Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: (1), (2) and (3) As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> stated in the House of Representatives on 7th December 1971 it is expected that it will be possible to bring forward a White Paper on <span class="highlight">defence</span> this session and this would discuss, amongst other things, requirements of the Royal Australian Navy.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0)

* Therefore it would appear that if the act of making prejudicial statements against an accused is dishonouring the office of Attorney-General, the case against the Minister has been established - subject, of course, to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> put forward on behalf of the Attorney-General, a <span class="highlight">defence</span> which wc have not heard so far, and the matter being given a fair trial.

* But we on our side of the chamber - those of us who are in government - have believed for a long time that our <span class="highlight">defence</span> preparedness requires a law like this and unfortunate though it must be that some young people will be taken away from their normal vacations, nevertheless, the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of this country requires it.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* The Standing Committee referred to the question of whether the word 'offence' would have effect in relation to members of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* If I may just go on, the word 'offences' insofar as the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces are concerned is dealt with in section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act, which makes certain provisions in regard to trial by a court martial if the offence charged be punishable by death. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* But, more importantly, what it does mean is that that which has always been the accepted rule with regard to our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces will be set at nought in an area where, distressing as it must be to those who have experienced actual warfare, which I have not but which I must acknowledge with feeling from what I have heard and read, with death everywhere apparent," those who would desert their colleagues and those who would traitorously give away their own side to an enemy, may condemn their colleagues to death but in terms of their own crime they will be subjected merely to life imprisonment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* I do not believe that those of us on this side of the chamber who feel strongly about the matter should willingly, and without some protest, accept a position that in our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces people may engage in treason and that they may engage in traitorous conduct in the face of the enemy and, in those circumstances, imperil the lives or worse of their colleagues, and do so knowing that they do not face the death penalty in the face of the enemy but that they will suffer life imprisonment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* If we look at the report of the Committee we see that, in the one area of activity in which it concerned itself, it did look at - I presume that it looked at - and give consideration to the views of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> with regard to the laws which impose the death penalty within the responsibility of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* It is apparent that the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act creates certain offences by way of adapting to the purposes of Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act of the United Kingdom and the Army Act of the United Kingdom. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* I believe that if we hold the view that the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of our country is of paramount importance - I know that a majority of the Committee takes that view - the least we should be prepared to do is to maintain our support for those who bear arms and risk their lives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* To remove the death penalty for the types of offences which I have indicated, to me, is not supporting our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* But f do plead with the Committee to take full acceptance of its responsibility and not enter into a precipitate decision to accept proposed sub-clause (2), which would repeal provisions in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> legislation which are' absolutely indispensable to a proper system of <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50)

* I will vote for the abolition of capital punishment because in fact in time of full war when conditions are so precipitant that it is necessary for the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> to use capital punishment, the Government of the day has the powers so to implement.

* I simply say that if it is felt desirable by  Senator Murphy  to raise this amendment and to put into the Bill a clause which says that its provisions apply to any law in relation to which this Bill applies, including a provision which would, but for this Act, have effect by virtue of such a law, it means that he feels that it is desirable, either for precautionary or for other reasons, to ensure that it would cover (hose areas in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act which adopt the English provisions.

* If that policeman had not successfully dealt with his victim as his victim would have been dealt with by sentence of death if he had come before a court of justice, can anybody say that justice wou'd not have required that the death penalty be imposed as a deterrent against that sort of conduct, in <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the police?

* In deciding the extent to which it would be wise for the Government to announce decisions which in some cases would affect the level of fighting efficiency and technological efficiency of our Services as far ahead as 20 years, 1 have been mindful of the emphasis which our advisers place, as will be seen in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> review, upon the importance of timing of decisions.

* It is also clear, I suggest, that we should not found our <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy, or our willingness to engage ourselves to assist others, on a simple faith in the success of diplomatic efforts of mighty powers or on the benign intentions of rivals for ideological supremacy among communist powers.

* The purpose of tonight's statement then is to define the strategic environment which, in the view of the Government, is most likely to exist during this decade and could potentially exist in the 1980s; to describe how in general we believe Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> capabilities should be shaped in accordance with the responsibilities of an independent country; to make clear the Government's policy of strengthening and not withdrawing from our international <span class="highlight">defence</span> associations; to describe the burdens and the gains and the clear balance of national advantage which we believe flow from these associations.

* The physical presence of those forces is an integral part of the only Five Power <span class="highlight">defence</span> arrangements that make sense in the present and in foreseeable circumstances - a fact which the present British Government immediately recognised upon coming to power, and a matter upon which there seems to be a measure of bipartisan agreement in New Zealand, our close neighbour.

* In the present situation of uncertainty about the intentions of China and the Soviet Union, and the aggressive militancy of the North Vietnamese throughout IndoChina, and widespread insurgency in our northern neighbourhood, a positive Australian policy founded on an adequate <span class="highlight">defence</span> effort and on <span class="highlight">defence</span> arrangements or understandings with our neighbours may contribute to confidence and stability in the region in which we live. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0)

* There is a duality in the requirements of a national Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy: On the one hand, we need <span class="highlight">defence</span> equipment and manning giving Australian Services an increasing measure of self-reliance and ability to act alone in certain situations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0)

* On the other hand, we seek an intensification of our <span class="highlight">defence</span> undemanding with the United States and with Our northern neighbours in the expectation that the United States will, as pledged to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  since the Nixon Doctrine was promulgated, provide the foundation of Australian security against threats or actual attack going beyond Australian capacity to deal with alone.

* To lay stress on dangerous contingencies against which Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> efforts must steadily prepare over the longer term is not inconsistent with the hopes entertained by the  President  of the United States of progressively negotiating understandings which will reduce tensions among the  4  great powers: The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United States and Japan - and particularly among the  3  great military powers in this group.

* What can be achieved by a <span class="highlight">defence</span> programme giving us the ability to project Australian armed strength beyond our continental shores is twofold: It will give future governments options to have some influence on events in our strategic environment so that we may contribute to the greater security of all countries in that area.

* The Minister for Air is probably in a better position than most to estimate how long it would take, but it would seem that a very good stimulus would be given to the industry if the Government and the Minister in his own right or in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> could determine quickly some of the outstanding questions which are arising today.

* In this connection I want to mention an important statement made by  Sir Henry  Bland in September 1970, some time after he retired from his important post as Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Let me say straightaway to  Senator Bishop  and to all those listening that it is the expressed intention of the Commonwealth Government that a viable and effective <span class="highlight">defence</span> aircraft industry should be maintained in Australia and that the industry should develop with the country's needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* These ups and downs are in a way unavoidable because the industry is dependent .on work load levels which in turn are dependent on <span class="highlight">defence</span> orders. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Fairbairn),  in conjunction with the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr Anthony)  and the Minister for Supply  (Mr Garland),  on 14th April announced that an agreement had been reached with the Boeing company for offset manufacture in Australia of nearly $3m worth of spare parts for Boeing 727 civil airliners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* The Government and my Department, together with the RAAF, give heavy support to this industry because they recognise that aircraft production and, indeed, all Australian industry must in times of emergency provide many weapons, ammunition, equipment and supplies needed to sustain the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* We on this side of the House believe that if there is to be a rationalisation of the industry in that manner the Government must have the predominant say in the industry on matters concerned with <span class="highlight">defence</span>, because, as I understand the situation, GAF owns something like 70 per cent of the total assets of the industry and CAC owns 30 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* This is a long term proposition which may be looked at, but I do not believe that the interests of the Australian people, the interests of the industry itself or the interests of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of this country can be served if we have the kind of amalgamation which is suggested, namely, that it would be on the basis that a private industry would have at least equal say in its operation.

* 
 Senator Poyser went on to say that there is some dispute in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services as to who will fly the aircraft and that therefore a decision about it has been delayed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* In order to put the record straight I think I should quote from the speech made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> on 1st March when he answered the allegation made in some sections of the Press about what he termed the so-called fight going on between the RAAF and the Army about who is to fly this aircraft.

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has assured the Parliament that the aircraft is being evaluated and I think, from memory, that the evaluation will be complete at the end of the month. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Is it perhaps because there is some disagreement between the Ministers - between the Minister who has spoken today and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Fairbairn). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

 Senator BISHOP- The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has supplied the following information as an answer to the honourable senator's question: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-99-0)

* It is estimated that the requirements of civil departments in that period will be about $23m and, of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Departments, $8m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0)

* I assume that no  Senator on  the Opposition side, not  Senator Carrick  and not  Senator Wright,  will speak in <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the continuation of the discretion statement, but if this motion is carried it means that this abomination continues until we get a total amendment of the divorce law, which may be many months away.

* Today, in <span class="highlight">defence</span> of these matrimonial causes rules - the Murphy rules, as they have been known, or Murphy's law - he spent most of his time and certainly most of his argument vilifying members of the legal profession in regard to costs.

* However, if you have had any experience of these matters, I submit that to omit the Facts from a Petition which is to be served on the other party is equivalent to getting a warrant to arrest a person without stating any evidence on the charge on which he is to be arrested, whereas a person is entitled to know what the accusations are so that he can prepare bis <span class="highlight">defence</span>.

* If this is the best he has to offer in his <span class="highlight">defence</span>, the charges that were made against him stand - that he was soft on terrorism, that he was irresponsible, and that he was indifferent to the existence of this menace in our midst. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1)

* Immediately on reading that memorandum and on his own say-so, without consulting the Prime Minister - even though the inter-departmental committee involved the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, his own Department and ASIO, and even though a breach of this would cut across the whole of Cabinet protocol -  Sir Galahad,  on his little white horse, goes to Melbourne and raids ASIO.

* The <span class="highlight">defence</span> which  Senator Greenwood  put up today is not in reality a <span class="highlight">defence</span> at all because he has not studied or considered what  Senator Murphy  has said. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0)

* Here I refer to what I consider to be his honourable intention for he did not reveal the reason for several days, not until his Party colleagues told him that he should do so, that he should mention in his' own <span class="highlight">defence</span> the reason for his action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0)

* I believe that he was entitled to be heard by the Senate and was entitled to have as much time as he required to present his case in the form of a <span class="highlight">defence</span> against the indictment to which I referred at the beginning of my remarks. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0)

* I want to refer briefly to the statement that was presented by  Senator Greenwood  in a <span class="highlight">defence</span> in which frankly I must concede he had difficulties because he was attempting to defend the indefensible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0)

* That eminent helper of  Senator Murphy, Senator James  McClelland, was the first person to speak in <span class="highlight">defence</span> after  Senator Greenwood  had made his factual statement- a statement not filled with pejoratives and adjectives but a statement filled with facts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-8-0)

* Senator James  McClelland apparently rushed to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the statement for reasons best known to himself as to why he should wish to so assiduously defend the statement which  Senator Murphy  made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-8-0)

* All I say is that I find it most interesting to see  Senator James  McClelland rushing to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the statement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-8-0)

* 
 Senator James McClelland, in what I thought was a somewhat ineffective <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the statement - we do not know whether he was defending himself or somebody else - said that  Senator Greenwood  was prepared to use hearsay because he was prepared to say in relation to the question of agents provocateurs that there was only hearsay evidence, but in relation to others, on similar evidence, he was prepared to make categorical statements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-8-0)

* Judge McCracken upheld a <span class="highlight">defence</span> contention that Mangan - the man who was responsible for the bombing of a building and who threatened the lives of 9 people in an act of extreme violence and terrorism - had been unlawfully detained by New South Wales police on a vagrancy charge. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0)

*  I welcome the opportunity to join in this debate because on the occasion when the previous Opposition attempted to debate the matter of terrorism and violence in Australia the majority on the other side of the Senate denied us an opportunity to move a motion that sought to refer to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> the complaints of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia about bases and training facilities in Australia and the questions of whether there had been any terrorism, violence or any illegal activity engaged in in Australia and whether any Australian facilities had been available to terrorists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1)

* It is clear that the Opposition will follow the pristine approach to this matter, and that is that attack is the best method of <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1)

* This will mean that the Senate will proceed to consideration of sessional orders as to the days and times of meeting, the reestablishment of the Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, the re-establishment of the Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control, the establishment of a joint select committee on prices, the re-establishment of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, and the consideration of the first 5 Bills on the notice paper. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0)

* The Bill authorises that borrowings be made for <span class="highlight">defence</span> purposes so that <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditures in the remaining months of the year can then be charged to the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund, thus utilising funds available in the Loan Fund and avoiding a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0)

* The Bill does not, I should stress, seek to authorise any additional expenditures; its purpose is simply to re-allocate part of expenditures on <span class="highlight">defence</span> services specified in the relevant Appropriation Acts for 1972-73 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Fund. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0)

*  I would like to co-operate with the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  and get this motion through because, as far as I know, our members on the proposed Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> have been selected already. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-62)

* It also will abolish the death penalty in the circumstances provided for under the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act which, shortly stated, involve traitorous conduct or mutiny. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0)

* There are those who argue against capital punishment who have, in the service of their nation, borne arms and been prepared to accept all that the bearing of arms in the nation's <span class="highlight">defence</span> involves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0)

* Notwithstanding the horrors that people in those circumstances have witnessed and experienced, I cannot but assume that there would be many who on a future occasion would still be prepared, in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of their nation, to take the same course.

* Has the Prime Minister been informed of a claim by,  Mr Denis  Warner, an authoritative respected and highly knowledgeable Australian journalist specialising in Asian affairs, that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> assured the Singapore Government in early 1972 that an Australian Labor Government would maintain ANZUK with a sizeable Australian presence in Singapore.

* My early recollection was that the amendments moved by  Senator Withers  in respect of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and by  Senator Marriott  in respect of the Joint Committee on the Austraiian Capital Territory were an attempt by the Opposition, I thought, to take away from the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Government in the Senate the right to nominate the  Chairman  of each Committee and to provide that the  Chairman  should be elected by the members of the Committees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#debate-56)

* Whether the effect was that the Prime Minister should nominate the  Chairman  of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, I thought that the previous amendment indicated that it was the Senate's wish that the nomination of the  Chairman  should come from the Committee.

* 1 say to those persons who take the view that the death penalty should be removed in ail circumstances that I believe they owe it to this nation and to the persons who render service in the armed forces of this country, who may take up arms and be required to do so in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of this country or in the pursuit of national objectives following the acceptance of wider international obligations, to explain to them why, if in the circumstances which 1 have postulated they are betrayed, the person responsible should be treated as being in some way of higher quality than those whose lives have been sacrificed.

* As there has not been an adjustment of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Forces Retirement Benefits pensions since 1 October 1971, the Government has decided that rather than delay the granting of a much needed increase, an early adjustment should be made in the pensions of those who retired under the conditions of the old scheme, that is, before 1 October 1972.

* The amendment which I shall present is one which sets out to provide that unmarried male and female contributors to the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Forces Retirement Benefits Fund would have some entitlements to pass on in succession to a surviving mother, brother, sister or child, particularly if dependent, in the same way as can a married man in the Services in relation to his surviving widow and children.

* I was pleased to hear  Senator Maunsell  say in his concluding remarks that when the recommendations of the Jess Committee were brought in it was conceived that the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces personnel would receive a retirement benefit in excess of anything hitherto dreamed of. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0)

* I think a brief statement assists to point out that it is imperative that repatriation, <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces retirement benefits, civilian compensation, general compensation for invalidity and compensation for the accident victim who is self-employed be brought into alignment one with another, so that there is a basis of equity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0)

* I have some pride in having been very instrumental in securing a decision from the previous Government when our Vietnam involvement was at its height that serving personnel should not be left with Repatriation benefits alone but should be entitled to repatriation plus <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces retirement benefits.

* I support and join in the comments of  Senator Rae  about the interest and general pioneering efforts of  Mr Jess  in respect of <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces retirement benefits, because there is no question that his endeavours in the early stages were instrumental in the formulation of the scheme which is the best scheme that has yet been proposed.

* In the second reading speech on the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Bill, I gave an assurance that the method adopted for adjusting the pensions granted in respect of members who retired before 1 October 1972 was an interim measure only and that the whole question of adjusting benefits in the future was under review.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-55-0)

* An amount of $15m is included in this Bill for the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Forces Retirement Benefits Fund for which legislation was passed this session and that is to be understood. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0)

* Honourable senators will recall that yesterday in the course of debate on the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces retirement benefits scheme I moved an amendment to the second reading to project the same principle in relation to male and female unmarried members of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0)

* So while there is a certain personal element is this, it is not necessarily totally personal but is a projection of the principle which I outlined in the conclusions of the report of the Joint Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0)

* Under that scheme a serving member of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces after 20 years service is entitled, I think, to a pension of about 35 per cent of salary and only after 40 years is he entitled to a pension of 76 per cent of salary.

* Where new acquisitions of equipment and other costly <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditures can be reduced or deferred without prejudice to the essential capabilities of our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces, we intend to use the resources for higher community priorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0)

* The main elements of the maritime force are the ships and other vessels and maritime aircraft which provide for maritime <span class="highlight">defence</span>, surveillance, patrol and other maritime roles. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0)

* The naval component has the type of units which contribute - especially in conjunction with maritime patrol aircraft and aircraft providing strike attack and <span class="highlight">defence</span> - to meeting the appropriate fundamental requirements for the protection of Australia and its immediate environment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0)

* While recognising the dual role of air <span class="highlight">defence</span> and ground attack for the Mirage fighters, and the need to maintain complex skills in both these areas, our strategic situation can no longer justify maintaining 4 squadrons of costly Mirage flying effort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* 
 Mr Acting Deputy President, the Bill is complementary to other measures such as <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes and repatriation benefits which the Government is in the process of extending to servicemen, not only in recognition of their occupation in present-day circumstances, but also in pursuit of the Government's determination to provide an adequate volunteer force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* In view of the Minister's answer to a question asked of him last Thursday by  Senator Gair  concerning Labor's reorganisation of the Services into one Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, does the Minister still hold the same view as he expressed to the Congress and does he see any threat to repatriation continuing in its present form? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0)

* It is also on record that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has made the same statement to a deputation from the Returned Services League national group which met him about <span class="highlight">defence</span> and repatriation matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0)

* But there is no doubt, as I think has been announced, although it might not have received much publicity, that the real reason for this happening after so many years has been undoubtedly the enthusiasm, dedication and persistence of  Mr Lance  Barnard, firstly as a private member of Parliament, then as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives and presently as  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0)

* 1 believe that it was with a great feeling of achievement that  Mr Barnard,  as Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, was able to see that his efforts were rewarded by the reversal of the previous decisions rejecting appeals by Lieutenant Reid over a period of 30 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0)

* As I have said, I do not wish to go into the question of what happened in the case of  Mr Evringham;  I wish merely to go to the general proposition that this place is endowed with tremendous power and authority and honourable senators must by sensitive in their exercise of that power and authority, particularly where people do not have the rights that they have in courts of law to be heard with all the due protection of the law, the right of counsel, the right of <span class="highlight">defence</span> and all the legal canons that surround the rights of those people in those places.

* In view of the greatly decreased use of our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces' aircraft, ships and modern equipment with the resulting increase in the use of moth balls and the general trimming of <span class="highlight">defence</span> man power, has the Government yet given consideration to ordering a heavy cut in the advertising campaign that is still being conducted through the media for recruits to the 3 Services, as it would seem that the recruiting rate would not now be required at the former level? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0)

* In relation to the question of recruiting, I point out that it has be?n claimed by the <span class="highlight">defence</span> experts that it is necessary to continue recruiting despite the fact that in some areas there will be some redundancies, because the Services still want to obtain the specialist appointees that are required for a modern <span class="highlight">defence</span> force.

* In my first term as a senator, from 1955 to 1961, there was hardly a change in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> vote which, each year, was pegged at one hundred million pounds, although each year the value of money was decreasing.

* But even if it were true that there is no discernible threat for 10 or 15 years, now is the time to prepare <span class="highlight">defence</span> planning for an eventuality which may occur in 10 or 15 years time- not in 10 years time or when the threat becomes discernible.

* But it is not merely a question of mounting numbers and being able to look at statistics across the board in relation to the total composition of the 3 branches of the armed Services; it is also a question of what a country can do in its own right, within its own resources and within the confines of its own boundaries to mount a total <span class="highlight">defence</span> capacity.

* I imagine, and I am not alone in my belief about this, that while we certainly need manpower in the 3 branches of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Servicesthat goes without saying- we also need to muster, foster and develop resources to the maximum extent possible in the civilian community and particularly in the areas of industrial activity.

* Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner the Senate was debating an adjournment motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgency which expresses alarm at the reduction in the defences of Australia which has taken place since the present Government took office.

* We support it to the full because we believe that one of the most disturbing features of the tenure of office of the Whitlam Government has been the manner in which it has set to work to white ant and to reduce to complete ineffectiveness the defences of our country.

* In the last election, regrettably, the attitude was taken up by people not only on the side of the Australian Labor Party but also by some people who previously were sitting on the then Government side that Australia could look forward to 10 years during which she need not do anything about <span class="highlight">defence</span>.

* I was a member of that committee for a considerable period and what impressed me was the number of men, experts in the field of <span class="highlight">defence</span>, who came before us and said that the plans of the present Government to defend this country were completely inadequate and that should there be trouble Australia's security would be gravely endangered.

* My recollection is that up to August last there had been 3 times as many resignations by Army officers as occurred in the whole of the previous year, the reason of course being that the Government not being interested in <span class="highlight">defence</span> has conducted a policy by which Army officers can see that there is no future for them in the Service.

* It suggests that the Army Reserve be responsible with the Regular Army for the ground <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the Australian continent, that existing roles in <span class="highlight">defence</span> emergency or mobilization be retained, that in the event of commitment beyond the resources of the Regular Army the Army Reserve be activated as the next force to be employed and that the Army Reserve have a role in civil emergencies.

* The acceptance of this concept, which the committee calls the Total Force concept, will give the citizen soldier a much clearer understanding of his role and place in our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces; it will mean that his training, function, equipment and other support will closely resemble that of the Regular Army.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-5-0)

* I make no <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the Government's position in this matter because I believe that the immorality in the matters that we have been determining over the last several months lies not so much in the appointment of the Honourable Vincent Gair but in those 10 senators who were elected in 1967 and who have sought to sit in judgment upon a government that was elected in 1972.

* The <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Committee also emphasised that uncertainty increases over long term assessment, and that continuous monitoring and regular review of strategic developments and prospects are essential if the Government is to be apprised of any unfavourable developments in time for it to make any necessary adjustments to our <span class="highlight">defence</span> posture.

* As to the nature of this core force, our geographical position as an island continent, with a vast oceanic and archipelagic environment, suggests some fundamental <span class="highlight">defence</span> requirements and skills to be developed and preserved in all 3 Services.

* Our continuing study of the concepts and problems of a continental <span class="highlight">defence</span>, although an attack upon Australian territory is a remote contingency, will also provide useful guidance for the type of <span class="highlight">defence</span> force we should hold in readiness against a later requirement for expansion.

* However I do not share the attitude, apparent in some public comment on our <span class="highlight">defence</span> posture, that change in our strategic environment means that we shall necessarily be less secure, and that we must now act on the assumption that, when uncertainties resolve, things will be worse.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Our alliance and working <span class="highlight">defence</span> relationship with the United States continue important of course- in terms of the global balance, of our regional standing, of the long-term contingency of serious deterioration in our strategic situation, and of the maintenance of the capability of our <span class="highlight">defence</span> force in several important practical respects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Therefore, we must keep in being a viable national <span class="highlight">defence</span> force with manifest capability for expansion, and maintain its development at the modest rate now required by the assumption of larger national responsibility, by the current strategic guidance, and by longer term uncertainties.

* We have this utter nonsense in the so-called <span class="highlight">defence</span> statement about the Government's concern over the United States of America but the Government's Ministers only 12, 13 or 14 months ago were calling the  President  of the United States and his people war criminals, butchers and all the rest of it.

* When this Government took office 18 months ago it is absolutely true to say- not one unbiased person would disagree- that the external and internal defences of this country, remembering that we were occupied, rightly or wrongly, in a war in Vietnam, were stronger than they had been in any period other than towards the end of the Second World War.

* Our treaty partners, our friends of former years- particularly the Americans who helped save us from 1942-1945- must be saying: 'What is to be our attitude to the new Australia under Labor which says on the eve of an election, having done nothing worth while for 18 months "We will spend $356m somewhere at some time on some type of hardware for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services" '?

* One commentator writing about our <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services said that the Government was so ashamed but so impressed with its lack of policy regarding the <span class="highlight">defence</span> services and so ashamed of what it was doing by whittling them down that the Minister or any other member of the Government would not be game to stand up and make or have prepared by their dozens of writers a statement setting out fully, unequivocably and truthfully what comprises the Services as fighting Services.

* I hope, but I know that it will not come true, that before election day there will be enough decency, enough sincerity and enough sense of responsibility on the part of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)-  and God alone knows he talks enough- or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> to come out and say precisely: 'This is the state of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services of Australia as at this time, after 18 months of our government.

* not believe that it will be done but I know from now until election day, in the weeks that lie ahead before we come back into government, that 1 will expose to the people of Australia the rottenness and the lack of policy of this Government, the lack of responsibility and the lack of ability to get up and say: Yes, Australia, in the matter of <span class="highlight">defence</span> we think that we need no strength, we think that we need no equipment, we think that everything is safe and lovely- and we will just stay at home and waste money on the news media by advertising Parliament and such things.'

* What kind of <span class="highlight">defence</span> statement is it that fails to tell the people of Australia that the decision to reduce the regular Army from 9 battalions to 6 battalions was made in the face of strong arguments and strong resistance of the Chiefs of General Staff?

* I want to talk now about the essentials of <span class="highlight">defence</span> because the <span class="highlight">defence</span> one has on a given day should be there for 2 main reasons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Firstly, it should be there in order to meet an immediate threat- maybe a small threat, but an immediate one and one that no one can predict- and be capable of undertaking an instant <span class="highlight">defence</span> or mobile job, maybe in respect of help to the United Nations, our continental <span class="highlight">defence</span> or some South East Asian role under some alliance.

* He obviously has not read the authoritative Millar Committee report which, incidentally, I understand the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has adopted, because the strategic assessment in that report confounds this <span class="highlight">defence</span> statement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Against the fact that the Millar Committee goes out of its way to warn that anything but the briefest forecasts are perilous this Government comes to us with a <span class="highlight">defence</span> statement that talks in terms of 10 to 15 years of peace.

* Lead time is the time it takes to put together the vital elements of a <span class="highlight">defence</span> force, how long it takes to train an infantry lieutenant, an infantry captain, a major or a colonel, how long it takes to put together the skills of a divisional group.

* The <span class="highlight">defence</span> statement which has been read to us this afternoon is a fair indication of the panic of this Government now that it has come to the realisation that within a few weeks it will have to face the Australian people and account for its activities over the last 14 or 15 months.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* But if we have a close look at the statement before us, at what has been put in train in regard to equipment for our Services over the years and what has been projected for the future it will be obvious, as  Senator Carrick  has said, that this means a downgrading of equipment for our armed Services, not increased expenditure on our defences.

* In reply to my colleague,  Senator Milliner,  it occurs to me that  Mr Snedden  having been a former Federal Treasurer apparently believes that the way to deal with inflation and its effect is to reduce taxes and interest rates on the one hand and increase <span class="highlight">defence</span> spending on the other and then hope that no one notices that social welfare spending has to be cut back.

* They had chosen to build or buy a home and had chosen to enter into the financial commitments resulting from such a decision, and whereas they saw fellow ex-serving members of the forces entitled to the benefits of the War Services Homes Act, and the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Services Homes Act, as it has been more recently named, the beneficial provisions of the Act were not available to them.

* I hope that persons who, for some reason such as outstanding service or for having conducted themselves as one would expect people to do, get promoted in their jobs do not find themselves in the situation of losing the benefits of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme and paying a greatly increased price for a home at a substantially elevated interest rate.

* The fact that there is a need to increase the amount of money lent on <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes is possibly contributed to by inflation, but the Bill provides for the normal increase in the amount of loan, which the previous Government found it essential to do in 1971 when it increased the permissible loan from the War Service Homes Fund from $7,000 to $8,000.

* It is well known, I think, by lawyers in this chamber that very often claims of illegality on the basis that people have not obeyed regulations is a pretty unmeritorious <span class="highlight">defence</span> where parties have entered into contracts and agreements and acted on them for years and then one endeavours to get out of the contract on the basis of some illegality which he suggests voids the whole contract.

* I do not think anyone questions that there must be cases of that character and we think that the provisions contained in the legislation which enable the Minister- or, as we would have it, the Attorney-General- to prevent matters being disclosed if it would prejudice the security, <span class="highlight">defence</span> or international relations of Australia or would involve the disclosure of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or a committee of the Cabinet are sufficiently wide to cover these grave circumstances.

* One thing which is particularly interesting about the claim for privilege in relation to the VIP aircraft matter, about which  Senator Wright  was very eloquent- I will remind him of his words a little later- was that it was not some matter of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the country, it was not some large matter of public interest about which one would have expected that there should be any concealment.

 Senator Greenwood, I suggest not quite as honestly as one would have expected from a man who proposes to be a Simon Pure, referred to a previous case when the Senate Select Committee on National Service in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force, which was comprised solely of the Labor Party members, invited various officers of the armed Services to appear before the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0)

* There is much to be said for the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> viewpoint that the user has to live with the product and that this factor may be more important in the case of <span class="highlight">defence</span> than in perhaps any other area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0)

* The Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has suggested an approach whereby some of the objections to placing <span class="highlight">defence</span> purchasing under the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> can be met.

* The purchasing agent or Purchasing Commission in this context will designate to the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> through the procurement authority the type of equipment that has to be used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0)

* This will not be done upon the basis of the user's requirements and the efficiency of the equipment which the <span class="highlight">defence</span> people would want for their services, but simply on the basis that the Commission thinks it would be good for Australian industry if a piece of equipment were used which was produced in Australia with no acknowledgement as to its efficacy or its use. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0)

* Honourable senators who care to look at the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Re-organisation Bill which is in another place at present will find that the whole of the requirement for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force will be embodied in civilian control inside the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0)

* That civilian control obviously will be responsible to a civilian secretary of <span class="highlight">defence</span> and will be under the control of a <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Minister who will be under pressure from the  Chairman  of the Purchasing Commission, as a purchaser, laying down its own specifications to say that that is the equipment that the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services have to take.

* As may be expected, the provisions contained in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Ombudsman Bill follow very closely those in the Ombudsman Bill which establishes the office of the Australian Ombudsman. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-0)

* The function of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Ombudsman will be to investigate complaints made by members of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force, former members of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force or their dependants with regard to any action in relation to a matter of administration which arises from the fact that a person is serving or has served in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force.

* While it is the intention that complaints arising out of a person's service in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force will come within the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Ombudsman, some matters will no doubt arise which are common to all Government employees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-0)

* Honourable senators will recall that in November 1973 the Prime Minister announced that it was proposed that  Mr D.  O. Hay, the former Secretary to the Department of External Territories, would be appointed as <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Ombudsman when the necessary legislation had been passed.

* If the proposed takeover is judged to be not against the national interest on this basis, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: Whether, after the takeover, the firm concerned could be expected to follow practices consistent with Australia's interest in matters such as exports, imports, local processing of materials produced, research and development and industrial relations, including employee protection; and whether the takeover would have adverse consequences in terms of the Government's objectives for <span class="highlight">defence</span>, environmental protection or regional development.

* This is not unusual for this Government but one would have thought that when major changes are to be made to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force structure the approval of the Parliament should have been sought prior to these changes having been made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The major proposal of the Bill is to provide a joint administration of the armed services of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force between the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and the Chief of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Tange Report on the Re-organisation of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Group of Departments has not been debated in this chamber and there has been very little public debate on the impact of the Government's proposed changes.

* It is for this reason that, although the Opposition will not oppose the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I intend to move after the second reading stage, in accordance with standing order 196a, that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* I have the feeling- it is no more than a feeling- that this Bill basically was hurried along and brought into the Parliament as a farewell present to the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, the former honourable member for Bass,  Mr Barnard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* As  Senator Withers  has said, it is a proposal to bring a type of joint aministration under the direction, first of all, of the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> acting in collaboration with the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* On 19 December 1972 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> announced the Government's intentions concerning the reorganisation of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> group of departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Firstly, there is ultimately to be a single Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> comprehending the staffs in the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and the Service departments and, if so decided after further study, parts of the former Department of Supply, which is an integrated part of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> system of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* I wish to emphasise this because the right to conduct a military type of activity within this new <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force will be the responsibility of the professionals in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The reorganisation is to improve the presentation to Parliament of the nature and cost of the various <span class="highlight">defence</span> functions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* When the departments are merged the functions of Service boards will be modified to accord with the redistribution of responsibilities, to ensure more efficient linkage among the elements concerned and to strengthen central control of resources allocated to <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Organisational and administrative arrangements that will give effect to the Government's intentions which I have outlined were proposed, as I said earlier, in the report on the reorganisation of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> group of departments in November 1973- the Tange report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> announced the general acceptance by the Government, subject to certain necessary legislative changes, of the recommendations in the report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The main features of the legislation are specific recognition of the Minister's general control and administration of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Minister will give directions to the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, the Secretary and the Chiefs of Staff, in respect of matters for which they will be responsible; creation of an office of Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, responsible directly to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> for command of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff will also be Chief Military Adviser to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Another feature of this legislation will be the creation of an office of Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, responsible directly to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> for command of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff will also be Chief Military Adviser to the Minister; provision for Chiefs of Staff of the Navy, Army and Air Force, to exercise command of their respective services under the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, administration of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force to be the joint responsibility of the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff and the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, except in relation to matters coming within the command vested in the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff of the Chiefs of Staff or in relation to matters specified by the Minister to be the responsibility of either the Secretary or the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff; the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff and Chiefs of Staff to have direct access to the Minister- something which has not been possible in the past- in relation to their professional military responsibilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Here I pause to say that, in the course of the inquiry conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> into the running of the affairs of the Army, great emphasis was placed on the fear amongst the professional soldiers in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces of the intrusion of the civilian element as authorities having access to the Minister and taking precedence over the professional officers in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* I am delighted to see, as I said earlier, that the Minister has been responsive to this and has built into this legislation the necessary safeguards which will protect and preserve the position of the professional officer in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* It will clearly distinguish between the functions of those people and the functions to be exercised by the civilian element in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Finally, the <span class="highlight">defence</span> research and development activities will be transferred to the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> from the Department of Manufacturing Industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* It is expected that these changes will lead to significant improvements in <span class="highlight">defence</span> administration in the years ahead. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The major advantages can be summarised as follows: Firstly, the changes will improve both ministerial supervision and the presentation to Parliament of the nature and cost of the various <span class="highlight">defence</span> functions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Secondly, the military power of command is clearly defined with, for the first time, a clear line of command for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force, under the Minister, from the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff through the Chiefs of each Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Thirdly, a single Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> will enable improvements in administration, particularly in force structure planning, resource allocation, financial management and the management of civilian personnel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* This is a substantial improvement in the systema system which existed under the previous Government despite the recommendations that were made to it over the years and despite the acknowledged fact that reorganisation of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> structure of this country into a single <span class="highlight">defence</span> force was most desirable from the point of view of the efficient functioning of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force and having proper regard to the necessary economies to be effected in matters of this kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* That is not to say, of course, that there are to be cut-backs in the equipment available to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force or in any way a limitation on the necessary functions of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Quite obviously, where we formerly had 5 departments looking after the affairs of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces, there must be, of necessity, economies to be gained from bringing the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force into a single unitary structure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The role of the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> is very important indeed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* I can recall- it is embodied within the report of the Senate Committee- the problems and apprehensions of people in relation not only to the functions of the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> but also the civilian element in the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> which appeared to be gaining an ascendant position over the professionals in the Services who had devoted their lives to the 3 arms of the Services and who feared that the interference by the civilian element- it is always possible, I suppose, in peace time- would greatly undermine their authority and diminish the effectiveness of the highly trained officers in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* It endeavours to strike a proper and reasonable balance between the functions of the 2 elements- the civilian element and the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force element- so that we get a totally, wholly integrated, smoothly functioning system, which has not been the case in the years since the Second World War. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Also, it is believed that the reorganisation of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force along the lines proposed in this Bill will enable a much more speedy transition from a peace time to a war time situation than is currently possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* If we have to build a <span class="highlight">defence</span> potential in the event of an attack upon this country and get into a state of <span class="highlight">defence</span> preparedness, it stands to reason that this can be done with far greater ease and speed and in a much more beneficial way if we have a single unitary <span class="highlight">defence</span> force than if we have to gather together the threads of 5 departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* I think it is important to realise that this is the function and the role that the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> would be fulfilling. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* To the extent that specific powers are given in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act to the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff and the Chiefs of Staff, these powers of the Secretary must be read down. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* In particular, under new section 9a  (  1 ), the administration of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force is vested jointly in the Secretary and the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Under proposed new section 9 (3) the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff and the Chiefs of Staff are given the responsibility of advising the Minister on matters relating to the command which is vested in them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* In other words, the professionals in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services have direct access to the Minister as distinct from the situation in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Chiefs of Staff of the 3 arms of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services will have this access similarly for the first time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, including the preparation of policy advice and recommendations to the Minister will flow from this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* For example, since December 1973 Service positions in the Central <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Organisation have increased from some 130 to 490, of which some 340 have already been filled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* To ensure the necessary close co-operation, provision is made for two-hatted arrangements whereby senior Service officers in key areas, such as material and supply, will be responsible both to their Service chiefs and to their functional heads in the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* So the Bill spells out quite clearly changes in the structure of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force which have been urged upon the governments of this country over the years- at least for the past 17 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Labor Government upon resuming office in 1 972 undertook to bring about a consolidation of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> services of this country under a single <span class="highlight">defence</span> force and, having agreed upon that step, proceeded to put the proposition into effect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* On 28 January this year, the restructuring of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> into the functional groupings approved by the Government was implemented to the extent possible pending the abolition of the Service Boards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* There has already been a significant increase in the direct participation by officers from the Navy, Army and Air Force in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Department business of strategic assessment, works and equipment programming, and advising on the use of total manpower. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* As I mentioned earlier, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> reported very strongly on the aspects of growing disagreement between the civilian and Service elements in the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* It was a matter which was causing increasing concern to those people involved who were ensuring an adequate <span class="highlight">defence</span> force in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* It was acknowledged that the problem that was growing had to be cut off and that there had to be a proper rationalisation of the functions of the two elements in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* Naturally it is accepted that further changes to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> organisation may be required from time to time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The question of the role of the GovernorGeneral as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army was raised in the discussions of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> also. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* They have been examined by the very Committee to which  Senator Withers  suggested we should refer this matter- the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* What has been attempted in this Bill- the restructuring of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force of the country into two elements, the civilian and the Service sectors- has been largely achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* The civilian and the Service elements in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force as it now is are in substantial agreement on the roles that will be performed and on the necessity for the restructuring. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* From my knowledge of the Morshead report and of other commitments that the Liberal-Country Party Government was heading towards, I doubt very much whether it ever envisaged vesting the power proposed to be vested in the Public Service in relation to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> structure or the power that the Minister is to exercise over the <span class="highlight">defence</span> chiefs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* It is necessary that the government of the day, as the custodian of the people's money and the people's interests, decide the amount that should be given to a <span class="highlight">defence</span> structure and decide what the requirements of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces should be at any given time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0)

* But having done that and having made that decision in consultation with the experts in the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, particularly the senior Service personnel, I believe that it should then leave it to the experienced personnel to decide how best the money allocated is to be spent in the interests of our <span class="highlight">defence</span>.

* One of the tragedies which I see in relation to the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Reorganization Bill is the proposal by the Opposition to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>.

* The new organisation proposed in this Bill has been criticised on the ground that it gives too much control to the Secretary of the Department, but I believe that a close look at the Department's makeup will allay any such criticism in that the Secretary and the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff will jointly control the Department, thus, as it were, rendering unto Caesar all things that are Caesar's and unto others all things that belong to them.

* I have regretfully come to believe that despite the greatly increased service input into the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Department the proposed reorganisation is a mistake of unprecedented magnitudefar beyond that of the short lived pentropic division and with far greater implications for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> and security of Australia, whereas the previous organisation was clumsy and time consuming the proposed one is guaranteed in vital aspects to be immensely unwieldy and frustration making in peace and potentially disastrous in war.

* Victor Smith say, then basically the general structure of the Bill is fallacious because when one comes to the next step in the Bill, that is, administration, one finds what is called happily a diarchy, a sort of Siamese twin control, whereby administration, which is undefined, is to be a parallel job, a twin job divided between the Chief of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff and the Secretary of the Department, with some qualifications.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* As a result of its examination of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Department, the Panel found that effective civilian control is impaired by a generally excessive centralisation of decision-making authority at the level of the Secretary of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>.

* Will it explain to us this fundamental: How does it propose that the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff shall have command when so much of the basis of his command is shared at least, or in fact overruled at least, by the Public Service, by civilians? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* Surely the basis of what we seek is that the control of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> system, the control of the military forces, shall first of all lie in the sovereignty of this Parliament and, secondly, that it shall be executed through the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, a parliamentarian, a political figure, who represents the triumph of the civilian power and the parliamentary system over the military. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* The administration- as distinct from Command- of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force is to be vested jointly in the Secretary and Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, subject to, and in accordance with, any directions of the Minister and except for matters falling within the command of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force or other matters that may be specified by the Minister as a further exception. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* It of course applauds the execution of power over the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force through the Minister, through the Executive Government, through the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* This is being done, as I have said, at a time of the greatest potential instability in our region in the post-war years and at a time when, for even continental <span class="highlight">defence</span> or for peacekeeping purposes, it may be vitally necessary with immediacy to put small peacekeeping forces into action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* The percentage of the total <span class="highlight">defence</span> budget spent on the procurement of equipment has dropped from 29 per cent to 19 per cent in the space of 2 years, and this has been allowed to happen by a government that asks us to put trust in it, a government which says things and then does the opposite.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* The title of this Bill is ' A Bill for an Act to amend the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act 1903-73, and other Acts, for purposes related to the reorganization of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force, and for other purposes'.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to insert in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Act new sections 8, 9, 9a and 9b. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* In providing in the proposed new section 9 for command to be exercised by a Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff or by Chiefs of Staff it has been expressly provided that such command is subject to section 68 of the Constitution, which vests command in chief in the GovernorGeneral as the Queen's representative. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* For the first time a clear single line of command has been established by the proposed new section 9, which creates an Office of Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff with command of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force, and also provides for each Chief of Staff, under the Chief of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, to command his arm of the force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* The principle of having a single chain of command for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force that is clearly set out in the legislation has not been seriously challenged and must be welcomed by all who are concerned with the operational responsibilities of the armed Services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* This is the provision that has given rise to much of the criticism of the reorganisation In the <span class="highlight">defence</span> organisation that is being replaced, the administration of the Services was shared under the Service Ministers by the members of the Service Boards, including the Secretary of the Service departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* Above the single Service departments, the old Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, with little or no direct military input, occupied a position that the then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, stated in the Parliament to be 'one of complete authority'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* Under the new <span class="highlight">defence</span> organisation there will be a very substantial part in policy formulation and advice played by the numerous senior Service officers who are being given responsibilities within the reorganised Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* Even more significant, the proposed new section 9a restricts the powers of the Secretary of the Department under section 25 (2) of the Public Service Act by specifically providing that the administration of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> force should be the joint responsibility, under the Minister, of the Secretary and the CDFS. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* The process of abolishing Service Ministers and the separate Service departments and the restructuring of a new Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> to provide one integrated administrative support to the Armed Services has been proceeding since the end of 1972, when the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> assumed all the portfolios within the <span class="highlight">defence</span> group of departments.

* That legislation is now before the Senate and, having regard to the clarity and simplicity of the issues involved, no good reason is seen by me as to why the Bill should be referred for study by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* But on the mode of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> and in the promulgation of legislation, it is necessary that there should be a heart to heart discussion, not on party lines, but on independent lines in the best interests of this nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* I believe that this Bill is of far too technical a nature and of too great importance to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services to be used as any propaganda base in this debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* Yet today we have what is apparently very strongly held views of general opposition to some aspects of this change- not to the concept because Opposition speakers have not claimed any opposition to the general concept of integration of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces- and a strongly maintained claim of opposition to some rather vague matters of detail.

* Let me just mention in passing in this brief address that I will make to the subject, the several complaints that have been made to me and which no doubt are very genuinely held by people who have been deeply involved in the past in Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* I believe that here again the Minister's clear authority to direct is such that it would be his responsibility to ensure that the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces were run efficiently and were not bedevilled by personality clashes or claims for parallel authority or identical authority by the Supremo of the Services and the Secretary of the Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* The various criticisms that have been made- I have said that they have been made by some very well meaning and very well versed peopleseem to me to centre on the fact that the Opposition is worried about the diarchy, the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and the Supremo of the Services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* It seems to me that the matter of the 2 somewhat equal persons in charge of our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces, the matter of the single Minister and a number of other subsidiary, if vague, criticisms could be met to a large degree if there were a <span class="highlight">defence</span> council, because it would formalise more the position of the chiefs of staff in their relationship with the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* Without doubt, they could go to their Minister through the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, but no doubt they would feel a little upgraded and a little more secure in their Service leadership position if they were a member of a <span class="highlight">defence</span> council.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* I am a little impressed, therefore, with the view that a <span class="highlight">defence</span> council, if formed, would have a public relations stance and yet provide a more secure participation in the hierarchy of <span class="highlight">defence</span> by the chiefs of staff.

* He has suggested that the council be made up- I do not wish to misquote him but I believe this is so- of the 3 chiefs of staff, the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and the Minister, who I have no doubt would be the  chairman. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44)

* If the <span class="highlight">defence</span> council had 5 members comprising the 3 chiefs of staff, the Chief of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Staff, who is their higher command, the Secretary of the Department and the Minister as  chairman,  we would have an excellent <span class="highlight">defence</span> council.

* I can do no more than compliment everybody, including those on the other side as well as the Government supporters, who have talked about the provisions of the Bill, although it is true, as  Senator Bunton  and  Senator Steele  Hall have said, that much of the debate ranged around the two different political opinions on the way the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces are being run.

* As many honourable senators would be forgiven for losing some of the details of this measure, because of the length of time for which it has been before the Senate for consideration, perhaps I should indicate that the Bill itself is titled 'A Bill for an Act to Authorise the Raising and Expending of Moneys for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Purposes'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

* Whilst it is normal to finance <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure and the procurement of <span class="highlight">defence</span> equipment from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, surely it is acknowledged by all of us that at the end of this year the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be substantially overdrawn. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

* But, because of the fact, as I said before, that the Consolidated Revenue Fund of itself would not have in it a sufficient amount to finance the purchases of <span class="highlight">defence</span> equipment and for the services of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces, it is necessary to ensure under this Bill that funds are available to carry out those purposes.

* Instead, like similar Bills introduced in recent years both by this Government and by previous governments, the Bill seeks authority to borrow, to finance <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditures authorised by the Parliament, amounts not in excess of what is considered necessary to avoid a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

* That is the position as I understand it, because, as I said earlier in my speech, it is common practice for <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure I can quite understand this- to be financed from revenue rather than by committing for the repayment of loans the additional cost loading as a result of the meeting of the interest as well as the sinking fund on moneys borrowed for a particular purpose.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is the responsibility and the bounden duty of a government to ensure that once the program for re-equipment of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services has been adopted the next thing to do is to ensure by all means that there is an availability of finance to carry out those purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

* I think it is worth noting that this is the situation in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces at the present time, despite the attempts of the Opposition from time to time to accuse the Government of disinterest in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

* But as I understand it, the Government will also be amending the Appropriation Bill so that some proportion of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> bill- this $1,7 lim- could be funded by loans raised by the Government on the money market and no doubt used to finance the Budget. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0)

* The amount sought under this Bill from the Loan Fund will be used, as it were, to reduce the expenditure side of the Consolidated Revenue Fund by transferring part of <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure to the Loan Fund. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0)

* The amount sought for expenditure on <span class="highlight">defence</span> at present is $ 1 ,790m although it could rise if the Government sought extra <span class="highlight">defence</span> appropriations in the supplementary appropriation Bills next year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0)

* The plan at present is for the Government to transfer $1,152,123,000 of <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure to the Loan Fund by means of this Loan Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0)

* In fact, the Bill authorises any amount of transfer- any amount of loan raising under this Bill for the gap- provided it does not exceed the total amount set down for expenditure on <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0)

* Of course, this manoeuvre is possible because clause 3(8) of the financial agreement allows the Government to borrow for <span class="highlight">defence</span> purposes without seeking the approval of the Loan Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0)

* If we also look at how the Loan Bill has been applied in previous years, we will see that under Liberal-Country Party governments our total raisings for <span class="highlight">defence</span> purposes using the device of the Loan Fund was $ 1,062m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0)

* Let me point out that if the balancing item required for the Consolidated Revenue Fund exceeds the total amount available for expenditure under the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> appropriation this Bill will not have served its purpose. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0)

* I think honourable senators will recall that the Prime Minister and the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>,  Mr Barnard,  made it very clear that there was no intention to unify the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces in the way in which Canada had done, I read that today  Mr Bruce  White, who had 49 years in the Public Service, and a great deal to do with the current reorganisation, has commented that in his view the proposal to follow the Canadian pattern would be bad. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0)

* I note also that, according to recent policy statements made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, there is no clear intention by the Opposition to make any attempt to disturb what is a progressive move. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0)

* Sixthly, I had pointed out that although this Bill authorises only the application of loan moneys for purposes related to <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure, the Appropriation Bills now before us contain provision for expenditure of up to $ 1,790m on <span class="highlight">defence</span> and so the Government could conceivably, using the mechanism of this Bill, apply any amount of money up to almost $ 1,800m for the purposes of balancing the Consolidated Revenue Fund. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* Once again I draw the attention of the Senate to clause 3 of the Bill which, in defining the amount of money which may be borrowed, expresses it in terms of the size of the deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund- not as a definite amount of money but as an amount which represents the difference between receipts into that fund and expenditures from it, limited of course, to the amount that can be applied for <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Treasurer was quite correct in introducing the Bill in the other place and the speakers on the Government side in this place, subsequent to its being introduced here, were quite right in describing this piece of legislation as a machinery measure for a very simple expedient of financing <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure as provided for in the 1975-76 Budget. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Budget documents show that two-thirds of the funds for <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure are provided for in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* The purpose of the loan is to finance <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure, which represents 8.8 per cent of Budget expenditure this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* How can anyone argue rationally and logically that the Government's endeavours to finance its <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure through the stratagem of a Loan Bill represents irresponsibility and a stratagem which is different from that adopted in past years? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* In the large number of answers that  Senator Wriedt  provided to questions asked by  Senator Cotton  and in the answers to another lot of questions placed on the notice paper by the Opposition in which all the queries were raised, one still finds that honourable senators opposite reject the explanations and the <span class="highlight">defence</span> that the Government and its economic advisers have provided and they have taken the stand in respect of this legislation that the Government is acting improperly and irrationally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* Whilst I can say that he raised some doubt about the capacity of the Government to raise this sort of money- I think  Senator Walsh  pointed out in his contribution yesterday the success which the Government had met in the last loan borrowings- I have no doubt that the Australian people would respond to the launching of this Loan Bill for the purpose particularly of financing the Government's <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure, or two-thirds of it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* But we are faced with a situation in which the Government is looking for unlimited borrowing, as is suggested under the terms of the Bill- although it must be limited to about $ 1 ,800m, because that is the total of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure.

* As  Senator McAuliffe  stated on an earlier occasion when the Bill was being debated, the remarkable thing is that it is being debated at all, for it is a routine, machinery Bill to secure authority to borrow sums of money for financing the <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure which will be charged to the Loan Fund during 1975-76.

* As  Senator James  McClelland said, it is a Bill which some weeks ago was introduced into the Australian Senate and was described by the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Senator Wriedt)  as being a machinery measure required to secure authority to borrow amounts for the financing of <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure which will need to be charged to the Loan Fund during the year 1975-76.

* As my colleagues have pointed out, the Bill authorises borrowings for <span class="highlight">defence</span> purposes so that <span class="highlight">defence</span> spending can be transferred out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Fund in order to avoid a potential Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Bill does not authorise <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure over and above those that are already approved by Cabinet for inclusion in the Budget and the use of the device of a loan Bill, which I emphasise is in accordance with long established usage and precedent, is simply a preferred alternative to obtaining authorisation from the Loan Council for borrowings to fund the deficit.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* It is known and quite obviously manifest that the reason the Government is anxious to raise money under this procedure is that it failed on the temporary purposes side of the equation and has to go to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> side of the equation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* In reality it is for temporary purposes because what happens is that the ordinary annual services of the government under <span class="highlight">defence</span> are financed out of loans, and this takes the pressure off the Consolidated Revenue Fund. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* I turn to the 1971 Loan (<span class="highlight">Defence</span>) Bill, of which  Senator Douglas  McClelland, in an oratorical and rhetorical way, says this 1975 Bill is a copy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0)

* So by some backtracking process we come to the position that what the Government is attempting to borrow is something not in excess of approximately $1,1 50m as I recollect from the ordinary annual services of the Government that relate to <span class="highlight">defence</span> and can be properly applied to it.

* The Bill has the positive function of re-establishing the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Scheme in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but it also has the negative function of destroying the Australian Housing [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* We support the retention of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* The ex-servicemen and eligible people still will be entitled to <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes at the same interest rate and under the same conditions as they have in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* We shall ask how this Bill is going to affect <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes and how it is going to carry out the functions for which it provides. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* I am in total agreement with what the Labor Party shadow Minister,  Senator Grimes,  has had to say in regard to the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* This Bill therefore provides for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation, the affairs of which will be conducted within the departmental framework by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

* When the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes legislation was originally enacted to provide homes for members of the Forces who served in the 1914-18 War, the principle adopted was that benefits would be limited to persons who were enlisted for service in Forces raised for active service overseas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* I want the Government to explain to me why it does not have the guts in this day and age, when it is abolishing the Australian Housing Corporation and replacing it with the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation, to cater for those women.

* Honourable senators will know that in December 1972  Mr Whitlam  and the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> put forward a number of amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* One of them had the effect of extending the scheme to include all persons serving in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces after 7 December 1972 with 3 years continuous service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* So we are now talking about women as well as men who have served in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces in peacetime as being eligible for a benefit which is not available to women who served in wartime.

* Women who have served continuously for 3 years in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services can at this point in time have a loan made available to them if they are married or are about to marry or have dependants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* May I say, for the benefit of  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack, that in 1944 women comprised two-thirds of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces serving in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* I hope that the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation will bring before this Parliament in the very near future a Bill for an allocation of land so that a housing project, a block of units perhaps, could be established for the aged amongst those exservice women and, if necessary, for their husbands who may not necessarily have contributed in the war effort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* This legislation seeks to abolish the Australian Housing Corporation as set up by the Labor Government last year and to replace it with a corporation to be known as the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation to continue the administration of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme under the old Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Australian Housing Corporation, for most of its life, has simply administered the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* When the Corporation was set up by the Labor Government, it was given the responsibility of administering the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* As I say, for most of its life, its sole responsibility has been the administration of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* This Bill simply seeks to amend that Act in such a way as to bring it into accord with the actual situation and to have the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme become the dominant feature of this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* The Bill is not one which alters in any way the terms and conditions of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* Therefore I think that most of the comment that has been made in relation to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme in this debate has been quite irrelevant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* As I have said, this Bill is not concerned with the terms and conditions of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> services homes scheme; it is simply concerned with the administration of that scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* It may provide for the housing needs of members of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services, but not, for instance, of members of the police forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* Those are the reasons why the Government is now proceeding to disband that Corporation and to replace it with the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation which, of course, has been a longstanding responsibility of the Parliament and the national government and which the Government certainly will continue to maintain. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

 Senator Coleman raised a matter concerning discrimination against women in relation to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* I point out that there is no question of discrimination against women because the <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes scheme always has been confined to persons who have served on active service outside Australia or on a ship at war. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0)

* This means that certain things can be denied to the Ombudsman and that the Attorney-General can furnish to the Ombudsman a certificate saying that he shall not investigate a particular area because of its relation to security, <span class="highlight">defence</span>, international relations or certain other matters, including the deliberations of the Cabinet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0)

* The Federal Government's proposals have not yet been released, but it seems that they will be even more restrictive than the States in relation to jurisdiction over Ministers (removing most opportunity to comment indirectly on their decisions), will adopt a general criterion narrower than wrong', and will give the Government extensive power to exclude the Ombudsman from investigating any conduct which it certifies as relating to Australia's security, international relations or <span class="highlight">defence</span>.

* It may be useful to the honourable senator if I point out, firstly, that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has detailed the main facts of this matter in a letter to  Mr Uren  dated 4 February and, secondly, that no government has ever pretended that Maralinga is not a contaminated area.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-25-0)

* Under that clause, it is a <span class="highlight">defence</span> to a prosecution for an offence against this Act if the defendant proves that he did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the person in relation to whom the offence is alleged to be committed is an internationally protected person.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0)

* However, the fact of the matter is that it has been decided by the High Court of Australia that in relation to a special charge of assault against a policeman it was not any <span class="highlight">defence</span> to say that the accused did not know even that the victim was a policeman, much less for him to say that he had no reason to know. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0)

* In fact, the provisions of clause 9 of the Bill give an additional <span class="highlight">defence</span> to a person and are not actually restricting rights as was perhaps suggested in another place.

* As stated in the White Paper our assessments of the international situation have not revealed any present likelihood of our being called upon to deploy additional forces in support of our allies or other <span class="highlight">defence</span> associates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-12)

* In essence, the Small Arms Factory is an important part of our <span class="highlight">Defence</span> support capability, and as such there is no intention of closing it down or of phasing-out small arms manufacture at the factory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-30)

* While it is true that the workload arising from small arms manufacture has been fluctuating downwards, it has gradually been replaced by other suitable <span class="highlight">defence</span> demands, usually of a more immediate nature, and by non-<span class="highlight">defence</span> work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-30)

* That priority should not necessarily be given to areas of high voting population but the highest consideration should be given to decentralisation, <span class="highlight">defence</span> and development, having in mind the fair and just policy of giving all Australians, a minimum road standard before providing luxury highways to the city dwellers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-0-3)

* As always when we debate any matter involving <span class="highlight">defence</span>, there is a tendency to confuse a <span class="highlight">defence</span> debate with a foreign affairs debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Nevertheless, there are specific aspects of a <span class="highlight">defence</span> paper which do not necessarily impinge on foreign affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I will be dealing mainly with the more specific <span class="highlight">defence</span> aspect of this paper and my colleagues in the Opposition will be dealing in more depth with the foreign affairs implications. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The document provides the basis for debate on Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> policies and, as such, should be regarded seriously although, as I intended to point out later, I believe that the Minister and the Department have been too circumspect about some of the vital issues surrounding Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Unfortunately, Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy has never been subjected to what should have been a widespread public debate, and incidents such as the Nowra fire, the  Voyager  disaster, the rapid increase in costs in producing the FI 1 1 and other peacetime incidents have not enhanced the image of Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It is worth stating initially that the Australian Labor Partythat is my Party, the Opposition Party- has a very firm commitment to a strong balanced Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> force capable of ensuring our territorial security, the security of our overseas trade, and our peaceful development as an independent nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The Labor Government, of course, was beset by problems similar to those of any government in that <span class="highlight">defence</span> involves large expenditures on sophisticated equipment and there are always strong competing needs from every other sector of the Australian economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Any substantial increase in <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure is regarded suspiciously by the civilian community as sacrificing much needed social welfare, while any reduction in the absolute amount of <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure or its proportion of the gross domestic product is interpreted as running down Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> capability. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* In addition, there is continual pressure not only from within Australia but from outside to reduce <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure as a contributing factor to the lessening of the arms race. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Within those restraints, it is extraordinarily difficult for a <span class="highlight">Defence</span> White Paper and its financial implications to prove acceptable to all sections of the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Thirdly, it indicates that Australia might be forced politically to re-assess its <span class="highlight">defence</span> arrangements with the United States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The possibility is more likely if the United States  President  is able to achieve an effective reduction in the United States <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It may be highly unlikely at present but for <span class="highlight">defence</span> purposes we need to consider and assess the possibility of governments to the near north of Australia in the future not being disposed in a friendly way towards our country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The White Paper does not contemplate these possibilities and I am sure that none of us hope that they would ever arise but in the assessment of a <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy and strategy for the Government these options must be considered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The White Paper has given inadequate attention to this area and has not discussed how best Australia might continue its involvement in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The strategic situation is important because its assessment has such a bearing on the equipment procurement and the manpower recruitment in our <span class="highlight">defence</span> programs and our deployment programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The equipment and organisation of a coast guard service would be closely linked with the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces and in time of war or national emergency presumably would come under their jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* While the White Paper refers to increasing sophistication in <span class="highlight">defence</span> equipment it has not drawn out the implications for the financing of the purchase of new equipment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* As costs continue to increase rapidly and <span class="highlight">defence</span> equipment and associated technology becomes more sophisticated, the current financial provisions may be totally inadequate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I share the reservations of my colleague,  Mr Hayden,  in the House of Representatives, about the financial aspects of the whole paper and would like to see the matter referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>.

* In the 18 or 19 years that I have been a senator it has always been my attitude that there should be no real quarrels between the Opposition and the Government of the day, whatever their complexion, on the matter of <span class="highlight">defence</span> for the sole and simple reason that any true Australian must be concerned to see that the integrity of his own homeland is maintained.

* The <span class="highlight">defence</span> problems we have in Australia relate to that old problem that confronts the <span class="highlight">defence</span> planners and the Government, that the strategical assessment of a <span class="highlight">defence</span> problem is based upon that fundamental problem that strategy always poses, namely, that it presents the option of difficulties.

* Perhaps in this context we should examine seriously whether we should leave 2 squadrons of Mirage aircraft in Butterworth because once we abandon the forward <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy we should automatically withdraw the Royal Australian Air Force presence from Butterworth and bring it back to Australia.

* Finally, we had one brigade group that had been gathered together to represent the Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> effort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I felt heartened to think that I was seeing another generation of young Australians, both officers and other ranks, who were accepting the obligations of <span class="highlight">defence</span> and citizenship of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I said: 'But if this were reality and not an exercise, what tonnage would be required to support the <span class="highlight">defence</span> effort that this exercise represents?' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The <span class="highlight">defence</span> of Australia is an extraordinarily difficult problem. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The White Paper makes it clear that the priority goes on naval and maritime <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It makes the air <span class="highlight">defence</span> structure the second priority or gives it equal priority to naval <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* In the final analysis, the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of a country rests on that unfortunate man, the infantryman, who moves on to the enemy's area on his flat feet- as  Senator Bishop  did on another occasion at another time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It is the Army that is the poor relation of the Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> structure at the moment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* There is hardly a <span class="highlight">defence</span> force left in Great Britain as a result of its economic condition; the armed forces there have been reduced to almost nothing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* 
 -Mr President, I am sure that we are all distressed to learn that  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack finds the White Paper which his Government has produced on <span class="highlight">defence</span> to be unsatisfactory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* As  Senator Wriedt  has said, when we are debating <span class="highlight">defence</span>, there are 2 matters which must be considered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* One is the technical aspects of <span class="highlight">defence</span> itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The other concerns the foreign policy ramifications of <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It is interesting when one reads the White Paper which we now have before us to find that this idea apparently has been quite blithely abandoned- one might even say abandoned in a cavalier fashion if it were not for the fact that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has such a round head. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The authors of the White Paper on <span class="highlight">defence</span> go on and turn to the Indian Ocean. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Now you read it in a White Paper from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> brought down a report on this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It will be completely entitled to do it because it would be in self <span class="highlight">defence</span> that they would be doing it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* If this White Paper were meant to be some sort of examination in depth of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> problems which face this country at present I would have hoped that there might have been some consideration given to the dramatic change which has taken place in Indonesian foreign policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* But when we are looking at the issues which confront Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span>, instead of talking about what might have happened in Peking we ought to be looking at what actually has happened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* That territory is not even mentioned in this <span class="highlight">defence</span> White Paper. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The best means Australia has of <span class="highlight">defence</span> is not by buying arms, not by buying cruisers, not by talking about having atomic bombs, but by its foreign policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* That is our best means of <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The only way in which we can secure our <span class="highlight">defence</span> is by our foreign policy, by taking steps to see that the super powers are not in the Indian Ocean, whatever may happen with Indonesia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* That is the surest path to peace and the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I support the White Paper on <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Of course, I do not think that that has any great relevance at all to the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It is perfectly obvious that if this world ever gets to the point where there is a conflagration between the super powers- that description is not only used in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> White Paper but also it is commonly used in the  Daily Mirror  and the Press around Australia- then Australia's hopes of survival lie purely and simply in its capacity over the years to impress its more powerful allies that it is a place which is worth saving. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Earlier tonight in this debate  Senator Wriedt  spoke with, I felt, a general acceptance of the responsibility of the White Paper on <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* But I think it is a point of view which has to be looked at in the context of <span class="highlight">defence</span> itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* <span class="highlight">Defence</span> is an extraordinarily sensitive area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* If, indeed, there is an area of criticism about the lack of detail, I believe it is because <span class="highlight">defence</span>, whether it be in Australia or in any other country, is a sensitive subject which one does not shout from the housetops. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The extraordinarily important thing is that we recognise the matters which have number one priority in the context of Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> and go to the very limit of our financial capacity to bring those things about as quickly as possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I believe that the Paper is important, and probably a measure of congratulations is due to the Government and to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen)  for having brought down this responsible analysis of the possible commitments of Australia in relation to <span class="highlight">defence</span> and her capacity to meet them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Our economy certainly is a restraining influence on our capacity to build up our <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The concept of forward <span class="highlight">defence</span> has been mentioned once or twice tonight. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Indeed, as we find ourselves today in this part of the world, we can see forward <span class="highlight">defence</span> only in terms of going to the aid of our immediate neighbours. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Through the passage of time, and because of the circumstances that have occurred in South-East Asia in particular in the last 10 or 15 years, we have a situation in which forward <span class="highlight">defence</span> does not make the sort of sense that it did traditionally during the first 50 or 60 years of Australian Federation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* During those years Australians fought on many occasions- in Korea, in the Middle East, in western Europe, in South Africa and in other areas- and they did it as a measure of forward <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It may even go so far as to help to create a  form  of national enthusiasm, a national enthusiasm not for war but for an understanding of Australia's circumstances from the point of view of security, <span class="highlight">defence</span> and our connections with our friends and allies here and in other places around the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* If this Paper through discussion has a capacity to arouse the nation to some sort of enthusiasm to understand and take action in <span class="highlight">defence</span> and security areas then certainly it has served a worthwhile part. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It has been made clear in the Budget and in this Paper that financially we are committed to a $12 billion five-year rolling program in <span class="highlight">defence</span> which is a significant step forward and has within it the basis of a continuing development of our <span class="highlight">defence</span> capacity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* This Paper also has made reference to the necessity for review and the necessity for flexibility in a <span class="highlight">defence</span> and security policy, and how essential that is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Because the world is shrinking through communications and technological change there are likely to confront us problems that we never dreamed of 3 or 4 years ago and consequently the need for review and flexibility is an absolutely basic need in a <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Though we have in large measure moved away from forward <span class="highlight">defence</span> we must have a relative capacity and a determination to move to the aid of people who are close to us, people who are our neighbours and friends, should they be menaced from some direction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that unless we are capable of establishing and are determined to establish a responsible <span class="highlight">defence</span> pattern and a responsible level of selfreliance we cannot expect greater friends and allies and mightier powers to come to our succour should there ever be- and God forbid that there ever will be- a massive conflagration around the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* We have an absolute responsibility to build the most effective <span class="highlight">defence</span> capacity with a view to the jobs that it may have to do, not only in connection with low scale attack but also because we must appear to be and in fact be responsible in the eyes of other nations which perhaps believe largely in the same things and attitudes as we do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Consequently I suggest that the obvious and natural need for <span class="highlight">defence</span> in the foreseeable future of this land must lie in a top priority being given to maritime and air strength strike and reconnaissance capacity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I draw my remarks to a close by saying once again that I believe this paper on <span class="highlight">defence</span>, if it has done anything- I am sure it has- has proved to be a responsible approach to an extraordinarily important problem. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I hopeperhaps this is more important than anythingthat it has generated amongst Australians a responsible discussion on the <span class="highlight">defence</span> circumstance of this country, a determination for self-reliance, a determination to reproduce a national pride, a national determination in <span class="highlight">defence</span> and, hopefully, across the board. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen)  has observed that the White Paper endeavours to lay the base for mature debate upon Australia's new role in the world and also at the same time to encourage the development of a bipartisan approach to <span class="highlight">defence</span> matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The Opposition agrees that <span class="highlight">defence</span> planning and our national <span class="highlight">defence</span> posture should be an area for bipartisan effort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I should mention that as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, and of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, I have been agreeably surprised in the period that I have been a senator at the bipartisan approach that has been shown. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I think one comment must be made after saying that in order to put the background of this White Paper into proper perspective, and that is simply that this White Paper was commissioned especially by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcom Fraser)  who insisted on a more realistic assessment of our nation's <span class="highlight">defence</span> needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* But it in no way differs substantially from the documentary submissions put to Labor <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Ministers Lance Barnard and Bill Morrison. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* In short, the basis for Labor's <span class="highlight">defence</span> programs of 1973 to 1975 have been shown to be realistic and quite sound, as was acknowledged by  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack here tonight. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I am also pleased to be able to say that this White Paper has finally done away with the forward <span class="highlight">defence</span> concept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It seems to offer reasonable recommendations for future <span class="highlight">defence</span> planning. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Recent purchases of <span class="highlight">defence</span> equipment by the Government have included some $8m spent on acquiring the  Australian Trader  for the purposes of turning it into a training ship, and some $25m for the purchase of blind-fire radar tracking equipment and support material. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* When one looks at the outlays of public moneys on this scale it is essential that we examine Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It has been put to me on more than one occasion, and it has also been mentioned in the Senate of the United States of America by a member of the Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Committee of the U.S. Senate,  Senator John  Culver, that in evidence taken by the U.S. Committee it was shown that the U.S. had not criticised the Soviet's buildup in Berbera as might have been expected for the simple reason that it did not want a public outcry until it had completed the facilities at Diego Garcia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Both major political groupings in this country have realised the need for greater independence and self-reliance in <span class="highlight">defence</span> planning. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* However, even though our security may be ultimately dependent on U.S. support we owe it to ourselves to be able to mount a national <span class="highlight">defence</span> effort that would maximise the risks and costs of any aggression. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I think it should be realised also that as far as <span class="highlight">defence</span> planning is concerned a number of contingencies may arise in which Australia's territorial integrity may be violated, although our security may not be put at fundamental risk. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Some of these contingencies have been illustrated by a conservative <span class="highlight">defence</span> commentator Brigadier F. V. Speed in an article entitled  Australia: <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Planners Teaser  which was published in July 1976 in the Army Quarterly and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Journal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* In this article Brigadier Speed draws attention to some potential problems in our <span class="highlight">defence</span> operation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Another problem that has been mentioned by  Senator Scott  tonight-it was raised also by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> which dealt with a reference concerning the Indian Ocean region- is that of terrorism. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* As part of the Commonwealth of Australia they demand that Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces be of such a capability as is required to ensure their <span class="highlight">defence</span> in time of threat. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* These are the enormous demands placed on Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces by simple geographical circumstances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* This has been amply demonstrated by the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> which dealt with the Indian Ocean region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Firstly, there was the obsession with Soviet military strength that characterises the thinking of both the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I would like to quote from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> when we dealt with this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Our <span class="highlight">defence</span> preparedness is a part of this effort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* This <span class="highlight">defence</span> White Paper that we are discussing tonight goes a fair way towards establishing those prerequisites for Australia to assume the role of an independent and capable power prepared to undertake its responsibilities both at a regional and at an international level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I support the amendment to refer this matter to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen)  is to be commended on this most comprehensive <span class="highlight">defence</span> statement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I think it is the most comprehensive <span class="highlight">defence</span> statement ever presented to the Australian Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* In the past, <span class="highlight">defence</span> has been treated by the Parliament as of rather small moment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The fact that governments have not seen fit to present comprehensive <span class="highlight">defence</span> statements is, I think, more the fault of Parliament than of governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I also must observe that often in the past <span class="highlight">defence</span> statements have been based upon attitudes and ideology, rather than realistic assessments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Whether one agrees with all the assessments made in this White Paper, it does avoid the mistakes which sometimes occurred in the past of ideological comment, because in the final analysis what we are talking about when we speak of <span class="highlight">defence</span> is the security of the nation.

* The <span class="highlight">defence</span> White Paper says that our assessments 'depict a regional situation with reasonable prospects of stability, although'- and here the qualification is- 'with many imponderables and uncertainties'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I suppose that the critical issue that faces our <span class="highlight">defence</span> planners and which is not dealt with at great length in this paper is the mix of weapons which will be required.

* It would seem to me, particularly as the White Paper rightly places considerable stress upon the need for self-reliance- which I am sure is the wisest and only policy- that we should have been given some indication of the Government's thinking regarding these weapons many of which, as I understand them, could be of tremendous value as they would increase our <span class="highlight">defence</span> capacity considerably.

* I rise in this debate to discuss the White Paper on <span class="highlight">defence</span> which my colleague,  Senator Sim,  has just discussed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* If there were anything on which I could agree with  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack, it would be his comment that there would be a possibility of there being a bipartisan policy in relation to <span class="highlight">defence</span> in Australia if people were prepared to grasp the nettle. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* All of this was said in an attempt to introduce a notion of threat in Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* What  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack did earlier in this debate- he has been followed by, I think, more realistic men in the Liberal Party- was to try to introduce the notion of threat into Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* I will come back to  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack 's comments on this subject and to his threat theory because I want to put the point that it is symptomatic of the Liberal Party's attitude to a <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy over a period of about 20 years, but before doing so I want to discuss some other issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The fact of the matter is that the people of Australia whatever  Senator Withers  likes to say by way of interjection, turned to the Australian Labor Party in 1941 and 1945 because they felt that the Australian Labor Party was fair dinkum about the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of Australia and, whatever his service in the Army Services Corps or wherever he may have happened to be,  Senator Withers  Party of later adoption was rejected at the time of the Second World War. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Whichever country it was, throughout that period there was a notion of threat in Australian foreign policy and we were induced to spend money on <span class="highlight">defence</span> to meet that threat. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* From reviewing the political history of that period we all know that the Liberal Party, in Government, took assiduous steps to identify the threat to Australia in order to justify <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* In the context of this debate  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack 's position is completely consistent with everything the Liberal Party has said about <span class="highlight">defence</span> in the past 20 years because always there has been a bogy, always there has been somebody supposedly threatening Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* Throughout 20 years of Australian history the only relevant facts in Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> debates which have concerned the Australian people have been threats from all sorts of mythical people, whether they be the Chinese of 10 years ago or the Russians of one year ago, as mentioned by Malcolm Fraser, or this faceless Asian man that  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack met 3 months ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* One thing that ought to be put to rest about <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy in Australia is that throughout the last 30 years of Australian history there has been one period of real warthe Second World War. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* In that war the Australian people turned to the Labor Party because they believed it was fair dinkum about the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* It was only after the Vietnam war that we found people like Malcolm Fraser, the western district grazier with all his prejudices and class concepts, attempting to raise- contrary to his own <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Minister and Foreign Minister- the concept of a threat from the Soviet Union.

* To do so would be in effect to allow further atrocities to continue and if the Government parties in the party room have decided not to accept this motion or to send it to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, let them have on their consciences the fact that every day that we fail to take up this challenge, every day that we fail to deal with this issue, people are suffering, people are being killed, and people who look to Australia to assist them will regret the day that they placed their faith in Australia.

* I merely rise at this juncture to make clear to the Committee that  Senator Georges'  argument is not valid in the context of <span class="highlight">defence</span> force members who retire at a certain age.

* I do not want that to be taken as some criticism of the Liberal Party, which is the major Government party in this Parliament, but as evidence of the fact that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has been an example of how members of this Parliament can work together sensibly and rationally to examine some of the problems that face this country.

* This means that in a factory if an employee in concert with another employee- only two of them- were to engage in conduct which constituted a breach of proposed new section  45D  the organisation and not the 2 employees would be responsible and would be prosecuted in accordance with the Act unless a <span class="highlight">defence</span> could be put up that the organisation took all reasonable steps to prevent the participant from engaging in that conduct.

* Justice must be done to organisations as well as to individuals, but the Government believes that the way in which it has gone about it in providing a <span class="highlight">defence</span> to an organisation- that it takes reasonable steps to prevent the conduct from occurring- is fair and it would have to be decided on the facts of every case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42)

* If  2  members act, without the knowledge of the union, in a manner that brings them in breach of proposed section  45d  the union's only <span class="highlight">defence</span>- and the Minister agrees with this- is that it took reasonable steps to prevent such an occurrence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42)

* In that case the union would have no <span class="highlight">defence</span> and, therefore, the union and every member of the organisation would be guilty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42)

* As I said before, the Commission, as a body concerned with the public interest in business transactions, has really engaged, I suppose, in some quite spirited <span class="highlight">defence</span> of its activities and operations.

* But if we turn to clause 5 1, the clause dealing with <span class="highlight">defence</span> to a charge of violating consumer protection provisions, we find that the <span class="highlight">defence</span> is considerably weakened and thus the position of the consumer has been considerably weakened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* At this point I would like to read out the original provisions regarding <span class="highlight">defence</span> and the new amended provisions introduced by the Government, to demonstrate how they have been weakened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* The original <span class="highlight">defence</span> with regard to consumer protection acts was that the contravention in respect of which the proceeding was instituted was due to a mistake, to reliance on information supplied by another person, to the act or default of another person, to an accident or some other cause beyond the control of the defendant or that the defendant took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the contravention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* That very satisfactory form of <span class="highlight">defence</span> has been weakened to this: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* The <span class="highlight">defence</span> regarding the mistake or reliance on information supplied by another person is reduced to this concept of 'reasonable', which I think is much weaker than the previous obligation whereby the defendant was required to show that he had taken reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* So although the terms of the consumer protection provisions are widened, the <span class="highlight">defence</span> is weakened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* What  His  Honour is there saying in more polite terms is that intelligence assessment in the past has been too much in the hands of the foreign affairs- <span class="highlight">defence</span> establishments in this country, as it has been in most countries of a similar kind, and that as a result of that assessment being in the hands of those two departments, both of which have vested interest of one kind or another in a particular view or interpretation of international events, the intelligence assessment process in this country has suffered.

* The time has surely come when the importance of surveillance and the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the north are put into proper perspective and to combat the considerable distances involved <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces, customs emergency services, police and people of the north are joined together to defend this country, not only in the event of an attack by a hostile country but also to prevent the introduction of disease and, probably the most important of all at present, to prevent more drugs coming into Australia through our northern coast.

* Whilst this is sufficient to detect targets of <span class="highlight">defence</span> interests, that is, strategic surveillance, such as destroyers, such a mission would not locate targets of interest to civil law enforcement agencies, such as trawlers, as the aircraft's radar would be unable to detect vessels displacing less than 2,000 tonnes.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* Further, if it implies that civil surveillance is not the responsibility of the Australian <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces this represents a new de facto policy position of the Government which must further detract from the effectiveness of deterrents since it leaves no prime agency with the responsibility for performing civil surveillance tasks.

 Mr Killen edges towards favouring a civilian coastguard service to monitor the 200-mile economic zone, but he has not made up his mind on whether such a coastguard should ultimately be under the aegis- in an emergency- of the nation's <span class="highlight">defence</span> command.

* Secondly, it would be a drain on the resources of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* Is it any wonder that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> wants to get shot of the essentially civilian role of off-shore law enforcement and have it taken out of his budget? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* If we are to have a coastal surveillance organisation similar to the United States Coastguard, whether or not it is under the aegis of the armed forces, its funding should come from sources other than the <span class="highlight">defence</span> appropriation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* Not only would they cover the cost of operations and thus avoid a drain on the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> budget but also those vesels which are licensed to enter the EEZ themselves would have a vested interest in detecting illegal fishing in the EEZ. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* The second reason I put to those who believe that coastal surveillance ought to be under the aegis of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces is this: My attitude- I am sure that the bulk of Australians who are interested in civil liberties and other important aspects would have the same attitude- is that the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces should not go to the aid of the civil power except in absolute emergencies.

* In general it may be politically undesirable for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces of the country to take part in what is essentially a civil function; but, in fact, the surveillance of our 200-mile limit will be both a civil function and a military function.

* There is always a danger, when a division of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces such as the Navy or the Air Force is given a surveillance function, that too much of the present <span class="highlight">defence</span> budget will be hived off into this area and that will limit the funding of other functions of those <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* It is just as likely that even if we hived off that funding and separated it from the <span class="highlight">defence</span> budget there would be a tendency for government to reduce the <span class="highlight">defence</span> budget by that amount. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* This case raised the issue of whether an accused is entitled to an acquittal if he believed the victim was consenting, notwithstanding that his belief was unreasonable, or whether he had to show reasonable grounds in order to rely on a <span class="highlight">defence</span> of  mistaken belief. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* The House of Lords, by a three-two majority, held that a mistaken belief in the consent of the victim would constitute a <span class="highlight">defence</span> even if there was no reasonable basis for it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* I think that acceptance by the House of Lords that any belief, reasonable or unreasonable, is a <span class="highlight">defence</span> brings into focus the whole question of consent and the area where the law must be changed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* One of the real problems associated with this case is that it appeared to give a completely new dimension to a possible <span class="highlight">defence</span> based on drunkenness. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* Previously it had been established in a number of leading cases that in a crime such as rape, which does not have a specific intention included in its definition, self-induced drunkenness can only provide a <span class="highlight">defence</span> if it renders the person temporarily insane in a legal sense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* Nevertheless, the decision in  Cogan's  Case  appears, at first sight, to provide a back door way of allowing drunkenness as a <span class="highlight">defence</span> in rape, in situations where the accused, through intoxication, is unable to appreciate that the victim is not consenting. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* This extension of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of drunkenness would be significant in rape, as many offenders are affected by alcohol at the time of the offence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* Again, because the British law still constitutes the basis of decisions which are made in Australian courts, I draw the attention of the Senate to that comment with respect to drunkenness as a <span class="highlight">defence</span>, which has been so clearly commented on the report of the Royal Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* Indeed, subsequent to the House of Lords making its decision in the Morgan case, there was a case in which drunkenness was successfully used as a <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* For the reasons I have stated with regard to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> powers of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed.

* The first reason is that the Atomic Energy Act, which dates from 1953, contains specific provisions based on the <span class="highlight">defence</span> power which will offer the Government a means of intimidating and suppressing public opposition to uranium mining.

* But if one looks at this situation of civil liberties in relation to <span class="highlight">defence</span> legislation and legislation of that kind, one sees history of consistency going back through Labor Party attitudes to this type of legislation which was very well illustrated, I think, by the late  Dr Evatt  when he introduced the Approved <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Projects Protection Bill in 1947.

* What attracted the attention of the Committee at that time, however, was that the ordinance reversed the normal onus of proof to the extent that it made this offence, in the first instance, quite absolute and only then did it set out certain defences upon which the defendant could rely; for example, the <span class="highlight">defence</span> that travelling in the reserved lane was necessary in order to avoid a collision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0)

* It could be remedied and the rights of defendants could be preserved to a much greater extent simply by amending another ordinance, the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance, so as to allow a defendant in these circumstances to file a notice on oath of any such <span class="highlight">defence</span> on which he proposed to rely and so that the prosecution could, before actually proceeding to take the matter to trial, in fact consider the terms of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> in question and not put the defendant at risk of having to rely on such a <span class="highlight">defence</span> in order to extricate himself at trial.

* In brief, the task force was required to take into account the use of such a system to provide high quality radio and television broadcasting and other telecommunications services to all Australians; its application in the areas of health, education, science, transport and <span class="highlight">defence</span>; its use by the private sector for improved communication information and other services; and the implications of a satellite to current radios and television services and the terrestrial communications system.

* It appears that it is due to the fact that the United States of America, which owns the area even though it is supposed to be a joint United States-Australian facility, is probably either not telling the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and the Australian Government precisely what is going on at Pine Gap or is misleading them.

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, his Department and the Government ought to take a serious look at the whole operation at Pine Gap and make a clear cut public statement admitting that it is a possible nuclear target or even a target for conventional weapons should an air armada come in from the north of Australia or from any other pan of Australia.

* The principal purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to amend the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Act 1918 to implement decisions taken by the Government in the context of its deliberations on the 1977-78 Budget and as a result of a more recent review of certain aspects of the scheme.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0)

* The proposed amendment will extend the qualifying service to a period more commensurate with the benefits offered through <span class="highlight">defence</span> service homes loans, and it will be consistent with, and will strengthen, the prevailing conditions of service for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces that are designed to encourage longer service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0)

* By the proposed insertion of a new section 27b in the principal Act, the Bill will permit the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation to give a measure of preference in the allocation of loans to those whose eligibility is based on war service.

* The terms and conditions of the cover are all contained in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Act and regulations, with the result that amending legislation is required before even a minor change may be made.

* The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a financial nature and are required either to overcome procedural problems and technical omissions or, consequential upon the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Amendment Act 1977, to facilitate the operation of the financial arrangements applicable to the Corporation as from 1 July 1977. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0)

* I further ask: Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an article in the journal of the Australian Naval Institute of August 1978 in which there is very strong criticism of the proposal to isolate <span class="highlight">defence</span> personnel in a single purpose institution and strong applause for the Navy's present policy of sending its young undergraduates to existing universities?

* When I was talking earlier about strategic policy and the central nature of our strategic policy to our <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force and our <span class="highlight">defence</span> preparations, I did not make the point then but I would like to make it now that when one looks at who is responsible for strategic policy one goes down through four layers of public servants- Secretary, Deputy Secretary, First Assistant Secretary, Assistant Secretary- before one reaches the first professional service man.

* In general terms, the Prime Minister's review of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> situation was extraordinarily deceptive, since the depletion of capital expenditure which he claimed occurred under a Labor government was a result of action taken in a period in which he was Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and <span class="highlight">defence</span> expenditure was reduced on a votebuying basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* Time does not permit me to deal with every other incident that has taken place in foreign affairs since then, but a somewhat similar situation developed in the Chinese revolution, which was consummated in 1949 when the Chinese people liberated their country from the forces of Chiang Kai-shek, who had at certain stages of that country's history collaborated with the Japanese in <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the feudal system that operated there.

* I am satisfied that a security intelligence service should exist and continue as an important part of the measures taken by government for the <span class="highlight">defence</span> and security of Australia, and that in performing its functions, it should provide the Australian Government in appropriate cases, with its security assessment about certain people.

* I think it is important to understand that although relationships with Great Britain or the United States might be an important and significant part of the work of ASIO they are in fact subsidiary to the protection of Australian interests and the extent to which one gets information from overseas or the extent to which one provides information to people overseas can be judged only by the criteria of what is necessary in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of Australia and in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of Australian citizens.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-38-0)

* The Government has noted the conclusion by the Committee that, where the accounting system of an organisation such as that administering the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Scheme is to be changed, the change should, wherever possible, be made at the start of a financial year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-38-0)

* A major cause of concern to the Standing Committee was that although interim reports and informal financial statements for the years 1975-76 and 1976-77 were prepared by the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation these were not presented to Parliament by the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-38-0)

* The Standing Committee recommended that a new section be added to the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Act to provide for interim reporting to the Parliament where an annual report, with financial statements in a form approved by the Minister for Finance, is not ready for tabling within 9 months of the end of the financial year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-38-0)

* Final reports and audited financial statements of operations under the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Scheme during 1975-76 and 1976-77 were tabled by the Acting Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 21 November 1978. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-38-0)

* However, the problems which arose in connection with reports for the period 1974-75 and 1976-77 have been resolved, and the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Corporation has resumed the practice of earlier years of reporting on an interim basis where audited financial statements are not available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-38-0)

* As this practice meets the basic objective of the Standing Committee's recommendation the Government has decided not to amend the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Act as proposed by the Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-38-0)

* Having said that, I should mention that the Government has noted the view expressed in the Standing Committee's First Report on Statutory Authorities of the Commonwealth that its recommendation in respect of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Service Homes Act should be applied universally through a proposed Annual Reports Act.

* 2) to raise a matter which I have raised before in the Parliament and which I believe indicates a dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen),  and to bring the Senate up to date on what I believe to be a very serious problem involving the procurement program for the Royal Australian Navy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0)

* On 24 October of last year the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, in his <span class="highlight">defence</span> review, provided certain information to the Parliament about the cost of three patrol frigates, or, as they are commonly known, FFGs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0)

* Because of my concern about the cost of these vessels and the shipbuilder's liquidity problems, I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Carrick),  representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, a series of questions during the second and third weeks of November. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0)

* In any event, they provided much more information than had previously been given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0)

* The FFG has a capability for conducting prolonged, independent patrol and surveillance operations in situations of relatively low level of threat and combined with other forces, would provide a valuable contribution to both the <span class="highlight">defence</span> and offensive capabilities of such forces in higher level situations.

* There is little doubt in my mind that the detailed concentration on the problems associated with the Royal Australian Navy and the purchase of equipment for that section of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces is an unnecessary and blatant attack on a very intelligent and informative speech which was made in this chamber by  Senator Hamer  last week. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* We do not agree with all that  Senator Hamer  said, but it is our view that he did attempt to discuss quite rationally and openly matters associated with the organisation of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> cannot escape the fact that, in times of financial stringency, not only does the equipment have to be cost effective, but also the entire management structure of a department which has control over so many assets has to be as efficient as possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* It was surprising, therefore, that the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> sought to exclude itself from the provisions of the recent Audit Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* If I did not know the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and if I were an outsider reading his statement, I could only assume that the control of Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces was in the hands of a gambler. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Does this mean that the Casey <span class="highlight">defence</span> university, which many of us feel is an unwarranted extravagance, will now be deferred or dropped because obviously it would not come within the definition which the Minister has used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* The other night  Senator Hamer  gave some very interesting figures that I will not repeat but which are themselves indicative of the very high proportion of senior public servants who are in the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span>- a higher proportion apparently than is in other departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Sufficient to say that there are many areas of <span class="highlight">defence</span> policy which the Government needs to re-examine, especially in the light of the rapidity with which events have been changing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* It appears to me that the document deals largely with issues which have been current in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> area, that is, the general criticism of maybe the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen)  and the <span class="highlight">defence</span> Services themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* I think these criticisms have been generated not only by the recent Hamer remarks but also to some extent by the general situation of reduced activity in the industrial support area which was the subject of investigation by a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* It seems to me that this report which is generally valid and acceptable in the wide sense, must have stirred a number of sensitive souls in the <span class="highlight">defence</span> area who did not acknowledge the competence of a group of parliamentarians to look into the question of <span class="highlight">defence</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* You,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  might remember that one of the recommendations of that <span class="highlight">defence</span> sub-committee - and the subcommittee's recommendations were later adopted by the full Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span>- dealt with the question of shipbuilding capacity within Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* The committee was concerned about what it saw as the lack of <span class="highlight">defence</span> support in the industrial area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* It said that what has been achieved already in other countries- a package deal- would be possible if the unions and the management were asked to get together to make an arrangement as to productivity gains, which gains have since been achieved in Newcastle, and that there was a basis for getting a <span class="highlight">defence</span> capability together. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Not one <span class="highlight">defence</span> industry in this country is satisfied with the works program that it is getting from the Government-that is, the amount of equipment which we are making in this country- or with the way in which the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> machinery and the Minister are arranging to supply the necessary weaponry for the country, either within Australia or outside it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* I do not share the general discontent about the Secretary to the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> or about the method of reorganisation which the Labor Party introduced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* What I am saying is that now the debate is not about the important items of <span class="highlight">defence</span> equipment that we have to buy, whether it be aircraft, ships or the style of weaponry for the Army, but about discontent within an industry which sees that throughout the country not enough work is being put into Australian factories, which work could and ought to be put into Australian factories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Largely because of agitation within this Parliament, over the years we have certainly achieved an increase in the amount of work which could be called <span class="highlight">defence</span> work because our factories have been competent and active in getting such work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Having not seen the statement for long but realising that governments and Ministers are prone to run for <span class="highlight">defence</span> from all sorts of critics, I accept that the <span class="highlight">defence</span> reorganisation was a very good thing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Since that time the basic organisation has proved to be successful, but it does not respond in those circumstances in which, year after year, governments make its planning difficult because budgetary considerations come into the requirements of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces on every occasion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* I would think that a department of <span class="highlight">defence</span> has to be satisfied that within a long economic time frame allocations from the national purse have to be fairly substantial and consecutive and not interrupted by budgetary planning.

* I hope that when the debate on the statement takes place in the Senate we will have a greater opportunity to discuss the implications of the statement and perhaps to review in a more direct sense the views that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has put to the Parliament for its guidance.

* However, in October 1975 the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> announced that the FI 1 ls would be given an inflight refuelling capacity and stand-off weapon capability; but in three years all that was achieved was the provision for reconnaissance pods. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Increasing concern has been expressed that, even though there is widespread unemployment and also a strategic need, the Government has not made any serious attempts to improve Australia's <span class="highlight">defence</span> industry structure- a matter about which  Senator Bishop  spoke.

* It is perhaps ironic, as part of the inconsistency of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, that the Government is presently maintaining in the United States of America, what could only be described as a small army of <span class="highlight">defence</span> officials supposedly responsible for the review of <span class="highlight">defence</span> purchases and equipment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* In all, according to the figures of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>, there are 75 <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Department officials in Washington- 19 at the equivalent rank of major and 17 at the equivalent rank of lieutenant-colonel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* At a time when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> has had a number of overseas tours reviewing possible purchases in Great Britain and Europe, it seems strange that is is necessary to have such a large contingent for this purpose in the United States employed full time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* However, the situation can only be described as ludicrous when it is realised that, while the Minister maintains that only 75 <span class="highlight">defence</span> officials are stationed in Washington, the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs maintain that there are 93 personnel there- 70 uniformed officers and 23 civilians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* Secondly, it seems to me that either figure- that is, the 75 which the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Department officials assert or the 93 on which the Foreign Affairs Department is equally adamant- is a tremendously large number of staff to be responsible for purchasing equipment when the Government is actually ordering some equipment to remain unused because of expenditure pruning in <span class="highlight">defence</span> and is failing in a number of important areas such as the development of a <span class="highlight">defence</span> industrial self-sufficiency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> or the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  who represents him in the Senate, should undertake a review of this matter urgently and tell us how many <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Department staff we have stationed in Washington.

* Of the numerous CIA allegations Marchetti made from information he received from one Stallings, who was mentioned in the last elections, and Boyce and from his personal experience, the main ones are as follows: The installation of a super bug at Pine Gap which can monitor any telephone and telex messages in or out of Australia; the funding of the LiberalNational Country Party by the CIA since 1967; that Australia's intelligence agencies knew of CIA activities in Australia; interference in Australia's unions by the CIA; and CIA deception of Australia over the Pine Gap <span class="highlight">defence</span> base.

* I would go so far as to say that if this provision is to be given its face value,  Senator Hamer  's speech in this chamber just a couple of weeks ago, in which he revealed in an extremely lucid and penetrating way just what a ramshackle structure Australia's <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force has and that in a way that must have given considerable comfort to those people, perhaps overseas, who are interested in hearing such an analysis and in taking such a viewpoint- is that kind of attack on the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen),  on the Army, on the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force, which represents a paradigm of subversion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* Such activity would visibly and obviously be directed at dissuading people from joining the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces and, as such, would amount clearly to an obstruction of, a hindrance to or an interference with the Army, Navy and Air Force in the pursuance of their respective functions as these terms have been defined and applied over the years, and as they appear in other legislation.

* All kinds of industrial actions, for example, the withdrawal of workers' services in the supply or distribution of goods, might take the form, or be perceived as taking the form, of interfering with the efficient conduct by the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces of their operations.

* A further point relates to the second half of paragraph (b), which is concerned with the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of the security or <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the Commonwealth; in other words, hindering, obstructing or interfering with the carrying out of any other activities for the purposes of security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* That was a very general proposition by  Mr Justice  Hope and this particular limb of clause 5 ( 1 ) (b), which lends a little more particularity to  Mr Justice  Hope's recommendation, is simply saying that the powers of the or- the activities of persons which are directed- I emphasise the word 'directed'- to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force of its functions, or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purpose of the security or <span class="highlight">defence</span> thereof. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* The Government believes that activities of that kind, directed against the proper performance of the functions of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force, should certainly be the subject of surveillance by a security organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* We are simply saying that if there are activities the purpose of which is to interfere with and obstruct the performance by the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force of its functions, they are activities which could be regarded as coming within a charter of an organisation concerned with the security of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* But to leave out of the charter of an organisation of this kind an ability to keep under surveillance activities which may be designed very directly to obstruct and hinder the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force in the performance of its functions would, in the opinion of the Government, be unrealistic.

* But insofar as interfering with the purposes of security or the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the Commonwealth is concerned, any activities, be they legal or illegal- and many of them may be highly objectionable and may be intended to develop, perhaps later, into illegal activities- may well be activities which ought to be under surveillance and ought to be considered as subversive by this organisation.

* If the words 'with the performance by the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of security or the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the Commonwealth' are left out we have a much wider definition than has been suggested in the debate today, certainly that part of it which was entered into rather reluctantly by the Attorney-General.

* If we are concerned only with activities that hinder, obstruct or interfere with the performance of the <span class="highlight">defence</span> forces, we ought to say just that and not go on to say 'or activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purpose of security' because that is a definition which seems to me, as a layman, to have very serious and wider implications than perhaps those drafting the legislation had in mind when they put in that provision to deal with specific questions relating to <span class="highlight">defence</span>.

* At the same time, it should be recognised that equipment acquired by the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force for this purpose, which has no wartime value and operations conducted for this purpose which have no training value, should not be funded from the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> vote.

* I do not disagree with the decision to save money in that way, but I think the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> was wrong in the way it kept prime contractors tendering up to the last minute, involving a considerable amount of their resources in tendering for a project which was subsequently cancelled.

* As I said before, although I think the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force would be the most suitable body to carry out the Government's policy in these matters and that the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force must contribute what it can to this task this should not be at the expense of the training of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force for its prime role- the <span class="highlight">defence</span> of the country- but it can contribute a lot.

* Are they to be armed as <span class="highlight">defence</span> aircraft and, if they are going to be used occasionally by the Prime Minister for VIP travel, will their costs be charged against the Prime Minister's Department at the same rate at which the previous Prime Minister chartered equivalent planes from Qantas Airways Ltd for his overseas trips?

* It seems to me that by permanently changing the configuration of these aircraft we are limiting their use as troop carriers and that the cost of using them in that way- for <span class="highlight">defence</span> purposes- will be excessive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0)

* I wish to know whether we have imposed upon the Air Force two aircraft that cannot be used properly for <span class="highlight">defence</span> purposes, merely to satisfy the desires and the megalomania of the Prime Minister? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0)

* Therefore, I would advise the Minister to have the appropriate members of the Department of <span class="highlight">Defence</span> here to give us the answers because the taxpayers of Australia, not just honourable senators on this side of the chamber, want to know why the Prime Minister is wasting their money by indulging himself in the purchase of these aircraft for his own use.

* -by leave-When the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Defence</span> on the Torres Strait boundary was presented in December 1976 it was stated that there would be many further developments in the area in the near future, for, at that time, Australia and Papua New Guinea were still continuing their negotiations on the question of a boundary- or border- between the two countries.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47)

* The basic concept of the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force Academy was to replace the degree stream component of the Royal Military College, the Royal Australian Air Force Academy, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the Darling Downs Institute and the Royal Australian Navy College with a single academy which would provide a balanced and liberal university education in a military environment for officer cadets of the three Australian Services, concurrently with a program of professional military training. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47)

* The Committee agreed that there is a need for a greater proportion of tertiary educated officers in the <span class="highlight">Defence</span> Force and that cadets should be involved in a military environment as much as possible during their tertiary studies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47)

* In 1974  Mr Barnard,  as Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> in the Labor Government, indicated that in his view further planning on this issue was necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47)

* Indeed, I appreciate that in his case there is a problem of competing bailiwicks, as it were, because the Casey University proposal comes within the province of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span>  (Mr Killen). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47)

* The priorities are bizarre when we consider that we are allocating $52m to capital expenditure on all the universities and colleges in Australia whilst we indulge in this sort of expenditure for a project which has been criticised by <span class="highlight">defence</span> personnel and educational personnel and on cost benefit grounds. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47)

* We would hope that he would have available more money for expenditure on legitimate tertiary education institutions; that money will no longer be wasted by this Government on this absurd  Dr Strangelove  academy which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Defence</span> and the Prime Minister have been pursuing; that the money will be allocated more appropriately in the course of the education budget to enable  Senator Carrick  to fulfill some of the promises he has made in the past about education; and that the country will not suffer in any sense by the abandonment of this pet project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47)

* In terms of the actual drafting of this clause, we would say that it should not be the burden of the prosecution to prove that information which has been used in an insider trading context is generally available but rather that the burden should lie on the <span class="highlight">defence</span> to establish that fact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0)

* Therefore the <span class="highlight">defence</span> argued that because the Act was derived from the New South Wales Act and in that section the New South Wales Act said something different, the Western Australian Act really meant the same thing that the New South Wales Act said and not the words that were actually written into it.

* The second ground of the <span class="highlight">defence</span>, supplementary to the first, was that obviously the Act was not meant to be applied to a person like  Mr Crichton-Browne  otherwise it would disqualify registrars or wardens from having a life assurance policy with the Australian Mutual Provident Society because AMP held shares in mining companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0)
