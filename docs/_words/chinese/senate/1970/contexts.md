* The **Chinese** bomb is also more dangerous because it is exploded over land in a hot area where the particles are dragged into the atmosphere and they float around the atmosphere for many years; the bombs are not exploded over water.

* Then we saw in the newspapers an interesting photograph of  Mr Whitlam  grinning like a cat that had just swallowed a pigeon, sitting alongside  Dr Cairns  with a smug look on his face, welcoming the **Chinese** Minister of Trade to Australia and congratulating him on signing the trade agreement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-senate-1973)

* There are plenty of other actions open to the Government to show and move its condemnation of **Chinese** atmospheric tests, instead of hiding in a cowardly manner behind some legal quibble that China does not recognise the International Court of Justice and that therefore we should sit down, wring our hands and say we can do nothing more about it.

* The actions of Australian citizens or organisations in protesting against the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific have to be understood in the light of the open disregard by France of the ruling of the International Court of Justice and the relative effects on the Australian environment of fall-out from French and **Chinese** tests (see the answer given in the Senate on IS May 1973 to Question No. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-senate-1973)

* The French, British and **Chinese** have all done the same thing in a world in which the large nations which have nuclear weapons at their disposal will not promise to protect anybody else who is attacked. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-senate)

* We have been told by  Dr J.  F.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-senate)

* If you want to show indignation against nuclear tests, then it should be a great deal higher against the **Chinese** than the French, because the **Chinese** tests intercept about 7 times the population than the French tests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-senate)

* Of those 2 millirads, I say to honourable senators that the best expert advice is that some 60 per cent of this man-made fallout has been contributed by the French, some 20 per cent by the **Chinese** and the remaining 15 to 20 per cent is the residium of the Russian and British tests, going back to the original Bikini tests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-senate)

* I asked the Attorney-General- and the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  who is sitting at the table will remember this- long before the tests in France or China occurred this question: 'Where will the **Chinese** tests occur?' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-senate)

* In my earlier remarks I reminded the Senate that in fact we have not bothered to follow up very strenuously our protest to the **Chinese** and that we had not even sought too many details about their tests, but that we had continued not only to pursue in the World Court the case against the French but also to send a Minister to France to seek out the French Government and to attempt to talk the French Government into dropping its tests.

* It was a very interesting period of discussion because at first it was simply acknowledged that the **Chinese** Communist Party would give moral support, that it would give printing support, that it would give radio support, and that it would enable broadcasts to be made from **Chinese** bases to the various countries in Asia in which these insurgencies were occurring.

* To us it just seems incredible that this position can be maintained as the official stance of the Government; that in a public view through the Foreign Office, China can maintain friendly relations with other countries but through the international secretariat which is the foreign branch of the **Chinese** Communist Party it is seeking to undermine governments in these countries.

* Whilst it is fairly obvious that the **Chinese** are a greater potential source of trade for Australia and that it may be of benefit to Australia to share China's attitute in regard to the demilitarisation of the Indian Ocean and a reduction of super power activity in Asia it does not justify, either on moral grounds or strategic grounds, Australia's unqualified support for China.
