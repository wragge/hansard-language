* To put the matter more bluntly, the assertion of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry that Australia's foreign policy or ministerial criticism of China has had nothing to do with the loss of the huge **Chinese** wheat market is false.

* Firstly, Australia is supporting Chiang Kai-shek and has established diplomatic relations with Taiwan; secondly, Australia has continuously opposed the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations; thirdly, Australia supports and follows United States aggression in South East Asia; fourthly, Australia refuses to recognise the Government of the People's Republic pf China as the sole legal government representing all the **Chinese** people, including the people of the Province of Taiwan; and lastly, Australia is collaborating with the USA to create 2 Chinas, or one China and one Taiwan and is, therefore, interfering in the internal affairs of China.

* Contrary to the Deputy Prime Minister's crude attempt to blame me personally for the loss of last month's wheat sale, if the **Chinese** Government does decide to resume wheat purchases from Australia in the near future it will do so because of the explanations and pleas which we made to China's trade policy makers on behalf of the Australian wheat farmers.

* All honourable members on the other side of the chamber on the Country Party benches and on the Liberal Party benches know that, contrary to their claim that trade and politics in China do not mix - a little in the same way as sport and politics do not mix in South Africa - the reality is that the **Chinese** Government has announced that they do mix.

* Either products of sweated labour will be dumped here and elsewhere throughout the world at cheap prices or e'se the **Chinese** state, exploiting its own workers as so many communist states do - this is a matter of express and general communist policy - will be taking what I think Lenin called super profits from these unhappy factors of production.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* Firstly, he put to us the extraordinary position that because China was in the northern hemisphere and the winds went one way in the northern hemisphere and the other way in the southern hemisphere the **Chinese** testing did not have any influence on Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* In a written answer to a question on the Senate notice paper he said that in fact the protest note had been a written protest note which had been handed to the **Chinese** Foreign Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* Let us look at one other aspect of the Government's position; that is, its position in relation to the **Chinese**. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* The total amount of nuclear products injected into the atmosphere by the **Chinese** tests was 12.6 megatons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* Taking again the Academy's figures of one-sixth, we would get an injection into the southern hemisphere from the **Chinese** tests of 2.1 megatons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* So rather than the very low figures that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has sought to portray the **Chinese** as having contributed, in fact the **Chinese** tests contributed more like one-quarter of the nuclear fallout on Australia of the French total. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* There is very little doubt that the **Chinese** contributed closer to one-quarter as much of the nuclear fallout as did the French. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* So under any measurement, there is a very real case for Australia being consistent in its opposition to atmospheric nuclear testing and, if we are going to the extreme of taking the French to the World Court, we should certainly place a much stronger protest with the **Chinese** than the one which was firstly described as an oral protest to which, therefore, we would receive no reply and which secondly was seen to be a written protest and to which still we do not know whether we are to receive any reply. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* The position of the **Chinese** test site means that fallout from the **Chinese** tests goes across the most highly populated portion of the earth's surface. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* Therefore, the fallout from the **Chinese** tests affects literally thousands of times more people than do the French tests carried out on their site in the southern hemisphere. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-hofreps-1973)

* If we are to be consistent - if this Prime Minister is to have any credibility in the eyes not only of Australians but also of the world - then he must protest to the **Chinese** as well as to the French.
