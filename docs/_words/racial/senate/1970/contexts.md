* I can assure  Senator Baume  that so far as I am concerned there will be no restrictions based on the <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins of any person with regard to the granting of policies by the Australian Government insurance office, that any applications for policies made by any persons will be judged on the characteristics of the applicants themselves.

* The Bill of course ratifies the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* It seeks to establish its principles by providing, in general provisions, that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination shall be unlawful and by providing, through particular provisions, that certain types of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination shall be unlawful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* It is recognised by the Opposition that if we are to cope with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in a way that seeks to specify what are acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and to indicate a community disapproval of such conduct, then provisions of the character which are contained in the Bill are desirable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Bill of course indicates- it is a provision to which we take exception- that if an act which could be regarded as an act of discrimination occurs and the reason for that act of discrimination occurring has a number of facets to it of which only one is the intention to do an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, then that is still to be regarded as an unlawful act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* If it be said that one reason why civil proceedings are not the appropriate proceedings under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act is because of the delicacy of the human relations which are involved, one might draw by way of comparison the fact that that has been the type of argument which has been used to justify certain types of proceedings before conciliation commissioners.

* The first relates to the constitutional justification which might have been offered for this legislation; the second is to consider whether laws of this character can be expected to have the overall beneficial effects which can be claimed for legislation which deals with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; and the third is to specify a little more precisely why the Opposition will propose its type of enforcement in preference to that which the Government has suggested.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* What the Government is doing is relying upon the fact that there is an international convention for the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination which Australia is ratifying and which, because of the obligations which it is said flow from that ratification, enables it to exercise its powers to make laws with respect to external affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* There also is an obligation upon a guarantor, a party to the convention, to declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred, or incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts.

* Notwithstanding that I object to communism, or fascism, or <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I would recognise that it is the right of other people if they want to disseminate those views to be able to disseminate them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Convention proceeds, of course, on the basis that the propagation of any doctrine based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is scientifically false, is morally condemnable and socially unjust and that there is no justification for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* I think it has to be recognised today that there are few, if any, laws still remaining in this country which could be regarded as laws which involve a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* It must be recognised also that this legislation, if it were enacted in the form in which it is presented, would create a bureaucracy or inspection force which would feed upon detecting <span class="highlight">racial</span> incidents and bringing them before the Commissioner or before the courts for settlement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* The proscribing of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in legislative form will make people more aware of the evils of discrimination and will make it more obvious and conspicuous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* It may be that that will be a consequence of the Bill, but whether that will aid in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is very much open to question, because the more there is a concentration and a focusing of attention on an issue which to many people has never been an issue at all, the more it will create problems which never before were problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* I think that people desire to observe the law, and if they know it is unlawful to engage in acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination then I think there will be a tendency and a willingness to accept that that is a conformity which they must respect.

* I know that in the United Kingdom where the <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions have a far greater recognition than in Australia there has been legislation designed to avoid <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination since, I think, 1966.

* That is the concept in this Bill-  which is inherent in the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination becomes continually more and more plainly correct and it will be a notable day when this country of ours can join those who have ratified the Convention.

* -We are discussing the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1975 but after hearing that speech by  Senator Coleman  we could be forgiven for falling into some confusion because for all we know it could have been a discussion on a Bill on discrimination on the grounds of sex, income level, drugs, family power- anything but <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination.

* Far from eliminating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the United Kingdom.

* It is somewhat incongruous that we find the Opposition parties criticising this Government which outlined in its policy speech- it also is in the program of the Australian Labor Party- its determination to play a significant part in abolishing any forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span>, political and economic discrimination in this country.

* To my mind the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1975 that is before us is, in its present form, in many aspects of the over-government type and is restrictive of the freedom of Australian citizens to express their opinions freely and to conduct their own affairs in accordance with the dictates of their consciences.

* As I understand it, what this group is saying is that according to the view which it is spreading about the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill a person who makes a choice to marry a person of Australian ethnic origin can be prosecuted because that is racially discriminatory, but of course that is just stupid and it is typical of the sort of thing which is printed in this type of publication I referred to earlier.

* It is a case of personal desires and personal likes, but legislation such as this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill when put into effect, is the type of thing that can cause to develop, in the minds of certain people in this country, an attitude on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination that can be of a very dangerous character.

* Notwithstanding the comments of  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack and the references that he made to  Senator Button  and 1 or 2 other colleagues of mine, I do not believe that anyone on this side of the chamber believes that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination can be entirely legislated out of existence.

* However,  Senator Greenwood  did not bother to mention that the laws of defamation already provide substantial constraints against an absolute freedom of expression and of publication, nor did he explain why if the Bill is objectionable on those grounds the Government of which he was a member in 1966 voted for the United Nations Convention on <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination which is appended to this Bill and which provides for exactly the same prohibitions against incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and the publication or dissemination of racist propaganda.

* By way of an aside it would perhaps be interesting to know how that great overseas campaigner against alleged <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudices in AustraliaMr Charles Perkins- would react to that statement by  Senator Sheil  given the recent flirtation between  Mr Charles  Perkins and the National Country Party of Australia of which  Senator Sheil  is a member, and also of course the rumours as yet undenied that  Mr Charles  Perkins will be seeking endorsement by the National Country Party for a Senate seat representing the Northern Territory.

* I say to the Minister in charge of the Bill that he ought to give very careful consideration to the amendments which will be put forward by the Opposition in the Committee stage of this Bill, because it is certainly my conviction that the amendments will in fact improve the legislation, would enable it to be introduced far more successfully into the community, and would in the long term aid the objective which I am sure the Government has of reducing <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0)

* Since the first settlers arrived this country has been peopled by successive waves of immigrants, largely from Europe but also from many other parts of the world, and now, quite apart from any future immigration policy that we may follow, we have a community which is multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0)

* In just the same way, if we have a legislative framework which declares that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is illegal, that legislative framework in itself has some educative effect and it is part of the environment and the context in which people grow up. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0)

* In my view, the important thing is that the people of Australia should see that a Bill comes out of this Parliament that has the unanimous support of the Parliament, because I think that that in itself will be a big propaganda victoryand I use the word 'propaganda' in a nonoffensive sense, I hope- for those people who believe that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be destroyed in Australia.

* If those people who are actively discriminating on the ground of race see that the whole of the Parliament is united in this declaration that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be unlawful, I believe some will lose heart at least to some extent and cease the sort of campaign that I think has been offensive to most of us.

* It is true to say that the Convention provides for us comprehensive measures of implementation and there is also the Committee on the Elimination of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* This Committee has been established to receive reports on the existence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and to implement methods of conciliation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* While we may have some support for the thrust of the Bill and the principles which it puts forward, legislation alone does not solve the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, the problem of relationships between person and person. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* If I recall his words correctly, he made reference to the fact that legislation has only a role to play in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* The Minister said the Bill is a step towards the objective as outlined in the Bill, so the Government has put down a measure which, while it is very comprehensive, is conceded by the Minister in presenting it to the Senate as having only a role to play and is a step towards the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* In any program for the abolition of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination which involves the well being of a total community, a state or a nation the community must be reminded over and over again that it has a role and there are steps that it must take and that it has involvement and a responsibility in such a program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* This is referred to in various clauses of the Bill, and it relates to the dissemination of ideas on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as contained in article 4. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I think that in any discussion on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination it is important that nations involved take unto themelves the high responsibility of legislating as far as domestic matters are concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* There is no doubt in my mind that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is something that we should seek to eliminate by the most effective means possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* After all, as I said earlier, it is comparatively easy to lay down legislative processes that would seek to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but when you come to implementing them in human terms I ask the question: How do we really do it, do it effectively, and how do we do it so that the total society benefits and so that relations between persons and person, group and group, and community and community are maintained for the benefit and total development of the whole? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I suppose it is easy to say that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination exists right round the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* While I might say that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has existed throughout history that does not excuse me from being involved in legislative processes, or any other processes, that may help to avoid discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* The fact is that mankind has had to wrestle, at some level almost throughout history, with the fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> and other discriminations have existed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* We of a European society and tradition are concerned about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* It is not without importance to observe that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has been a factor not only of European society, it also has been a factor of other societies, and references have been made in this debate to discrimination in other communities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I think it probably is true to say that we have been spared the worst excesses of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination simply because of the other conditions that developed in our society at the time that there were discriminating references and habits. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* But we have had, as honourable senators know, our problems in this area and as a society the Australian community bears responsibility for what might be called <span class="highlight">racial</span> offences. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I make this reference because I think it is important in a discussion on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill but I do not speak for the Committee and therefore my references must be general and I must speak purely from personal observation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Allegations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination within our Australian society have been many in the experiences I have had in relation to that Committee, but I would not be prepared to stand up and prove them in this Senate because there is a whole range of other circumstances related to such incidents. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I may be wrong in describing this as <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Whether or not this can be proved or whether or not it is true I am unable to say at this stage but I became aware of what appeared to me to be an example of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination within our Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* These could be expanded maybe but it becomes, as honourable senators would very well know, difficult to prove that a situation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination occurs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I think it also should be mentioned that there is a growing number of people within our Australian community- there is a growing number of communities within Australiawho are seriously concerned, as have been speakers in this debate, about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia and who through the various opportunities available to them are doing constructive work to combat discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Our policies pursued by this country over these years have allowed not only a great development of our country but also a development of what I really believe to be good inter-community and interracial relations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I want to draw a distinction between the earlier inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> relations which have not been successful- at least in my viewand I am thinking of the discipline of assimilation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* This is not good for society, certainly is not good for the people concerned and might very well be described as a form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Indeed, in my thinking it is the most effective way to destroy <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Not every <span class="highlight">racial</span> group in this country has been satisfied, but times and attitudes have changed and needs today are different from what they were even 5 or 10 years ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Developments in the last 2 years have been different and it is still a matter of concern to us all that there should be groups within our society- ethnic, <span class="highlight">racial</span> and migrant groups- that are not satisfied. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I am a little reluctant but I do mention that it is a matter of regret and indeed grief to some groups within our society that the Baltic community in Australia still has a very strong feeling that it has been the victim of some discrimination, so that when we undertake legislation here, whether it be the Government or the whole Senate, in connection with the matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I think we have to be aware of the complexities that exist and aware of the fact that even the most finely developed legislation cannot solve all of the human and the personal problems in <span class="highlight">racial</span> matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* While I acknowledge that the Bill seeks the goal of removing <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I question sometimes in my mind whether it over emphasises the legal remedies to these problems as compared with other remedies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I refer to educating people against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination particularly as a long term solution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I merely cite it as an example as one way in which if not a knowledge of a language at least an appreciation of a language would help in this matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I believe, to be perfectly true, that legislation, worthy though it may be, cannot guarantee to heal <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I rise to support the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1975 and also to support, at the same time, the amendments which the Liberal and National Country Parties will be proposing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* We are, of course, discussing a Bill which involves primarily and firstly the ratification of an international convention relating to the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* The Bill concerns <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the broad sense in which it is interpreted in Article 1 of the Convention, namely, distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based upon race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* We have seen 81 countries ratify or accede to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Some of my colleagues have said that this is not perhaps the worst country in the world for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, that this is certainly a country with its tradition of freedom that ought to be in the forefront of those that proclaim freedom from <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and that set a lead to other countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* When the subject was debated in the House of Representatives, there was a general unity of purpose on the part of members on both sides of the chamber and many were the illustrations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Because of these problems, once again created by governments, we are now faced with this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I will now read in this context a statement which was made on the nature of race and <span class="highlight">racial</span> differences by a group of scientists, composed of physical anthropologists and geneticists, convened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in June 1951. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Far from eliminating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the United Kingdom. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Senator Wood  proceeded to tell us that racialism in this country is less prevalent than in the great majority of countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I would have thought that that was an obvious statement but, at the same time, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is here. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I do not accept that type of explanation and excuse for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* If I were dealing with 3 wise monkeys I suppose that he would be the one who could see no evil because he has had a fortunate life of innocence in which he has never accepted that there is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* He said: 'I am not prepared to admit that there is that pocket of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* The honourable senator has not read the Bill because the definition of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the Bill includes national discrimination and ethnic discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* These are matters of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and are dealt with by this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Consequently, in reply to  Senator Bunton  who said that he is not aware of blatant <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country, I put it to him that some of the worst forms of discrimination are those that are not even known or appreciated by people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* It is obvious that the common law has never developed in such a way that it would eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* The existing rights and remedies are costly and difficult to deal with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* In respect of this matter I would like to read the words of the Director of the Ontario Human Rights Commission who explained what was done in relation to his body's conciliation approach to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* It is in that respect that the Convention is somewhat obscure because, although it does call upon nations to make punishable by law the offence of the dissemination of ideas based upon <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred, the Convention also says that each State Party shall prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate means including legislation as required by the circumstances, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by all persons, groups or organisations.

* One of the documents I have in front of me talks about a new tribe of <span class="highlight">racial</span> officials, who will be <span class="highlight">racial</span> police, being set up, who need not be members of the Public Service, or of Australian nationality. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* Under the innocuous badge of banning <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination the Labor Party has introduced the apparatus of the Police State, with its secret Police, empowered to engage in inquisitorial investigations, fines, imprisonment, arrest, damages and injunctions.

* one remarks that this ' <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill ' was drawn up in its present form largely by a man of southern European origins and with a southern European temperament assisted, so he said, by a woman of southern European origins who was reared in eastern Asia and the Philippines . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I am referring, of course, to the use of the expression 'southern European', which is apparently to be seen in itself as a denigration, and I say that that is more evidence- I will not join in the argument- of the desire to promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> disharmony in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I have mixed feelings about it because for so many years of my life I have known <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I was somewhat surprised to find that eventually they were prepared to say that they believed it was more properly a matter of human rights than a matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the approach which should be adopted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I have always wondered whether our approach may not be better if we were not to emphasise <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as though it were the only form of discrimination that mattered but rather to concentrate on ensuring the human rights of all Australian citizens in relation to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination or any other form of discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* In any event, I got an impression in listening to  Senator Greenwood  in this debate that he was a reluctant supporter of a Bill to outlaw <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and I hasten to add that I am not attempting to overstate the case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I do not for one moment believe that  Senator Greenwood  is in favour of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I ask the Minister for Manufacturing Industry  (Senator James McClelland)  whether it is intended to apply to the relevant authorities for the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination to be ratified and whether that application is to be made forthwith. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination came into force as a convention in 1 969. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* The first difficulty which comes to mind is that, on a reading of the Australian Constitution, the power to make laws about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination seems to rest with the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* There is certainly no express power in the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to the outlawing of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* I refer the Minister to Article 4 which provides that adherents to the Convention are to 'condemn all propaganda and all organisations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and discrimination in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* For example, there is a requirement to declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred, incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* There is also an obligation to declare illegal and to prohibit organisations and also organised and all other propaganda activities which promote and incite <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* Whatever one might say about ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, just as one might say a lot of things about other social or political tenets to which one can express abhorrence, in this country we have endeavoured to provide as much free speech as we can. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* They challenge freedom of speech on the justification, presumably, that such steps are necessary to abolish <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* We have seen in the United Nations how in the name of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination countries like Rhodesia and South Africa have been treated as pariahs and have been excluded from the world community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* Other countries which practise <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination are lauded in the United Nations and are permitted to condemn other countries while their own conduct remains unexamined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38)

* That means that the constitutional limitations, the general juristic limitations, on our power to deal with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country will be considered by that Committee in considering as a result of complaints whether we have complied with the terms of the Convention.

* If we are to appear in the eyes of the world as a country which abhors <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and which does what it can to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, we just have to cop it sweet, to use a good old Australian expression.

* A nonracist society or a society which is trying to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is, I suggest, a society which can stand such criticism and which can say: 'We stand on our record and we are doing what we can to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination.

* I would put the inciter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in an analogous position of that of the pedlar of drugs, as against the man who harbours the <span class="highlight">racial</span> poison of antisemitism or anti-colour.

* But, if there is the provision of services or the selling of a house and the employee or the agent commits an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the performance of his duties, then that is the commission of an act that is unlawful.

* We believe it is incumbent upon anybody who wants to take to court a person alleged to have committed a wrong to allege that the <span class="highlight">racial</span> reason, if I can put it that way, was the dominant reason and not simply to say that it was one reason.

* If that is considered a wishy-washy point to make, I would refer to the sort of statistics quoted by  Senator Rae  in the second reading debate and to the statistics of the English Race Relations Commission which indicate that in that country, at least, a large number of cases are brought which are found not to be based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination.

* In this area of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, where we are making a start in this country with regard to a comprehensive law of this character, we believe it is tremendously important to tread carefully and not in an over-zealous pursuit of enforcement powers to create the possibility of a backlash that would do more harm in the long run than good.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41)

* I certainly do not believe that we should start upon the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas, even if the ideas be those of the proper promotion of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority, and hope that thereby we will shut out a particuar argument or a particular idea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41)

* I would prefer to see this clause removed entirely and I think that we do better in this area of trying to avoid <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, of allowing the free interplay of ideas, by hoping that the tolerance which ought to be current in this community to receive and listen to differing viewpoints, no matter how antipathetic they may be to us, will be encouraged and permitted.

* Their inclusion in the Bill is likely to create, as it has in Britain, an ineradicable impression in the public mind that the whole Bill is concerned with the criminal courts, fines and imprisonment; the crucial element in the whole exercise, the tackling of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by informal conciliation, may become de-emphasised; and public sympathy may tend to be directed more towards the discriminator, believed to be likely to receive harsh penalties, than his victim.

* Specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office already exists in legislation passed by this Senate, namely, the Family Law Bill, and I cannot help thinking the objection to the specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office in this Bill, as with the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill which was before us a few days ago, is based on  Senator Greenwood's  recently aroused antipathy to the Australian Legal Aid Office and is not soundly based in any particular principle.

* We say that as a matter of reality and as a matter of fact violence in any form threatens the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth but engendering or engaging in activities encouraged to promote hostility or for that matter hatred- I take it that the Attorney-General has really borrowed the word 'hatred' from some <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation in some place or other- does not as we put it, fall within the purpose of this clause in promoting danger to the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth.

* That is not correct since the selection criteria, the variations in the selection criteria and the ability to expand this scheme and the various schemes of reciprocal scholarships will in fact mean that the emphasis will be upon the selection of people of merit rather than the selection procedures which have been highly discriminatory in countries of origin in the past, as one can see from the practices involving the Malaysian Government in the way in which it has practised quite a considerable form of discrimination against students it trains in its own universities, and in the <span class="highlight">racial</span> composition of that group of students who study overseas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0)

* It will close off for many students who belong to minority <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic groups the only possibility for acquiring a tertiary education, given the quotas and other devices used by their home governments to exclude them from the benefits of teritary education.

* Perhaps the most succinct editorial comment on the legislation, taking into account both the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill however came from the  Canberra Times  on 29 September, when the following statement was made: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* It is true that in a number of areas like <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and also the protection of privacy effective investigative and conciliatory machinery can be as important in practice and perhaps even more important than the creation of formal rights enforceable through the courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Of course the Bill does not give specific legislative approval to the ratification of the Covenant as did by way of contrast the Radial Discrimination Act 1975 in relation to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Let me now turn to the other side of the coin, the other piece of legislation, the companion piece of legislation that has been introduced, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Against that background, let us look and see what the Government is trying to do to the Community Relations Commission in this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The second criticism that the Opposition has about this legislation is that the various functions which are vested in the Community Relations Commissioner by section 20 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, namely investigation and settlement of complaints, promotion of compliance with the Act and general research and education to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, are now all given specifically to the new Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Thirdly, although it appears on the face of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill that there is nothing in it to directly stop complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination wherever arising, including Queensland, being channeled directly to  Mr Grassby,  as they have been in the past, the Opposition believes that one must take into account the potential effect of clause 1 1 (1) (b) of the Human Rights Commission Bill, which has an effect, and which would make it possible for the Commonwealth to delegate completely to a State any function relating to the promotion of the observance of human rights, 'including functions of the Commission'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* One cannot forbear from commenting that continued pressure of the kind that has so far been so successfully exerted in the past, for example, in relation to Aurukun and Mornington Island, may well result in the Commonwealth handing back to States like Queensland the domestic enforcement of all or part of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The fourth general matter that I wish to raise about the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill is that  Mr Grassby  's staff is to be transferred lock, stock and barrel to the new Commission, leaving him no powers at all of hiring, firing or deployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* That is the attitude of the Opposition to this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1 979. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* There has been a proliferation of such machinery at both Federal and State levels in recent years, in the areas especially of <span class="highlight">racial</span> and sexual discrimination- if  Senator Maunsell  can bring himself for a moment to concentrate on concepts which will be entirely unfamiliar to him, I expect- and also in the area of privacy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I have said time and time again that in relation to stamping out discrimination the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975 has always seemed to me to be a toothless tiger as I have always felt that in most instances discrimination is a state of mind, an inherent belief, which can be eliminated only by reason, greater knowledge, tolerance and understanding.

* For the record I want to read into  Hansard- on  which note I shall conclude- the frightening number of right wing <span class="highlight">racial</span> organisations in Australia right now which propagate <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice with the help of massive resources of money from unknown sources and against which this Human Rights Commission will be virtually powerless.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* It is acknowledged by the Opposition, as it was by  Senator Missen,  that a provision of this kind, albeit that it does appear in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, is not technically necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* I believe the merit of  Senator Missen  's proposal, which is in similar terms to the proposal put forward by the Labor Party and endorsed by the Australian Democrats, is that it may, along with the similar clauses in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and the proposed similar clause in former  Senator Murphy's  Bill on Human rights, build up a practice whereby this Parliament is involved in the process of telling the international community that we will be bound in some particular manner.

* As I said, this proposal to amend the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act is designed simply to rationalise the machinery so that, when the proposed Commonwealth institution, which will have an overriding position in relation to human rights, is established, it will have that power in relation to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and in relation to other specific Acts in that area which might be passed by the Parliament.

* Will the Attorney-General tell the Senate whether he has received from Amnesty International, the United Nations Associations, civil liberties organisations and other bodies submissions in connection with the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill which have not yet been debated in the Senate?

* Honourable senators will recall that that Bill has the effect of incorporating the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination administration under  Mr Grassby  in the operations of the Human Rights Commission but does not make him a commissioner of the Human Rights Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The effect of that is that one member of the Commission, which is to consist of a  chairman,  a  deputy chairman  and not less than five nor more than nine other members, would already have been already identified as the person who holds the rank and office, under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, of Commissioner for Community Relations.

* Under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, no opportunity will be presented for him to have a separate staff, but he would be in a position to argue the need for such staff if he were a commissioner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It meets the requirement that we should not in any way turn the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination administration into a defective organisation; that we should not create a situation in which there will be a clash between the Human Rights Commission and the Commissioner for Community Relations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* For these reasons I have moved this amendment, which I regard as extremely important to the continuing operation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination oversight and the most effective working of the Human Rights Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It is a matter for great regret that the vote to reject the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill was lost last night only by one vote, as a result of the indavertent non-appearance in the chamber, in time, of  Senator Harradine. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It is obvious that a consideration of this kind is at best a barely veiled rationalisation of the Government's real reason; that is, it finds  Mr Grassby,  the present Commissioner, a political embarrassment not because of his previous party affiliations but because of the way he so relentlessly exposed the deficiency of governmental activity both at the State and Federal levels in protecting our citizens against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, it is no accident that in the corridors of this Parliament back bench Liberal members are referring to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill as the Get Grassby Bill', because that is what it is about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* Under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, which had its second reading last night, the various powers vested in the Commissioner are now to be taken from him and formally vested in the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It is further obvious from the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill that  Mr Grassby  will no longer have the right or the duty to prepare and deliver reports to the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It has sought to pretend and claim to the community at large that nothing is changing, that something is being added to the present structure for the protection of human rights, but that nothing is being taken away and that it is business as usual as far as the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and  Mr Grassby  are concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It seems ludicrous to me that we are setting up the Human Rights Commission and that part and parcel of that Commission will be the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act under which the person holding the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations is to work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I am giving my total support to this amendment because I believe it is necessary, if we are to have Human Rights Commission and if we are to maintain the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations, that the Commissioner have a vital role to play on that Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* If the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill are passed, that valuable body of experience, going back many years, will be embodied only in the person of the Commissioner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* However, if somebody else were to be appointed to that position, I must say that I think that person, if he were a person of great integrity and great capacity, probably would want to think twice about taking a position which potentially was of such subservience as these Bills, the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, would reduce it to.

* I believe that the support which both sides of the Parliament gave to the original <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act indicates that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I believe that the support given to it in its eventual form by distinguished former Liberal senators, such as the late Ivor Greenwood, and the way in which he linked the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act with the first statutory reference to the International Covenant, indicate the seriousness with which honourable senators on this side of the Parliament have regarded the problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It has been stressed each year that lack of resources in personnel and finance have made it impossible to make the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 and its provisions widely known and more readily accessible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice against the Aboriginal community appears to be more of an issue in recent years is quite simply because Aboriginal people have attempted in recent years to assert and claim their proper and full rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* Last night  Senator Chipp  indicated, while reading out a list of the hatred and filth pedlars in this community, that there are groups at work in the community and throughout the political framework whose objective is simply to promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I direct the attention of honourable senators to those criticisms- the criticism that the Commissioner is placed under the control of the Human Rights Commission, that complaints will not be as easily handled by the Commissioner in the future, that he will be subject to directions that his access to staff will be reduced, that his report to Parliament will disappear and that his role in promoting an understanding and a public awareness of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination matters will also disappear.

* To bring about a situation in which a Commissioner for Community Relations whose prinicipal job will be to warn Australia about and to monitor in Australia the activities of those who would promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and division in this country is a matter that requires attention.

* He is aware, this Government is aware and the Labor Government was aware of the necessity to ensure that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia is treated as the sort of community disease that it is and that actions are taken in order to prevent the spread of the disease and to excise the cancer of the disease whenever that is possible.

* I think it is fair to say that if the Government was considering these questions afresh and was entirely able to develop its own blueprint for a Human Rights Commission and a human rights approach, it would be doubtful whether it would actually create a statutory position of a commissioner of human relations as has been created by the Labor Government under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act.
