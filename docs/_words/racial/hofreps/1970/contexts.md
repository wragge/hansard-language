* The second matter to which I draw the attention of the House with regard to this Bill is that in the gathering of powers conferred upon this Parliament there is absolutely nothing which gives to this Parliament an explicit right to legislate upon the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination.

* I reiterate that much can be gained by the passage of this Bill, bearing in mind the necessary modifications that we of the Opposition will outline, not only by Australia as a nation showing itself to be mature enough to tackle the problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but also by each individual who has for so long been disadvantaged by the sad deficiencies in our present system.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* Fourth, the Bill proposes that there should be fostered- and I believe that this is very important- programs of education and research and other programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic groups. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* Well, I think there is evidence to show that, if anything, legislation that outlaws <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has had some effect in countries where it exists, such as in Canada and in the United States of America where the Constitution is being used to outlaw it.

* If we reject all theories of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or inferiority, if we genuinely believe that the only differences between the peoples of the world are physical, cultural and environmental differences then we must ask ourselves why it is that <span class="highlight">racial</span> antagonism still exists in today's society.

* So it is that all Aborigines are branded with inherent <span class="highlight">racial</span> characteristics and inherent patterns of social behaviour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* In other words, every person in the community of a <span class="highlight">racial</span> ethnic national group should be very careful when he or she makes any statement or exerts any pressure in the community that he does not say anything which will have an effect out of proportion to the group's numbers in the community.

* I do not know whether I can convince them that they are wrong but I genuinely believe that legislation used with discrimination, not used with the mailed fist, can be the framework for the next great push in Australia to eliminate racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination.

* There is a difference of opinion in this House on this legislation but it is not a difference of opinion regarding the abhorrence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; it is rather a difference of opinion as to the best method by which the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in our society can be handled.

* I know that there will be some on the Government side who will immediately say that the Opposition is speaking with 2 voices, that on the one hand we say that we are against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but on the other hand we want so to emasculate the Bill that it will not be possible for any effective steps to be taken against the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in our society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* In our society there is a very strong body of opinion- it was given eloquent expression by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)that  we will not lessen the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by passing fairly stringent laws about it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* I know that they have been successful, but I would ask the Government to consider the fact that, while there is a problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia, there are significant differences between the problem that we have and the problem experienced in the United Kingdom. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* One of the great difficulties about this legislation, because it is to have Australia-wide application, is that while there are serious problems in certain areas of Australia there are large areas of Australia where legislation in the form proposed by the Government could be quite inappropriate, for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  and others, particularly as it is a first go at some kind of legislative proscription of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* Let me hasten to say here and now that the whole idea behind this Bill- the prevention of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination- must be supported, but the manner in which these clauses have been drafted and the hidden meaning that appears to me to be behind them could spell disaster for many an innocent citizen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I know the argument that an act of inciting <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is in some respects more despicable than individual acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, because the presence of intent by a person who incites an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination can hardly be called in to question whereas the intent of a person who commits an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination- certainly some of the acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as they are prescribed in the language of this legislation- may not be quite the same malicious intent as that of the person who incites. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* But, that notwithstanding, the Opposition feels that the penalty or the consequences for inciting an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination ought still to be civil matters and that they ought to follow the pattern which the Opposition has endeavoured to establish with its other amendments to the procedures to follow complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I ask the Attorney-General to contemplate the situation that could arise where, in plain language, there is a racially bigoted estate agent and a perfectly tolerant vendor and, just because the tolerant vendor strictly speaking does not comply with the exemptions which are in clause 17, he could find himself in a most unfortunate situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* Given that the Government is going to create a category of offences in respect of the letting and sale of property, I accept that there is a very strong argument in some way to bring in principals; but the Opposition is unhappy with the possible consequences of clause 17 to people who have no thought of discriminating on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds and who could be the unwitting victims of discriminatory acts by their agents. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I recognise that there are arguments to the contrary and that where there is a mixture of reasons some might argue that it is sufficient that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination be a substantial reason. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* But the Opposition believes that it should be the dominant reason for the doing of the act so that in all the circumstances it is fair to say that the reason why a person acted in a particular way was on the ground of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I think that quite deservedly it will catch a lot of people but it will also catch some people who have unwittingly committed acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* We therefore think it is necessary in all the circumstances that there be no doubt that the reason why a person has done an act complained of is by reason of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination.

* Yesterday I spoke as strongly as I could on the fact that most <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia, I believe, comes about through inadvertence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* This is the first time that an Australian government has ever sought to tackle <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia with a law of this sort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* When one seeks to enact a law for the whole of Australia one has to realise that there are different parts of Australia- different in the sense that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination might be found to be more extensive in some parts than in others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I think one of the Opposition speakers mentioned that in Australia generally <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, where it occurred, was often inadvertent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* The amendment provides that a person who is unhappy with the conciliation process, a person who complains that he or she has been a victim of an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and feels that nothing has been achieved can go to a civil court and commence proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for any of the remedies which are set out in clause 26. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* Again, the Opposition very sincerely asks the Government to consider the sort of procedure we have in mind, which admittedly is a softer approach to the treatment of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination than that desired by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* On the one hand, there is the demand to eliminate acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* The Opposition accepts that any acts which incite <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination ought to be made unlawful, and in fact the earlier sections of this Bill do make that sort of behaviour unlawful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* Once again, this was part of the pattern of amendments put down by the Opposition which believes that acts inciting <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should attract the same types of consequences as those acts themselves.

* This legislation, seen against the background of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bills and other legislation which the Government has introduced or proposes to introduce, is designed to remove from the Queensland legislation certain discriminatory laws or certain discriminatory sections of existing laws.

* The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

* Again, we swing back to features of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill which would necessitate that if one of these Aborigines from a reserve or, to a lesser extent, one of these Torres Strait Islanders who ethnically seem to demonstrate an all-round greater ability in their original state should apply for a position in this outside world and find that because of lack of opportunity he is not up to the job and preference is given to a non-Aboriginal, immediately, under the terms of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, an employer who decides to exercise that preference is liable because of all the reasons advanced for discrimination against the appointment.

* Last week I participated in the debate on the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill- a Bill I had wanted to see introduced long before I came to this place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-0)

* I am convinced that the international pressures on that area are based primarily on strategic concepts and only secondarily on <span class="highlight">racial</span> issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33)

* I say that because <span class="highlight">racial</span> issues also exist in quite a number of other countries that are not subjected to similar pressures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33)

* Australia should plan to avoid any conflicts or frictions arising from <span class="highlight">racial</span> or national differences and while doing so should be liberal in admission to Australia of people of any race or nationality who desire to come, especially those who are suffering from reprisals or discrimination in some other country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42)

* I refer to such matters as the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, the attempts to gerrymander the electorate in order to sustain an authoritarian system of democracy; and various Constitution Bills that were knocked back by the Senate and the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Senate has amended the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill in a number of respects, the most important of which are as follows: First, the power vested in the Commissioner for Community Relations to commence legal proceedings where he is unable to effect a settlement by conciliation has been removed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* Third, offences relating to increment and the promotion of <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred that are required by the International Convention have been removed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* The Government would also have much preferred the inclusion of the offences relating to incitment and the promotion of <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred so that the requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination could have been followed more closely in Australian law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* The legislation will declare <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* The Commissioner will have power to engage in programs of education and research to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* It applies to a broader range of acts based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination than is found in overseas legislation and contains fewer exceptions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* The Opposition believes that the amendments will have the effect of replacing the blunt instrument of the Bill as originally presented with a process of conciliation and education which we believe will do a great deal more effectively to reduce the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia than would have been the case with the Bill in its original form. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* There is no doubt, as the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  said, that a common ground exists between the Government and the Opposition concerning the abhorrence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* Throughout the Australian community there are many people of good will, without <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, who do not believe that one achieves anything in a reduction of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension by passing the type of legislation that the Government originally wanted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* There are in fact a great number of people of similar good will who believe that one does nothing towards reducing the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension by legislative coercion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* It was for that reason, and not because of any reluctance to oppose <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, that the Opposition moved the amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* The problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions in the United Kingdom are vastly different from problems of the same nature in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* There is no posturing about the Opposition's attitude towards the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* As my colleague has stressed, we are as much against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as anybody in the land but we believe that the original proposals put forward by the Government were perhaps a little bit too enthusiastic in some areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* As my colleague has said, our attitude was engendered by a genuine desire to bring about a reduction in that little bit of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice which was not inadvertent and, as the honourable member for Bennelong said, we rejected the blunt instrument approach. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* I think that it is a step forward in bringing about a realisation within the total Australian society that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, which I firmly believe is largely inadvertent, should not be countenanced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* A lot of people are opposed to a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* I personally believe that a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Act, as this will now become, embodying as it does the aspirations of our society for attitudes that ought to exist between individuals in the society will, in the end, promote the proper relationship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38)

* Apart from the normal criteria which apply to any intending entrant to Australia, the only other criterion used to decide which South Africans will be granted entry visas into Australia is that they should not be entering as members or representatives of sporting teams, cultural or other organisations selected or structured on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis.

* To summarise the terms of the Convention, States Parties thereto declare that Apartheid is a crime against humanity and that acts resulting from the policies and practices of Apartheid and similar policies and practices of <span class="highlight">racial</span> segregation and discrimination are crimes violating the principles of International Law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and constituting a serious threat to international peace and security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-15)

* But surely in the interests of <span class="highlight">racial</span> harmony and of the acceptance of the Government's program- it involves expenditure in excess of $3 5m- of the acceptance of the program of housing these people in the cities, it would be wise not to flutter a flag which could initiate or awaken racism which may be nonexistent or dormant in the minds and hearts of white people.
