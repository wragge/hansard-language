## Contexts in which the word **naturalisation** was used in the Senate during the 1970s

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0)

* There is no doubt that we will get a considerable number of people whose political opinions or activities will be concerned with policies of the left, but I trust that the Government will not impose upon them the same penalties in connection with <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> that have been imposed upon the people who have lived in Australia for 19 years and who, because of activities with left wing parties or involving left wing policies, have been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>.
