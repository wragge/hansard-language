### Sample sentences:

* It is the sort of organisation which has written on its walls, 'Lesbianism is beautiful', and 'The family is <span class="highlight">woman</span>'s bondage'.

* It is our duty, our responsibility and our privilege to secure for every Australian man, <span class="highlight">woman</span> and child the quality of life that will result in achieving, or at least may help people to achieve, a way of life of their own choice but of an intellectual, material and spiritual quality, if you wish, that is not discriminatory of anyone in any way, and I do commend that to honourable senators.

* If there is currently no vacancy on the Appeals Tribunal in Queensland, will the Minister consider the appointment of a <span class="highlight">woman</span> when there is a vacancy in the future?

* I ask the Minister: Cannot the Australian Government at least lay a wreath on her grave, if not make a contribution towards giving a decent grave to this <span class="highlight">woman</span> who left Australia a better place than she found it?

* That is not the situation and, as a result of the lack of child care facilities and, now, the necessity for a <span class="highlight">woman</span> to be really ill before she can use up her sick leave credits as well, we will see women returning to the work force, because they need to hold their jobs, before they are properly fit to do so, or have been able to make really satisfactory arrangements for their small babies.
