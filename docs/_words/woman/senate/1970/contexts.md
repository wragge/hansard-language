* This idea was based, of course, on the fact that if a <span class="highlight">woman</span> has to take a full time job and has to take the full family responsibilities that she might have if she did not hold a job she would be discouraged from having children because children would be a burden to her and would be a burden to the family.

* That Bill providedand we have put into law- that the contribution of the <span class="highlight">woman</span> in the home ought to be considered a contribution to the family economy and ought to be considered as some sort of contribution to the assets of a family and, in the case of marital breakdown, a <span class="highlight">woman</span> should have a claim as of right to have the assets assessed on the basis of the job that she has done.

* If it is good enough to make certain property considerations for and to give certain recognitions to a <span class="highlight">woman</span> at the point of divorce, it is good enough- and it is certainly quite urgent- that we consider doing that at the point of death of the spouse. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0)
