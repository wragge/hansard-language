* This condition led to further hardship a few years later when the West Australian Supreme Court held that a young Australian <span class="highlight">woman</span> who was domiciled in Australia and had married a Malaysian in Penang in a Muslim ceremony could not, upon her return to Australia after the marriage broke down, invoke the jurisidiaion of the court to dissolve the marriage.

* There is, and has been I think, an impetus in different parts of this legislation to establish circumstances in which a <span class="highlight">woman</span> whose marriage has broken down must go out to work to look after herself if she is fit and able to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* I believe that a family court should take into consideration circumstances which have been traditional and which still are present through much of our community, that a <span class="highlight">woman</span> who gets married expects to be looked after by her husband and, even if the marriage breaks down, expects still to have some right to the protection of the law and some right to be looked after by the person she married at an earlier time.

* Part of the atmosphere of support that has been generated for this Bill has been among those who have felt in the past that our laws have presumed far too much, and that to far too great an extent the only role for a <span class="highlight">woman</span> in marriage is the traditional role of a wife and the bringing up of children.

* As I see it, in no way does this amendment destroy some of the other objectives of the Bill so far as maintenance is concerned, but I think the amendment does bring back to the Bill, certainly so far as the principles to be applied by the Court are concerned, a much needed balance so that we do have, hopefully, something approaching the ideal situation where, if a <span class="highlight">woman</span> does opt for the traditional role of a wife and a mother on a completely full time basis, she should not in any sense be at a disadvantage.

* If the purpose of clause 43 is to state the broad principles which ought to be applied by the Family Court in exercising its jurisdiction, and if we are to include any principles in that, surely there ought to be room for the expression of the principle that there is a need to protect a <span class="highlight">woman</span> within marriage who, in the exercise of choice, opts for the full time wife or mother role.

* I also pose the question: What if the husband establishes grounds for divorce, albeit that there may be in normal circumstances a general desire on the part of the <span class="highlight">woman</span> to continue her role as a wife and mother but on other occasions she may so break that role as to occasion proper grounds for divorce.

* While it could be argued, as the AttorneyGeneral undoubtedly will argue, that for example a <span class="highlight">woman</span> who has taken action against her husband has merely helped him in time of sickness and so on, one does have to draw a distinction in terms of the interpretation of 'living separate and apart' in clause 49 and the provision in sub-clause (2) relating to the rendering of some household service to the other party.

* But there also ought to be an element that takes account of the position of a <span class="highlight">woman</span> who believes that a <span class="highlight">woman</span>'s role is to be a wife and mother and who believes that that is an adequate role for a <span class="highlight">woman</span> in Australian society.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* I want the Committee to remember that of the widows pensions that the Government pays over half are paid not to de jure widows but to notional widows- that is, to separated and divorced women- it is the availability of this pension which makes this amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Fraser)  so much desired, because what is happening is that only a small subvention from the husband or the ex-husband will be capable of keeping a <span class="highlight">woman</span> in domestic circumstances rather than sending her out to work, as the pension will be available also. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* As a matter of practicality I think it is very often for a <span class="highlight">woman</span> not a choice between part time work and full time work but a choice between full time work or no work, and that will, of course, affect her aligibility for the widows pension. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* But beyond these practical aspects I think it is very desirable, because it does add something to the whole tone of this clause and makes clear, as surely we want to make clear, that an elderly <span class="highlight">woman</span> whose marriage has broken up should not have to go out to full time work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* Let us remember that, in the nature of things, there will be many cases where an elderly <span class="highlight">woman</span> is deserted without just cause by a husband of similar age who is able to find a young partner, whereas the <span class="highlight">woman</span> would have the same capacity to do so.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* The proposal before the Committee is to put emphasis on the position of the <span class="highlight">woman</span> who wants to commit herself to the marriage, and to make it quite clear that what we said with regard to clause 41 we really mean, so that when the question of maintenance comes up the <span class="highlight">woman</span> who does want to commit herself as a mother and a wife will be taken into consideration and will not be treated as a second-class citizen, a deprived person, a person who has to be considered for social services in this country.

* Where an abortion was necessary to protect such a <span class="highlight">woman</span>'s life, she would be eligible to obtain a gynaecological procedure resulting in the termination of pregnancy in a hospital standard ward at no cost to her, the cost being shared equally between the Commonwealth and State governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48)

* On the other hand, the wealthy <span class="highlight">woman</span> using a clinic for the purpose of an abortion that did not conform to these criteria, a <span class="highlight">woman</span> who is seeking an abortion primarily to satisfy her own convenience, would not be eligible to receive benefits, particularly if she were privately insured.

* I regard it as an undemocratic procedure that this House of Parliament, with not one <span class="highlight">woman</span> member, with no mandate, and with no direct power in relation to abortions, should be asked to subvert the rightful duties of State governments elected by the majority of voters in those States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48)

* The evidence, at least in relation to one substantial clinic, is that the main reasons persons have gone to have abortions are as follows: Firstly, in 32 per cent of the cases it was felt that future plans might be impaired by a child being born to the mother; secondly, in 35 per cent of the cases it was felt that there would be additional financial strain on the rest of the family; thirdly, in 1 7 per cent of the cases it was felt that the girl concerned was too young or too immature to deal with a child; and, fourthly, that in 5 per cent of the cases the <span class="highlight">woman</span> was pregnant to a man other than her husband.

 - Mr Speaker, before dinner I was discussing the indications for abortion and indicating that if, under particular circumstances, it was conscientiously suggested that any <span class="highlight">woman</span> after full medical examination should require termination of her pregnancy, then in my view she should be entitled to have it in a properly licensed and managed clinic or hospital and she should be able to draw medical benefits for it.
