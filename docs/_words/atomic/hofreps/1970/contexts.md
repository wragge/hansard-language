[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27)

* The Opposition put the case that in 1974 it tried under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to introduce regulations that were argued and defeated in the Senate, and that somehow that is inconsistent with the Government's decision now to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to let the Ranger operation proceed.

* -The introduction of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 demonstrates in the clearest possible way that the Government has failed to take seriously the criticisms of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry of the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as a vehicle for the commercial development of uranium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* In fact, in February of this year the  Chairman  of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission wrote:  the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency Special Safeguards Implementation Report indicated that a country's agreement to subject its nuclear activities to IAEA safeguards does not necessarily assure that adequate material control and accounting measures are applied in all cases.

* The only reason the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was proposed by the Labor Government to apply to the possible Ranger project was that the preferred alternative, the more appropriate alternative, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority, was invalidated by the High Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* Not only was the Labor Government's attempt to establish the Petroleum and Minerals Authority sabotaged by what is now the Government, but in 1974 when, as a substitute for the PMA, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy sought to use regulations made under section 38 ( 1 ) of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to licence uranium mining, these regulations were disallowed by the Senate Opposition majority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* Again, the same people who now occupy the Government benches in the Senate and who will be expected to support this Bill, in 1974 condemned and vetoed the use of provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* Clause 10 of the Bill would amend section 38 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to extend and strengthen the Minister's power to regulate and control the rnining, processing, possession, transportation, use and disposal of uranium and related and associated minerals or other substances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* The fact is that the Senate left the Minister no alternative to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission acting under the direction of the Minister as provided under section 19 to control the Ranger project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* The effect was that because the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission became the agent of the Government in the Ranger venture, the full security provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, including powers under the approved Defence Projects Protection Act, came to apply to any exploitation of Ranger uranium.

 Mr Deputy Speaker, I can hardly believe that the amendments proposed in this Bill to sections 34 and 38 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act come from the same people who in opposition, only four years ago, sought to destroy the Whitlam Government's initiatives which would have enabled Commonwealth control over mineral developments.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0)

* The whole concept of using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should have been scrapped and we should have left it alone as a research Act, an Act governing a research institution, and established a commercial mining Act so that at least the work force and the people involved with uranium mining were not subject to the kinds of penal provisions and draconian security measures incorporated in the present <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0)

* Whilst the Minister is not on record as saying that Pancontinental Mining Ltd, Queensland Mines Ltd or Noranda Australia Ltd will be subject to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, nevertheless, if what the Minister euphemistically calls his 'sequence' takes place and another rnining venture is given the right to mine under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, what could happen is that not only would Ranger come under the provisions of this Act, but also Queensland Mines, Noranda and others could come under its provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0)

* I concede that many people who adopt an anti-uranium stance do so ibr honourable reasons, just as many people who take an anti-uranium stance do so for quite mischievous reasons which bring benefits to the providers of other energy sources and which, of course, assist the Russian bloc, which is a great user of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power, to the disadvantage of the Western bloc countries- the free nations of the world- which seek to use our uranium.
