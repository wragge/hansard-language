* So much has it been unwilling to accept the advice of its scientists on the National Radiation Advisory Committee and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee that in order to remove the necessity of having to listen to their advice it has abolished those 2 bodies and is reforming them, leaving off those scientists who do not give it information of a politically satisfactory nature.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0)

* Has this Government thought that by the time we may have got around to this- not having done any homework at all and not having, I suspect, even consulted the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in Australia and certainly having no blueprint- and that by the time we had got another of these expensive situations like the natural gas pipeline but which will be twelve times as dear, the world supply probably will be in glut?

* The object of the Act and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of uranium as to its use in the production of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject.

* Because of the exploration that is required, because of the investigations in the field of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, because of the technical developments and because of the development of breeder reactors, it is fairly well and fairly certainly recognised that the market for uranium will exist for a relatively short period.

* The implications of the amendments to <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and Approved Defence Projects Act for civil liberties are frightening and without precedent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* General objections to the mining of uranium or to the movement into the nuclear fuel cycle aside, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill is a most unsatisfactory piece of legislation to use as a vehicle for Government policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Accordingly, we are proposing amendments to sections 1 7 and 34 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which will substantially broaden the basis of the Act and clearly authorise the participation of the Australia <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in the Ranger Project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Government has clearly acknowledged that the purpose of this amending legislation to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is commercial. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It has tacked this commercial purpose or objective on to the principal Act, that is the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953, which incorporates all the sweeping defence powers which the Commonwealth can assert for itself.

* In both the statement of the Prime Minister at that time and in introducing this legislation, the Government has rejected the recommendation of the Fox commission that it would be wrong to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953 for this purpose. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* When we delve back into the history of what happened just 44 months ago it is more than a little ironic that today the Liberal and National Country Parties should attempt to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953 as the vehicle to cany their uranium mining policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* On 19 September 1974, the Senate disallowed regulations proclaimed under the 1953 <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to provide the basis for uranium mining in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Prescribed substances are uranium, thorium and, I think, any substance containing any of the elements with an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weight above 93-  -and minerals mined or otherwise recovered in pursuance of an authority under this section that are not otherwise the property of the Commonwealth are, by force of this section, vested in the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That is the 1953 Act-  - and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of uranium as to its use in the production of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In making that statement  Senator Durack  clearly rejected the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for any purpose other than defence purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Twenty-one of the Liberal Party and National Country Party senators who in 1974 disallowed regulations made under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953 on the grounds inter alia that it was quite improper to use an Act which was primarily a defence Act, or associated with the defence powers of the Commonwealth, for commercial purposes, presumably will all support a Bill which will do precisely that.

* If they had wanted to protest against the infringement of States' rights or, more importantly in my view, the gross and scandalous infringements of the rights of the individual and the denial of the most fundamental principles of AngloAustralian jurisprudence, they should have started protesting 25 years ago about the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* For the reasons I have stated with regard to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the defence powers of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* My basic and overwhelming objection to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the amending Bill which is before us is that they will allow uranium mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In answer to comments made earlier by  Senator Colston,  the sort of country which might do that would be the country which wanted to make an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb but could not get any uranium any other way.

* Criticism was made today about the fact that we are amending the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, because on a previous occasion we did not support a Labor Bill to amend the Act in this place.

* The other night when I was watching television I saw a previous  chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission,  Sir Philip  Baxter, applying himself to a different aspect of this whole problem of nuclear power which, at its fullest projection, will decide the fate of mankind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* We are still using the term <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, when on all other occasionsexcept in this amending Bill which is the hidden clout in the Act- every other reference is to nuclear power.

* As our society believes that any progress involves a certain degree of risk, we're going to weigh that risk by asking one basic question: whether the problem of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste has brought us to the threshold of our ability to manage our own plant.

* The first Bill, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, flies in the face of recommendations from the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, but the Government has decided to use this as an instrument by which the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission can buy into the Ranger project and thus we can keep faith with the Memorandums of Understanding that were laid down by the Whitlam Government.

* Secondly, we regard the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 as being totally inappropriate to control commercial or civil uranium mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- the report of  Mr Justice  Fox which  Senator Collard  clearly has not read or has disposed of in his mind as being a totally irrelevant document- stated that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 should not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Opposition believes that, in spite of that injunction from  Mr Justice  Fox, the Government wants to continue to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for two specific reasons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The first reason is that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which dates from 1953, contains specific provisions based on the defence power which will offer the Government a means of intimidating and suppressing public opposition to uranium mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I point out that the Fox report objected to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act on quite specific grounds. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I remind honourable senators again that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is based on the defence power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Thirdly, we believe that there could be a very real conflict of interest- the Fox Commission pointed this outbetween the entrepreneurial or commercial activities of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and its responsibilities under the Act to supervise local environmental protection measures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Section 47 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which is not being amended by the current amendments and which will stand in relation to the commercial operations at Ranger, is particularly damaging in the context of the erosion of civil liberties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Further, the use of section 44 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which relates to communication of restricted information with intent to prejudice defence, contravenes Articles 18, 19 and 21 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, which deal with freedom of speech and assembly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The contradictions between section 44 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act being applied to a commercial development and the Covenant are striking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* On the one hand, the Covenant proclaims these basic rights of speech and freedom, whilst, on the other hand, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as it is applied to Ranger would impose a penalty of 20 years imprisonment for a person communicating certain aspects of the Ranger development to the public. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Further, section 60 which applies to the application of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1 947 to any works carried out by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and therefore including Ranger, effectively prevents any speechwriting or strike action in opposition to works undertaken by the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The terms of section 60 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act make it clear that the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act provisions apply to any works of the Commission without the need for the gazettal which is otherwise required by section 3 of the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Finally, these objections which I raise to sections of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which will be used in relation to uranium mining at Ranger clearly illustrate the contradictory stand on civil liberties by the Government and the use of extreme powers, which were employed in the Cold War period of the 1 940s, with respect to a commercial development in the late 1970's.

* The third point that I make about the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is that it certainly appeared from the detailed discussion at the Estimates Committee, which I do not here rehearse with any elaboration, that the Australian Safeguards Office is a complete farce and charade.

* On 25 August 1977 the Government announced its policy to develop the uranium ore deposits in the Ranger project area on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding of October 1975 which provided for mining to be undertaken under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd as joint venturers.

* The Government of course, also believes that the holders of an authority under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should not be disadvantaged in respect of such an important matter as security of tenure in comparison with prospective competitors.

* Essentially, the Bill deals with section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, the section under which an authority to mine uranium is granted by the Minister for Trade and Resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* The third consequence of the legislation is that, as far as assignments of interests are concerned, the 1974 memorandum of understanding gave pre-emptive weight to the right to purchase, in the case of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission's interest, to Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd; and in the case of Peko 's interest, to EZ, and vice versa.

* This is an important area because at present, as the Ranger venturers have pointed out that under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act there is no provision whatsoever for adequate security of tenure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* I believe that the introduction of these amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act amounts to an admission by the Government of how inappropriate this Act is as the legislative framework for the development and exploitation of uranium within Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* This conclusion of mine is not simply something to be deduced from the provisions of the Bill; it is quite explicit in the admission by the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony),  in his second reading speech in another place where he says, of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, that provisions to cover mining on a commercial basis were never included. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* That disenchantment with the Minister in another place is understandable because, as I say, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is quite inappropriate as as vehicle for the exploitation of mining of uranium for peaceful purposes and for commercial profit.

* I would go further and say that not only is the legislative framework as a whole inappropriate and totally inadequate to deal with the situation but also that the decision of the Government to continue using this Act in the face of the admitted inadequacy alerts us to a possible further reason for maintaining the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as the legislation governing the development of the Ranger project.

* As the Government pointed out in August 1978, there is a need for the Commonwealth to share a proportion of the cost in developing the Ranger uranium deposits to which  Senator Tate  has referred this afternoon and that these funds would be raised by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission through borrowings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0)

* the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow monies from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and to give security and issue securities in respect of borrowings other than from the Commonwealth, to enable the Treasurer to guarantee repayment by the Commission of monies- borrowed other than from the Commonwealth- and to provide that where securities are issued by the Commonwealth, repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0)

* Because of these energy gaps, because of the need for Australia to play its part in supplying uranium, and because of the need for us to back up the safeguards laid down by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  soon after we came into power, it has been necessary for us again to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act so as to allow the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to play its part as a commercial partner with the other two partners in the Ranger consortium, Whilst we are hearing criticism from the Opposition today, this Government is merely applying those safeguards and making the Act efficient so that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission can become an efficient partner.

* Given the present circumstances in Australia, given the high capital cost of the nuclear industry and given the scarcity of trained scientific workers in this field, the type of operation we are running at the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at the present time from a management point of view is the best that we can do.
