* It is in no small measure due to the quadrupling of oil prices that a threat is posed to the economic viability and foreign exchange reserves of some of the world's major industrial powers, which have complacently relied on unlimited cheap oil imports, and have ignored research and development of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas, coal, and ultimately <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and solar energy.

* I ask the Minister to deny that or at least get one of the Government speakers to deny that the Government will not permit any company in Australia even to extract a bulk specimen of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4)

* In the course of this debate I will refer simply to the necessity to obtain a licence from the Minister before anybody anywhere in Australia, whether it be in a Territory or in a State, can work a mine or even do any exploratory work for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or acquire, produce, possess or dispose of ore bearing <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The object of the Act and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as to its use in the production of atomic weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The Act itself was coloured by views as to the great strategic importance of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* In effect, the Act gives to the Commonwealth the property in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> anywhere in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* He pointed out in the explanatory note which accompanied the regulations that there have been significant discoveries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, in recent years and because of its economic and strategic importance the Government is concerned that the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in Australia should be undertaken on a coherent and rational basis and with due regard to developments in the world market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* As I said, the way in which the Minister purports to carry out that policy is simply to pass these regulations which say virtually that no one can touch <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or do anything with it without a licence from the Minister for Minerals and Energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* For many years <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has not been free of legal rules and restraints. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Companies have explored for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* They are well known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines that have existed in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* But all the companies that have explored for, found and developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines have done so under well recognised, well known and well established mining laws under either the Mining Ordinance of the Northern Territory or State mining laws. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* We are not questioning in any way the proposition that there ought to be control over the right to mine and the way in which one mines <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, or indeed any other mineral. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Moreover, the Commonwealth Government has adequate powers in regard to the national interest as far as mining, including the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is concerned under its export control powers generally and under regulations that have been made under those powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Those powers are quite adequate and they relate specifically to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act to which I have referred. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* He stated that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in Australia should be vigorously and promptly exploited for defence and industrial purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The Atomic Energy Commission had been set up to supervise generally the prospecting for and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and so forth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* His  purpose was to encourage private enterprise to explore the mineral resources of the Northern Territory and, one might also add, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mineral resources throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* As a result of exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> over the years under titles which had been obtained under State and Northern Territory mining laws great reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have been found. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* In fact, they have been found to such an extent that they represent probably 20 to 25 per cent of the world's known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It is pretty clear that there is vast potential in Australia for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* In fact, with encouragement by the Government there could be a much greater increase in Australia's known reserves and there would be if we had a government which encouraged and which did not inhibit- as seems to be the negative policy of the present Minister and the Government- the exploration for and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> energy resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The reason given by the Government as to why it wants these powers is to plan a coherent and rational policy for the development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* We in Opposition are not seeking to take away proper government control and supervision of mining for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I have emphasised that adequate laws already exist in the Northern Territory and in the States under which people and companies seeking to explore for and to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> must obtain exploration licences and licences to develop mines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Under the regulations, despite the title one may have acquired under the State or Territory laws, now he will not be able to work a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine or effectively carry out exploration with a licence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* If one drills a hole and gets some substance containing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> one will be in possession of it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* If, in the Government's eyes, one happens to be unlucky enough to obtain a successful drill hole and to be in possession of some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> one will not be able to dispose of it without the licence of the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* He is able to come in and take over complete control not only of the development and working of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine but also the exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It hardly seems to be necessary to provide a control on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because clearly the Government already has that control, as I have indicated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* At least that would give the Government some sort of powers in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which, apparently, the Government would not have over minerals generally throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It is this: The Senate will remember that just prior to this time it became clear that Queensland Mines Ltd held a relatively small but very rich deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory on an Aboriginal reserve, in an area likely to be designated as a national park. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The difficulty which the Government faced and still faces in relation to this policy regarding Queensland Mines is that long before the policy was established and long before the Woodward Committee was set up Queensland Mines obtained titles to explore for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which it found at Nabarlek. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It had entered into contracts with overseas purchasers in relation to its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Of course, the Government was also in a rather embarrassing position as a result of the fact that at that stage the company could not mine the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and could not fulfil its contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* So the Government conceived the idea that the way out of this problem for the Government I suppose it was not such a good way out for the company- was to give Queensland Mines Ltd access to other deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which were the subject of exploration by other companies under other titles and rights to explore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* As a result of their exploration initiative and great expenditure of money, those companies had found other deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The company that was to be the bunny in this exercise was Peko-Wallsend EZ which had found large deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a place known as Ranger in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* He stated that the Commonwealth felt that it would authorise the access to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> desposits owned by the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It is now trying to dress up its action in these grandiose terms by stating that the purpose of this regulation is to have a coherent and rational plan for Australia's national resources, in this instance its reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* What could be more likely to inhibit any search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It has found a very large deposit- approximately 100,000 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. Perhaps it is not of the highest grade, but it is a very economic deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I was up there recently and it is very clear that there is a great <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit in that area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* There are other significant deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in and about this area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It is quite clear that a great <span class="highlight">uranium</span> province has been discovered there. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* But this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been discovered only because of the incentive which had been given to exploration by the Liberal-Country Party coalition government over the years it was in office, together with the assurance that if a company did take the risks and spent millions of dollars on this enterprise, such a company would then receive a title to mine and develop the fruits of its exploration and initiative. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I hope that when the Minister replies today he will indicate, though I doubt that he will be able to do so, that this Government has a policy in relation to the exploration for minerals and attempts to increase our known energy reserves and in particular, of course, our reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with which we are concerned in this debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* As I have said, the regulations appear to be designed to establish the Federal Minister for Minerals and Energy as the one and only authority in Australia to control the whole area of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining from the exploration right through to the development of the deposits. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Before the suspension of - the sitting I had turned to the question of the Opposition 's policy in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The Government seems to be groping at the moment for some sort of policy for the redevelopment of the Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine, but that is a very small mine and represents a special problem. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* What we would expect to see is some broad positive policy from the Government in regard to the need to expand our exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the upgrading and increasing of what are already very significant reserves of it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* We also believe that part and parcel of such an interest in the development of and exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be to permit some reasonable export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide or the ore in its yellow cake form. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* To make sure that the Act is extended in the fashion he desires, he has given comparisons with other countries that are leaders in the free enterprise system in the world and which have similar, if not greater, powers in relation to the possession, use and regulation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in their national interests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The documents which I have, and which no doubt are available in the Parliamentary Library, indicate that the United States of America and Canada have very strict controls residing in their national governments for the sort of management of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources that the Australian Minister is seeking here.

* Certainly I am suspicious, especially following their introduction by the Government, of the motives behind a number of Government moves, but in seeking to regulate the production and usage of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources the Minister would be doing no more than  Senator Durack  has asked, and that is that there should be limited exports under strict conditions which are subject to the national interest of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* So there has to be some vision of Australia's future fuel and power needs, and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, on the assessment which we have now of Australia's fuel reserves of all forms, will probably play a very heavy part at around the turn of the century or thereafter in the supply of Australia's power needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* But the Minister has not produced any definite plan for the development of minerals in general in Australia and of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in particular. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I notice that  Senator Durack  did not read much of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy put out by his leader because there is nothing much in it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Nowhere in any argument from either side so far can I see any real statement of Australia's future needs for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an energy source. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* So where is the policy which will provide the long term management of Australia's fuel resources and provide for the power that will come from Australia's own <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I think it is so reasonable that this regulation should be defeated and should remain defeated until the Government can produce its plans until those who have taken the initiative and found Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources know what is in store for them and know what proportion of their finds are economic to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I would like to read to the Senate the brief details of the Canadian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Each mining company will have a reserve margin for domestic supply allocated to it by a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Resource Appraisal Group within the Energy Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* This margin would be based on the 'ratio of each company's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources to the total Canadian recoverable resources from all such companies estimated by the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Appraisal Group'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* There are some big deals cooking about Australia 's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and this Government does just the opposite to getting its policy into the open at this particular time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I wonder whether a certain amount of bait has been held out to the Senate, to the Parliament and to the mining companies in general to obtain general approval of this ordinance, because the Minister has been making public statements about the setting up in Australia of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* South Australia's interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> dates from World War II when  Sir Marcus  Oliphant, the present Governor of South Australia, advised the United Kingdom Government to spend funds on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration in South Australia, where the only deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> then known in Australia were located. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The results led to the establishment of the Radium Hill mining project in 1954, producing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide yellow cake from the United States-United Kingdom combined development agency over a period of 7 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The concurrent active participation in the search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by the Commonwealth Government resulted in the establishment of the [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* All these early <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts terminated about 1964 as a result of stockpile sufficiency and lower cost supplies being available chiefly from Canada in respect of the United States and United Kingdom markets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Notable in this era was the South Australian Government's establishment of the research laboratories, now called the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories, which became the recognised authority for the investigation and design of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction processes which were incorporated in all the early <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining plants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Therefore, we in Australia and particularly in South Australia have an early history of initiation and honorable development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> discovery and its development to the marketable stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* If it is possible environmentally and for other physical reasons to have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia, South Australia would certainly like to share in its development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Consistent with its Party platform, on the basis of which it was elected to office in 1972 and reconfirmed in that office last May, the Labor Government lays great emphasis on the need to approach the development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in an orderly and coherent manner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* There are other precedents around the world illustrating to the industry that something is expected of it in relation to Australia's future needs for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It must scan what other countries have done in their national interest in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development and must suggest methods whereby the industries in Australia can be involved in a viable, economic mining enterprise and still work within the national interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* It seems to me that it is totally unnecessary in the case of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry- as in the case of many other mineral and petroleum industries- that in order to have proper measures of control, with which none of us would disagree, it should be suggested somewhat sinisterly that controls and ownership are synonymous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I do not believe that in order properly to control the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> availability and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in this country it is necessary to literally own it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* This is the situation we find today when many companies, particularly in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> area, are unable to operate from a research and developmental point of view and unable to continue drilling in this extremely important exploit area, purely because they have no licence through regulations which are part of the Atomic Energy Act and which are related to security situations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I believe that at this time the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has probably never been higher. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Today the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is such that we have a sellers market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Back in the 1950s it was a sellers market in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the world price was high. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Because of the exploration that is required, because of the investigations in the field of atomic energy, because of the technical developments and because of the development of breeder reactors, it is fairly well and fairly certainly recognised that the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will exist for a relatively short period. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* Indeed, there is more reason for our using our capacity to develop our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources at this time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* With a high price for the product, we could find ourselves in a situation where many <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits suddenly became economic areas of exploitation, deposits which at many other times certainly would not be economic to exploit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The uncertainty which has developed in the mining industry, particularly in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, because of this indecisive situation is unfortunately quite widespread in the Australian community today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* There seems to be some sort of concern on the part of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  that Australia should do nothing about this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> situation prior to the establishment of an enrichment plant in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* The fact is that in Japan and the United States of America, the chief markets for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> of which we have such great supplies, there is an extremely cool attitude towards Australia exporting the enriched product. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* There is ample power of control in this country without denying companies the right to research and develop areas which can be developed as part of this important <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0)

* I say that without any apology because when we talk about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we know only too well that what happened at Rum Jungle resulted in the excessive pollution of the Finniss River in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* I went to the area with  Mr Lamb,  a member of the House of Representatives, because I was concerned about uncontrolled <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production and what it can do to the Alligator River system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* The policy of the Minister for Minerals and Energy is that if we have ironclad controls over the Ranger mine there is no justification for any of the other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining ventures going into the Top End National Park in the Northern Territory.

* I think we all agree that <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, because of the excessive dangers of the waste and even the secondary waste, must be controlled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* I say this quite candidly: If we have unused sources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and solar energy comes into being with less destruction of the environment, then I think it is sound policy to develop the latter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* The debate in which we are engaged concerns a motion to disallow certain regulations; but it has ranged over a much wider area, seemingly embracing not only the Government's policies in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but also, as one honourable senator said, our total approach to the world energy crisis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* Who would deny the need for the Australian Government to keep complete control in the years ahead of our vital resources, especially <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* I turn to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment about which something was also said. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* He asked for information about the Government's policy in respect of such matters as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* The honourable senator will find on page 49 and subsequent pages what the Commission is doing in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> enrichment studies have been carried out by the Commission, in association with others, over the past year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* Such an approach demands a degree of governmental guidance which was lacking prior to December 1972, particularly in the light of the last minute approvals by the former Government of the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at unsatisfactory prices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* The greater part of the Australia-wide reserves is contained in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits of the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* The Government was reinforced in this decision by its determination to ensure that deliveries of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were made as required under the export contracts, principally with Japan, which were approved by the previous Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* To this end holders of approved contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from deposits in the Northern Territory were, earlier this year, offered access to designated deposits owned by the Commonwealth pursuant to section 35 of the Atomic Energy Act.

* In doing so that Government, through its responsible Minister in each chamber, expressed the belief that it had produced a fair and powerful piece of legislative machinery to shape the future of Australia in this important field of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and atomic energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* In other words, the Menzies Government embraced the necessity for a clear enunciation of the Crown's title to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* The position then is that no valid ground exists for the seeking of the disallowance of this regulation because it is an essential part of the legislative framework for the development of these <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* Recognising that fact and the fact that we are giving this leadership, I would have hoped that the honourable senator would support the Government in obtaining the necessary powers and ensuring that, in fact, we can exercise the needed control over the export and the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* When I talk about that, I am talking about a total lack of policy, not only along the lines on which  Senator Hall  spoke, about the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and so on, but a total lack of policy in relation to the whole ambit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining from the exploration stage through to its development and ultimate enrichment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* The companies that have over the years of the Liberal Country Party Government gone out and found reserves- very handsome reserves- of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are now facing not only the possiblity that they cannot exploit these reserves in any shape or form but also a very real possibility of the Government taking over some or all of thendeposits.

* If there is the Petroleum and Minerals Authority and if total power over utilisation of resources rests with the Minister and the total ownership rests with the Commonwealth Government, how easy it is simply to hand over the deposits of some companies to this Petroleum and Minerals Authority and allow that Authority to become the sole proprietor of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0)

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> until perfectly safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world 's energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity.

* I do not believe that any person would argue that under no circumstances should our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> be developed for a nuclear industry and exported but, at the same time, it is perfectly clear to all of us, and the Fox report makes it clear, that there are as yet unsolved problems with the disposal of waste, plutonium, accidents, war, terrorism and all the rest of the dangers.

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  as recently as 12 August this year when in London stated that we will be selling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> only to those countries which are members of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, to those countries which are agreeing to the international safeguards, and that we will be wanting to draw up bilateral trade agreements with countries to ensure that all of those requirements are met. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* If we are careful, cautious and responsible in the way in which we sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to those countries which need extra energy resources and if those countries stand by their commitment I, as one senator in this place, say that we should export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* -The decision on where, when and whether to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia and where we will go with nuclear technology in Australia is one of the most difficult decisions and difficult problems that this Parliament will have to face. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* I believe that the argument that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> means money, therefore we should rip it out of the ground and export it-rip it out and flog it off- is nonsense and immoral. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* But what is more important is that we can have a conservation of energy policy and we can have a national energy policy, which is recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- by the Fox inquiry- in recommendations 12 and 14 and which no one in this country seems to like to quote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* I would regret it if the arguments about the export of a few thousand tonnes from Mary Kathleen, which will make no difference to the world 's attitude to nuclear power and which will make no difference to the supplies which go to Japan, West Germany and the United States, should become the basis of the very real argument which  Mr Justice  Fox and the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry have brought up. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* Some of it, of course, has been well considered, and sincere people with a knowledge of the subject have supported the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> argument; but I am afraid that many of the arguments that have been put have come from people who have not considered the facts and whose aim is to stop the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at any cost. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* I must say that after listening to all the evidence it has not been difficult for me to come to a decision that we should mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that we should export it, provided that necessary and absolute safeguards that are known today are insisted upon. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* At the rate at which we will be able to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and at the projected rate to which world requirements will increase, we will be able to supply something like $3,000m of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide per annum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* When one considers that the world market price at the moment on long-range contracts is something like $30-odd per lb and the spot market price at the present time is something over $40 per lb, the profitability in mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is clear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* In the light of this information which has been supplied by the Minister I ask him how he can justify his Government's stated policy that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is needed to help overcome the energy crisis, especially as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves will not even outlive oil reserves? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0)

* Will the Government now accept the fact that there is and will continue to be an energy crisis even if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is used, and will he therefore urge the Government immediately to appropriate substantial funds to foster research into alternative energy sources?

* By using plutonium bred from <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-238 in present day thermal reactors, which rely on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-235 for their operation, FBRs will generate about 1.1 to 1.3 times more plutonium at each pass of fuel elements through the reactor.

* The breeding ratio is determined by a number of factors such as the type and physical form of the fuel used, the physical size and shape of the reactor core and its surrounding material, and the distribution of the breeding material (<span class="highlight">uranium</span>-238) in the reactor.

* Did the Minister write to the Minister for National Resources indicating his concern that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory would be obstructed by the possible national park boundaries and Aboriginal land rights claims? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0)

* I further ask: If the letter indicates that the Minister is advocating that the Federal Government break its election promises on the environment and on Aboriginal affairs in order to push ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory, does not this pre-empt any recommendations which may be made by the second report of the Fox inquiry? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0)

* During the course of the Committee's inquiry the ongoing arguments over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the development of nuclear power have resulted in solar power being promoted by anti-nuclear proponents and others as a readily available energy alternative.

* In recent times both the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and the Royal Commission on Petroleum have commented on the lack of any recognisable energy policy in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-32)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0)

* Because today is the last day of sitting of the Parliament for at least a fortnight, is it intended by the Government to have the second part of the Fox Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> report issued while the Parliament is in recess? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0)

* These are issues of major international importance in their own right, but they have an added significance for Australia because of our potential as a supplier of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* This will remain the case whether or not Australia is ultimately to become a major exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The safeguards policy which we will follow is, in our view, appropriate for any country to follow whether it be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplier or consumer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The Government fully accepts that if it were in future to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export from Australia, this would carry with it added responsibilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Against the background of these international responsibilities the Government accepts that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a special commodity, the export of which would involve important considerations of a kind not involved in the export of other commodities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* We view adequate safeguards as a fundamental prerequisite of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export which we would also expect responsible customer countries for Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> readily to accept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* It will be recalled that, following the release of the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, the Government announced in the House on 1 1 November 1 976 that it supported the Inquiry's view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The announcement of a policy at this stage, of course, in no way pre-empts a decision on the question whether any such new contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be permitted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* As the Government has repeatedly emphasised, this remains a matter for consideration following receipt of the final report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* That the Government has taken certain decisions on safeguards policy at this stage reflects its determination to ensure that an established frame-work of policy exists so that any new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports take place under the most carefully considered and responsible conditions possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The Government wishes to avoid a situation in which decisions may be required on new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing at some point in the future without the benefit of a clear policy on the ground rules to apply so far as safeguards are concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Australia is a potentially significant supplier of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but if we are to play the part which this potential gives us the opportunity to play of contributing effectively to international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, it is desirable that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries and other nuclear supplier countries alike know where Australia stands on the matter of safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In a broader sense, safeguards for future Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports would comprise, as well as the application of international safeguards in this strict sense, the securing from importing countries of adequate assurances regarding the use and control of supplied nuclear material and the conclusion of binding arrangements to give effect to such assurances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* These cover: The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; the application of effective International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Second, should the Government approve further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry it will retain the right to be selective in the countries to whom <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export will be permitted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The following minimum criteria for eligibility to receive Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will apply. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The Government emphasises that these represent minimum conditions for countries to be eligible to receive Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* We will therefore export only to nuclear weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In this respect the Government's policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Third, the Government wishes to ensure that if a decision is taken to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards from the time it leaves Australian ownership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Accordingly it will be the Government's policy that any future sales arrangements for exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be such that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be in a form which attracts full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Fourth, Australia will require the prior conclusion of bilateral agreements between the Australian Government and countries wishing to import Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under any future contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* These bilateral agreements will provide a framework for direct and binding assurances by importing countries to the Australian Government in relation to the use and control of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Australia or nuclear material derived from its use. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Australia would seek to arrange with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries regular expertlevel consultations to satisfy ourselves of the implementation of the provisions of bilateral agreements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In line with the positions taken by the United States and Canada Australia would retain the right to cease supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to any country which breached safeguards undertakings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* I have already made clear that Australia would not be prepared to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to such countries in the absence of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards applied under the NonProliferation Treaty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Sixth, the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Australia to one country, or nuclear material derived from its use, to be able to be reexported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* For this reason the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries should make any transfer of supplied material to a third party contingent on the prior consent of the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* This provision will give Australia the means of ensuring that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we supply or nuclear material derived from it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Seventh, we would require that Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied to other countries for peaceful uses not be enriched beyond 20 per cent <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-235 without prior Australian consent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In respect of this requirement also, the Government's policy extends beyond the recommendations made by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In order to effectively reserve Australia's position on this matter for the time being we would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that any reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* This requirement is additional to those recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report and reflects similar concerns to those expressed by the Inquiry in relation to reprocessing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Ninth, the Government would require in future bilateral agreements the assurance from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries that adequate physical security will be maintained on their nuclear industries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* These requirements also translate into concrete policy measures concerns expressed by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* For this reason, although the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in its first report did not make a recommendation on this matter, the Government has decided that it is desirable that, as a standard practice, a clause should be included in any future contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia noting that the transaction is subject to safeguards as agreed between the importing country and the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* It builds on the preliminary thinking of the Government described in testimony to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry last year, as well as the recommendations of the first report of the Inquiry itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries- both <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importers and major nuclear exporters- and relevant international organisations including the International Atomic Energy Agency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* As a result the Government is satisfied that the policy it has decided upon represents a practical, reasonable and effective package of safeguards measures to seek from countries wishing to import <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia under any future contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* I say that particularly in view of the fact that in the vicinity of Roxby Downs, which is not far from Woomera, there are quite considerable deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and copper.

* There is one other matter I want to raise and that is the matter of the tabling of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry Second Report in the Parliament today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0)

* It is of vital importance to the whole community that sufficient copies of this Second Report are available to the general public so that they can purchase them, see what is contained in the report and inform themselves fully as to the ramifications or otherwise of the mining and sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0)

* 1 ) In the light of the Government's stated policy that it will encourage widespread public debate on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining issue, will the Minister make public the recent court decision in West Germany which ordered the cancellation of planning permission for a nuclear power station at Whyl in West Germany. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-52-28)

* In the second half of 1977. relations between the Federal Government and the trade unions will be sorely tested by four issues; <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, wage indexation, the federal Government's industrial legislation, and the establishment of an Omega navigation station in Gippsland, Victoria.

* Also it seems that what honourable senators opposite used to consider the biggest issue before the country- namely, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue- has been washed out of their hair. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48)

* Firstly, let us realise that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue is a fait accompli. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0)

* The principal effect of not making Australian supplies available would be to make it necessary for other countries to put more effort into developing and mining known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0)

* lt was generally agreed in evidence that if Australia does not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the rest of the world in the first half of the 1980s additional <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling facilities will have to be established in other countries.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0)

* These were: the need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; the application of effective International Atomic Energy agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and re-processing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0)

* One of the strong arguments according to those who support the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia is that we have a responsibility to the rest of the world to sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0)

* First  Mr Justice  Fox found that under the procedures laid down in the Australian code of practice for the operation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, radiation from mining and milling is not such as to justify a ban on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0)

* The fifth element in the administrative arrangements the Government will put in place is the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry to establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council, responsible to the Minister for National Resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* This body will fulfil the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry for the establishment of a body with adequate representation of the people to advise the Government and with a duty to report annually to the Parliament with regard to the export and use of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The final element in the administrative arrangements is that the Government will move to establish by legislation, together with the States, a uniform code of practice to apply to all <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* It is completely in accord with the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry and will provide a proper and adequate basis on which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development will proceed so as to harmonise the interests of development, environmental protection, National Park values and Aboriginal welfare. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Memorandum of Understanding provides for the Commonwealth, through the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, to engage in a joint venture with Peko/EZ for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Ranger, beginning with the establishment of a mine of 3,300 short tons capacity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The capital is to be provided in the proportions 7216 per cent by the Commonwealth and 2716 per cent by Peko/EZ, with Peko/EZ receiving the net proceeds of sale of 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> produced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* In coming to this conclusion, the Government had regard to the view of the Ranger Inquiry that its concern over the appropriateness of the Atomic Energy Act would have less force if the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council recommendation of the Inquiry were adopted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* As I have already stated, the Government will adopt that recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry and establish a <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The decision to proceed with further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development will bring with it significant economic benefits for the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Ranger Inquiry assumed that production and sales would begin in 1981-82 at a rate of 2,000 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide increasing to 10,000 short tons in 1985-86. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Ranger Inquiry's forecasts of economic benefits concluded that, at a price level of SUS30 per lb, the addition to our national income resulting from further development of an Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry could account for more than 1.3 per cent of" projected levels of national income in the mid 1990s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Ranger Inquiry concluded that, should the higher prices assumed in its analysis be achieved, namely a price of SUS30 per lb, the export earnings of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry would eventually exceed the earnings in recent years of any of our other major export industries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Ranger Inquiry's forecasts also indicate that development of a national <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will result in the creation of considerable direct employment opportunities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* Based on the assumption that construction of the first project would commence in 1977-78, with production and sales commencing in 1981-82 at an average rate of around 2,000 short tons <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, increasing at about that rate until 1994-95 when total output would reach 27,300 short tons, the Ranger Inquiry forecast that a total workforce of between 2,000 and 2,500 would probably be directly employed in the industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The employment opportunities created by development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry will not, of course, end at the mine site. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The employment prospects would, of course be further enhanced should Australia at some future stage decide to upgrade and enrich <span class="highlight">uranium</span> prior to export. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* Consistent with this attitude we will study the feasibility of upgrading and enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, and preserve Australia's options in this regard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The joint <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment feasibility study between Australian and Japan, initiated by the Whitlam Government, will continue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Ranger Inquiry did not forecast possible levels of employment that could result from a fully integrated <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia, but a recent authoritative study by the South Australian Government, which I have previously tabled in this House, did so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* Employment opportunities, on the statistical data for the already established North American <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, would be such that a fully developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia could support directly and indirectly about 500,000 persons starting with a mining workforce of about 5000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The economic benefits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining for the Northern Territory will be particularly significant The Ranger Inquiry estimated that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations would add between $65m and $ 105m to incomes in the Territory- an increase of between 16 per cent and 26 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Ranger Inquiry concluded that:  a regional <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry producing up to 12,500 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> per year would substantially enlarge the Northern Territory 's economy and could provide the stimulus for a much faster rate of economic growth in the area than would otherwise occur. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Government will wish to consider the accrual of an appropriate share of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> profits to the public sector. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Government will therefore initiate discussions with the industry on a possible framework for a secondary or resource-based tax on future earnings from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* The Government has also decided that, as resources flow from the further development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, additional funds will be provided to increase substantially our national effort on solar energy research. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0)

* In taking its decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, the National Park, and Aboriginal land rights, the Government has been guided by the two reports of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry commissioned under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0)

* As I stated in the House of Representatives on 2 June 1977, 'the two reports taken together represent a major contribution not only to Australia but also to international understanding of the environmental consequences of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in the broadest terms as it affects mankind '. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0)

* The second finding of the Ranger Inquiry was that the hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if properly controlled and regulated, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0)

* One of the great tragedies of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate is that people are simple enough to believe that if we leave our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground and take no interest in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, then proliferation will not happen.

* I ask the Minister: As these facts sit oddly with the Labor Opposition's present stance on mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, can he confirm that the Labor Government led by  Mr Whitlam  did in fact have this quite different attitude when it was recently in office? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0)

* At a time when  Mr Dunstan  is presenting himself as the champion of anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> protesters and the champion of Aboriginal interests, the revelation that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> drilling is taking place in Aboriginal historic and sacred areas must dismay Aboriginals throughout Australia.

* Coupled with this, at Roxby Downs there is <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and some reports, though not official, have stated that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Roxby Downs could equal that in the Ranger deposits and that there is sufficient <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Roxby Downs alone, forgetting the other known deposits in South Australia, to justify the establishment of an enrichment plant in South Australia.

* In view of" the fact that there are indications that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining may be further retarded because little progress is being made and little agreement is being arrived at between people representing Aboriginal interests, mining interests, government authorities, et cetera, is it now not unlikely that the timetable for future estimates of production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> may also have to be further amended?

* 
 Mr President, this Bill, together with the related Bills which are being introduced, are a further earnest of the Government's determination that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia will be carefully controlled and proceed in a responsible manner with Full regard to the need for protection of the environment and the welfare of all Australians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* There shall be a uniform Australian code covering the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Our forthcoming involvement in the mining, milling and transport of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory underlines the need for responsible governments to have appropriate protection strategies in force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is therefore particularly important that this Bill be passed as soon as possible, in view of the imminent development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits at Jabiru, in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Their immediate application will be to regulate the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Other national codes of practice which will need to be given priority include the management of mining and milling wastes, and transport of yellow cake, in view of the Government 's policies for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> developments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Not to act to provide these measures would be irresponsible in the light of the Government's decision to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining developments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* This legislation demonstrates very clearly our determination to see that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in Australia is regulated and controlled to ensure the protection of the environment and the health and safety of Australians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government's decisions on the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry as far as they affect Aboriginal land rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0)

* A number of States are interested in the processing of yellowcake for the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-14-0)

* New sections are to be inserted after section 23 of the principal Act to empower any person authorised by the land council to obtain information and documents relating either to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region or to the applications made by the lands council to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory concerning matters affecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Then we are told that Aborigines are to have full access to information relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region but that they can use the information only in such ways as are laid down in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In that regard, it is apparent that in certain aspects of the amending legislation the Government is saying that the promotion of the processing, mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should take precedence over justice, land rights and the very principles of self-determination for the Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is my purpose to argue, therefore, that the rights of the Aborigines should take precedence over any supposed urgency of promoting a package of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We would argue that the sacrificing of the rights of Aborigines which could come about as a result of this amending legislation puts their rights at the altar of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and export. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* My attention has been drawn to the second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In practice that means that in the case of major minerals such as bauxite, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and beach sands the owner of the land has the absolute say in whether his land should be mined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It will not be a bad thing for this country that some of the enormous cash flows that 1 believe will be generated from the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry eventually will find their way into the Aboriginal communities which own these northern areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* That sort of campaign is being conducted not only in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory; it is being conducted in other places as well. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I venture to say that before this Government is many months older there will be a lot of things it will regret about its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Queensland Conservation Council urges you to oppose the passage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> packages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I say quite frankly that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ought to be left in the ground until the day we can find some safe way of disposing of the waste and using it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is obvious that the Government is determined to go ahead with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> regardless of the fact that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had a very short term life as a fuel generally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* There are lots of ways <span class="highlight">uranium</span> cannot be used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We have to remember that when <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining goes ahead it will transform the whole social and cultural aspects of the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* When the Government panicked a few weeks ago and decided that that area ought to be cleaned up all the spare <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore was shifted down to Snake Creek. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Government does not know whether the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore will damage streams in the Snake Creek area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It becomes imperative for the Government in its mad campaign to go-ahead to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to legislate for every possible safeguard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* My forecast is that there will be a time in the future when this Government will be very sorry for having gone into <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining because of the pressures applied by the transnational <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining organisations, and by certain people in the Australian community, and the fact that having been compelled to take this action in a hurry it will suffer more pangs of conscience, if it has one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I simply say that this is a Bill which gives effect to the Government's decision on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining as they affect Aboriginal land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Those decisions followed from recommendations made by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The more important amendments associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will enable the granting of Aboriginal land, which was recommended by the Ranger Inquiry as principal recommendation 5 on chapter 1 5 of the report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The amendments contained in this Bill which relate to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining are consistent with the Government's acceptance of the recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry as they relate to Aboriginal land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* As is generally known, the Australian Labor Party is opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in general, at least at this stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Even if the Opposition were not generally opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, it would still oppose these Bills, especially the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, for reasons which I shall detail later. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Our general objection to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is based on arguments which I think are fairly well known. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* There are very serious doubts about whether the guidelines laid down by the Government last year will in fact be enforced by the Government or observed by the countries to which we may ultimately sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Indeed, the policy is backed partially by the contention that the freer availability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- in particular Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- on world markets will remove the need for other countries to move into fast breeder technology. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Not only is that wrong as a matter of technical fact, but the point is that it is also a fact that conventional fission reactors using <span class="highlight">uranium</span> 238 will produce more plutonium in producing any given quantity of electricity than a fast breeder reactor would produce in producing the same quantity of electricity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* More importantly, on the matter of waste disposal I want to make this point: If the Government really believed that there was safe technology for the disposal of nuclear waste and if it wished to maximise Australian control over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which might be exported from Australia it would insist upon- not just allowthe spent fuel rods from reactors being stored in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* If that were done the only <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which would be outside our physical control would be that which is actually being used in a reactor overseas or the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which for six months after that use is in the form of rods which are being stored in the preliminary cooling process. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* General objections to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or to the movement into the nuclear fuel cycle aside, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill is a most unsatisfactory piece of legislation to use as a vehicle for Government policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Accordingly, we are proposing amendments to sections 1 7 and 34 of the Atomic Energy Act which will substantially broaden the basis of the Act and clearly authorise the participation of the Australia Atomic Energy Commission in the Ranger Project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I shall read two short quotations from the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry Second Report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That the Atomic Energy Act of 1953 not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Apart from the constraints which the Labor Government of the day faced and which this Government does not face, there was always within that Memorandum of Understanding a provision to make the Memorandum inoperative if the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> inquiry made particular recommendations and if those recommendations were accepted by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* When we delve back into the history of what happened just 44 months ago it is more than a little ironic that today the Liberal and National Country Parties should attempt to use the Atomic Energy Act of 1953 as the vehicle to cany their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* On 19 September 1974, the Senate disallowed regulations proclaimed under the 1953 Atomic Energy Act to provide the basis for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I shall quote some of the statements made by  Senator Durack  at that time about the use of the Atomic Energy Act for the purpose of providing a legal vehicle for the commercial exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I have emphasised  that  adequate laws already exist in the Northern Territory and in the States under which people and companies seeking to explore for and to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> must obtain exploration licences and licences to develop mines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* is able to come in and take over complete control not only of the development and working of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine but also the exploration for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Prescribed substances are <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, thorium and, I think, any substance containing any of the elements with an atomic weight above 93-  -and minerals mined or otherwise recovered in pursuance of an authority under this section that are not otherwise the property of the Commonwealth are, by force of this section, vested in the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* So  Senator Durack  's objections, expressed in 1 974, were really objections to the principal Act itself, the principal Act which the Government is now using as the linchpin for its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* At least that would give the Government some sort of powers in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which, apparently, the Government would not have over minerals generally throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* He seemed to be objecting in that instance to the fact that the regulations and the principal Act gave the Government powers over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which it did not have over minerals generally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That is ironic when one looks at clause 5 of the amending Bill now before the House which extends the definition of minerals covered by the amending legislation to 'minerals found in association with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* So this Liberal Party, which said three and a half years ago that it was a terrible thing for the Federal Government to attempt to proclaim rights over minerals other than <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is now introducing an amending Bill to do precisely that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That is the 1953 Act-  - and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as to its use in the production of atomic weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Act itself was coloured by views as to the great strategic importance of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Moreover, the Commonwealth Government has adequate powers in regard to the national interest as far as mining, including the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is concerned under its export control powers generally and under regulations that have been made under those powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Of course, the amendment to this Bill broadens even more widely the definition of a prescribed substance to include 'minerals found in association with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It ought to be very clear to any small '1' Liberal members of the Government that the use of that sort of legislation cannot be justified simply to provide a legal vehicle to carry the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I think the current score is that four or five States have formally protested to the Government, not about this measure but about the legislation associated with the Government's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining policy generally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It is well known that when the Labor Party was in government it set out as fast as it could to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with nothing like the safeguards that are proposed in this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* There are no plans whatsoever for the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, apart from the very small use to which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been put over the last 20 years in the production of isotopes for medical purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The environmentalists, who are sincere on this issue, will point out to  Senator Walsh  and to others that the use of coal can be more damaging to the environment than the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In addition, if we did not participate in the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we would have absolutely no control over its use throughout the world, no control over safeguards, weapons proliferation, and all those problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Whereas the Pancontinental mine, which is the richest known deposit of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world, would fit into an area less than one kilometre square, the area covered by this enormous projected mine in the Latrobe Valley is many hundreds of times larger than that.

* He said nothing during the whole of his speech to assure the people of Australia that there is an obligation on his Government to be able to present a clear cut case that the mining in and the proliferation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from this country have been cleared by our scientists so that not only this generation, including the people who will be engaged in the physical act of mining and transporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and eventually treating it, but also the generations to follow will have an assurance that their interests and rights are protected.

* The first Bill, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, flies in the face of recommendations from the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, but the Government has decided to use this as an instrument by which the Atomic Energy Commission can buy into the Ranger project and thus we can keep faith with the Memorandums of Understanding that were laid down by the Whitlam Government.

* I can see a lot of problems in this, and I think that the Government should pay attention to it in the future so that the process can be speeded up, so that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining can be started and, more importantly, so that the companies can have one person in the Government with whom they can deal when they have problems to get them tidied up.

* With all the legislation that we are bringing in to deal with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package, one would think that we were embarking on something that is completely new, something that is dangerous and something that the whole world should be wary of.

* The basic reason for that opposition to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is a commitment in the context of inadequate safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Secondly, we regard the Atomic Energy Act 1953 as being totally inappropriate to control commercial or civil <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The second report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry- the report of  Mr Justice  Fox which  Senator Collard  clearly has not read or has disposed of in his mind as being a totally irrelevant document- stated that the Atomic Energy Act 1953 should not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The first reason is that the Atomic Energy Act, which dates from 1953, contains specific provisions based on the defence power which will offer the Government a means of intimidating and suppressing public opposition to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Secondly, we believe that the Government is seeking, by means of this vehicle, to have comprehensive control of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining throughout the country and direct government involvement not only in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining but also in other forms of mineral development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Those are some quite substantial and simply stated objections that we have to the use of the Atomic Energy Act as the vehicle for proceeding with commercial <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That must be seen again in the context of the remarks made in the Fox report regarding the inappropriateness of the Atomic Energy Act for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining for peaceful purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That was the first extraordinary contradiction in which this Government got itself involved and it is not surprising that it is quite capable of doing the same thing in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That is a splendid purpose and if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is to take place nobody can properly object to that purpose. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The essential points which I have tried to make are simply these: The debate about the pros and cons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export will go on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* If we are to face up to that problem as a problem of a democratic pluralistic society and if we are to provide legislation which recognises the fact that we have the pretensions of belonging to a democratic pluralistic society- quite apart from  Senator Collard  's theories about the positive virtues of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and enrichment; the glorious nirvana which he painted for us- this Parliament has an obligation to ensure that the sorts of things which the Governor-General said are not merely empty rhetoric but that we in the Senate and in the other place believe in them.

* It seemed to me that so long as there was an opportunity for the expression of freedom of opinion about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia,  Senator Button  would have no objection to it other than that he would not have used the vehicle of the Atomic Energy Act for this purpose.

* On 31 October 1974, the Whitlam Labor Government tabled in the Parliament a statement announcing large scale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Northern Territory, commencing with the exploitation of the Ranger deposit, to be followed by the development of the Nabarlek and other deposits.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* As someone said in another place, it seems that the Opposition has developed a psychotic blockage about <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, so much so that it cannot see that the people of Australia want us to go ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, and that these Bills and the others which are in the package to come before the Senate later this evening are designed to do just that while protecting the people of Australia.

* But before doing so and bearing in mind that many of the issues in this debate have already been canvassed by speakers from both sides of the chamber, I want to refer briefly to the comment that was just made by  Senator Lewis  in which he said that the Labor Party appeared to have some psychotic blockage about the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry.

* Even the Premier of Queensland, who seems to get a lot of publicity in relation to many matters, who could not be described as an opponent of this Government, and who could not be described as an opponent of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, had to raise his objections with the Prime Minister.

* Much has been said during the debate so far, and it appears to me to be notable that speakers on the Government side have introduced matters of substance backed up, in my view, by a factual analysis of the important aspects of the implications of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an energy source to Australia and to a world facing a rapidly increasing demand for energy and a critical - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Another matter that was brought to my attention at Lucas Heights was the fact that coal mines, particularly underground mines, emit more radon- most mining in the world is underground- and, therefore, this subjects the miners to more radiation than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining.

* There does not seem to be the same urgency to make sure that those things are done before <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining commences as there is to bring in this repressive legislation which will prevent people giving this sort of information to other people once <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining has commenced.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* It seems to us that s. 4 1 is a special power which was enacted at a time when the need to secure Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for use by Great Britain and the United States of America in nuclear weapons was uppermost in the minds of those concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* This is in part because it is proposed that the Commission be actively engaged as entrepreneur, and in part because one of its ordinary roles is the promotion of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear development generally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The central difficulty for present purposes is that they belong to an organisation whose function is not simply one of research; it is also an active commercial and political force in the promotion of nuclear development and the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The whole rationale adds weight to the Labor Party's contention that we should open no more <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines and that the only proper way to safeguard the people of Australia from the difficulties, dangers and confusions that arise in this industry is to leave <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the ground. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is interesting to note that it was the Whitlam Government that made the decision to carry on with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in this country; it was the Whitlam Government that drew up the Ranger agreement and entered into partnership with the companies involved; and it was the Whitlam Government that set up the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in order to discover the best guidelines for the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* We do have a large proportion of what we might call 'cheap extractable <span class="highlight">uranium</span>', but a lot of other countries have <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for which the cost of extraction is a lot higher. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* As I explained here some time ago, we have approximately 25 per cent of the world's known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> if the price remains between $30 and $40 a lb. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The fact is that if we do not supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the world and keep the price down to a reasonable figure of $30 to $40 a lb-if the price goes up to $60 or $100 a lb, whatever it might be, because of a shortage of cheap extractable <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- all the nations are going to turn from the ordinary power plants as we know them today to the breeder reactors and will be using plutonium.

* What we have said- our policy remains this way- is that existing contracts should be honoured but that there should be no more mining until there is an assurance and scientific evidence to indicate that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste in particular could be safely stored and that there would be no proliferation of weapons or misuse of nuclear by-products.

* There are neither the facilities nor the requirements in those countries for the use of nuclear power, and if the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners are able to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it is very doubtful whether they will be worried anyway about the Third World.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* As to the background of these Bills, it is worth reminding the Senate that last year the people and the Parliament had before them the results of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry in two volumes, styled the First and Second Reports.

* Inevitably, although the debate on the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> had been extensive, the debate on these two Bills, although not strictly relevant was, on the part of the Opposition, one which went over again the whole question whether one should mine or mill <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or market it abroad. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* These Bills are important but to put it in perspective and because of the Opposition's approach to this matter, I should remind the Senate that the Ranger Environmental, or Fox Report said certain things regarding the mining, milling and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* The important contribution of the Ranger Inquiry also directed itself to whether or not Australia could influence the world if it decided not to mine, mill or market <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at all.

* What the Fox Commission directed its inquiry to was the fact that the world is energy hungry and is being forced to look in the short term at least towards <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as fossil fuels dry up. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* If by denial of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the world for use in slow water reactors we force nations through scarcity to turn <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to plutonium which can give indefinite sources of energy, we then by our action lead them, even incite them, into making fissile materials for nuclear weapons.

* If I can intrude one side comment, it is to say that it is strange tonight that those who in the days of the Whitlam Government sought to earn dollars for Australia by the mining and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in conjunction with a big company now see errors in our doing exactly the same thing.

* Those who follow the rules outlined by the Fox Committee in mining, milling and marketing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have the great responsibility and the enormous privilege to enter the world market and demand of the significant number of countries which will take our fuel that they observe our safeguards which are regarded as the most stringent safeguards in the world.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* First of all, I must point out that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia was first proposed when Labor was in power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* We pointed out that the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr E. G. Whitlam),  who was the then Prime Minister,  Dr Cairns,  who was the then Treasurer and  Mr Connor,  who was the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, made an agreement with Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd and other people for the development and the ultimate sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* I think it is a very odd situation, to say the least, that during a debate such as this honourable senators opposite come into the chamber crying poor when some years ago- as I said, when people knew less about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> than they do now- they were looking for the riches. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* Why is it- I exclude the honourable senator from the expression I am about to use- that the 'greenies' are concentrating on the Northern Territory- the area in which, naturally, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be mined- and ignoring the other parts of Australia where immense projects which are to take place will destroy the environment and may result in ill-effects for the communities near those projects.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* What really happened there was that there was a casual approach to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> itself did not cause damage to the country or pollute the streams. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* As I have said before, the complaint that I had in the last two weeks was about the fact that the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> outlined in the package that was presented some months ago to Australia and the world totally excluded participation by the people of the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* I will have more to say next week on the stage of self-government that we are now entering, but I would say now that, having brought Kakadu and the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry into being, we must ensure that whatever we do we encourage the people of the Territory to live and work together. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* By the insertion in the Bills of these numerous points the Government will ensure that the people of the Northern Territory will, to the degree promised in the course of various conferences, correspondence and so on, have some say in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* For example, Opposition senators have argued that it is wrong to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> because mining companies will get profits and make a dollar. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* Sadly there has run through this debate the polarisation of the argument that the protection of the people of Australia and of the world against radiation and genetic mutation and destruction is best achieved by not mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* I reminded the Senate yesterday, as I must do again today, that the Fox Committee report indicated that there were very large dangers to the safety, security and survival of the people of the world if Australia failed to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under proper safeguards and instead allowed the proliferation of plutonium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* The fact is that the Fox Committee said, and it is the authoritative body, that with proper safeguards the hazards of mining and milling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could be properly contained and were quite tolerable within the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* Honourable senators will know that some concern has been expressed about the role which the Northern Territory should play in the development of that plan for the Alligator Rivers Region as a consequence of the Commonwealth Government's decision to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* I conclude by once again thanking honourable senators for their contributions, by reminding them of the significance of these Bills as part of the total development, by reminding them of what the Fox Committee said in all these matters and by reminding them that we are moving into the general orchestration of the Fox Committee in the light of the statement by that Committee that if we had proper safeguards it would not be improper to proceed with the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* The consequences of that, as  Senator Walsh  pointed out, would be simply that, in dealing with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, to put it somewhat bluntly, the Government of Victoria could request that a code be proclaimed which would apply to that State.

* Any development of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines should be strictly regulated and controlled, for the purposes mentioned in Chapter 16. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* One does not need to go to Chapter 16 because that deals with the question of the hazards of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* Policy respecting Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports, for the time being at least, should be based on a full recognition of the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of nuclear energy and should therefore seek to limit or restrict expansion of that production. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* The consequence could be that, in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, potentially there could be a different standard in relation to safety codes in each State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* He said that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue was a matter of such concern that the States should cede their powers in that regard to the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* It is attempting to apply those principles in 1978, when we are dealing with the nuclear power industry and with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* That is a ridiculous situation, because whatever wisdom the Founding Fathers had, it was not of the kind which would have helped them understand the Fox report on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* In the face of widespread concern both in Australia and in the world, the Government has, on this fundamental issue of the importance of safety codes in the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, backed away- in the pursuit of some peculiar notion of its own, derived perhaps from Montesquieu and Adam Smith about the nature of the separation of powers and the desirability of having regard to the views of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* I refer to our recent correspondence on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation currently before the Parliament and to the meeting of 18 May 1978 between State and Commonwealth officials to discuss the State governments' concerns about the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* The officials indicated that the States saw these particular Bills as raising the possibility of Commonwealth intrusion into areas of State responsibilities in respect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and nuclear energy, that the Bills were seen as being of doubtful constitutional validity, that their passage raised the issue of constitutional impropriety with the Commonwealth resiling from its cooperative federalism policy, and that the Bills lacked specific arrangements for Commonwealth/State consultation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* This makes untrue the statement, set out in a large booklet, as to what the Government would do if the country gave it permission to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* This Bill is only one of the Bills needed to assure Australia that the safeguards that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  promised in return for the right to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be carried out. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* Despite the fact that a particular danger may exist because of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in one State, the Governor-General cannot take action unless he is requested to do so by a State Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* It should say that the Commonwealth cannot control <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining; perhaps it is better left to the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* There are some doubts about whether some of the States at some time or another will insist on the safety provisions required for mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* If radioactivity results from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it may have not only a local effect but also may extend beyond the border of the particular State in which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is taking place.

* Because it would have deleterious effects on parts of South Australia and not on the metropolitan area of Perth, it could well be that the Western Australian Government would be more satisfied with profits from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining than with the safety of South Australians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* Despite the fact that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at Roxby Downs in South Australia might be detrimental to the whole of South Australiait might be detrimental to the environment and to the health of the people- and the laws in South Australia do not provide the necessary protection, whether or not the laws of the Commonwealth provide the necessary protection, the Governor-General cannot do anything about it unless the State Government asks him to do something about it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* Whilst I admit that I am not a legal man, these provisions may be necessary in accordance with constitutional rights, but if they are necessary we have to admit that the Commonwealth Government cannot protect the environment from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining unless we first get a uniform code of agreement which all States will observe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* We know that the Premier of Queensland could not care less about the safety code so long as he can mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and get dollars for it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* What can we do in Western Australia where there is a person, Lang Hancock, who publicly states that there is no danger at all and we ought to be mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as fast as we can go and selling it as fast as possible? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* So where will safety come into it in those two States in which we know from past experience the two Premiers could not care less about any safeguards as long as they can dig the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground and sell it for money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* They could not give a hoot, nor could Lang Hancock who is on record time and time again as saying that he has come in close contact with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, he has flown over it and he has as good as eaten it and it has never affected him. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* He has even said- he repeated it here a few moments agothat the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> safeguards are split among a series of divisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* When I posed questions in my search for information during the examination of the estimates for the Department of Trade and Resources I found that there are seven divisional heads, two of whom are responsible for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* Is there anything in this legislation which will prevent the re-entry into Australia of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* There is no question that the Commonwealth will permit the return to Australia of any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> waste from overseas for burial or disposal in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* The existing code of practice in relation to radiation protection in the mining and milling of radioactive ores excludes or does not apply to the mining of ore that contains less than 0.02 per cent by weight of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and less than 0.05 per cent by weight of thorium, that has not within it at least a radon daughter concentration in excess of 0.33 wasting level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* Nor does it apply to a mill that produces concentrates that at no stage of milling contain more than 0.05 per cent by weight of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or thorium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* These arose from a common root, that we do not believe that there are adequate provisions either for specialist advisers on the conduct of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and milling, or for adequate public disclosure of the conditions which may be laid down and the practices which are being followed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* The purposes of the amendment were, firstly, to require that before the GovernorGeneral made any orders pertaining to the mining or milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> there would have to be a public inquiry and, secondly that the findings of that public inquiry would have to be reported to the Minister administering the Environment Protection Act of 1974 prior to any such order becoming operative. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* Essentially, this clause grants to any State the power to veto within that State codes of practice that the Commonwealth may lay down for the mining or milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* In effect, the Government is saying that there will be no codes relating to the mining or milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, no minimum standards of safety or environmental protection, unless the State governments impose them or unless the State governments agree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* I have pointed out to the Senate that all the States at this moment have to some greater or lesser degree a code of practice regarding the handling of fissionable material, the handling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and its products. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* Given that very recent precedent, one would not have to be unduly suspicious to fear that if the Queensland Government does something similar with respect to codes of practice for the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, this Government will likewise go to water. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* If we are to have a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, I think the Commonwealth has a direct and almost exclusive- if not exclusive, predominant- responsibility to ensure that there are proper codes of practice and proper laws. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* In the famous kit of documents on nuclear safeguards which the Government put out in its thousands- I referred to this last week and I shall have to refer to it again- it made great play of the sanctions which it could enact if a country which was buying <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia were to fail to comply with the safeguard obligations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* As I said last week, Lang Hancock has gone very close to saying that there is no danger at all in mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* From all the comments made by the people in the mining industryparticularly by the leading miner in Western Australia,  Mr Hancock,  who is most outspoken on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- one realises that they could not care less about safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* Some States will have virtually no immediate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> extraction; other States will have. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* It is wrong, at the time that we are passing a whole lot of Bills which relate to the commencement of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in this country, for the Opposition to hold up the legislation unless a uniform code is reached by all States on environmental protection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* -The purpose of the insertion of new Part IVa relates in a sense to a judicial and constitutional point which is simply this: Assuming the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 is passed and proclaimed, the Commonwealth Government will be given paramount rights over the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* A licensing provision in codes or regulations could not in itself authorise <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* Section 50 of the Act provides for wide powers of detention, search and arrest without warrant, which are extreme measures in relation to the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It shows that the oftenmade comment that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining will erode civil liberties, as has been made by many honourable senators, is quite accurate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Finally, these objections which I raise to sections of the Atomic Energy Act which will be used in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at Ranger clearly illustrate the contradictory stand on civil liberties by the Government and the use of extreme powers, which were employed in the Cold War period of the 1 940s, with respect to a commercial development in the late 1970's. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Can the Minister confirm a report in yesterday's  Age  to the effect that the Italian Government's energy conglomerate, Ento Nazionale Idrocarburi, wants Australia to help plug a multi-billion dollar gap in its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies?

* As we understand the position, Italy has secured most of its supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> up to about 1983, but thereafter it has a requirement for further supplies and it looks to Australia to satisfy some of those needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0)

* Consistent with Australian Government policy and subject to the completion of satisfactory safeguard arrangements, the Government looks forward to establishing a secure, stable and long-term relationship with Italy for supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to satisfy that country's energy requirements.

* In support of its aim for industrial development in South Australia, the South Australian Government in 1 975 set up a Committee on <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Enrichment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0)

* This Committee was charged with preparing a report on the general applicability and feasibility of establishing commercial plants for the manufacture of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride and for the enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on a South Australian site. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0)

* As this project would provide a tremendous stimulus to sadly flagging industrial development in South Australia, can the Minister say whether  Mr Dunstan  has abandoned the race for such a plant and is allowing the enterprising Court Government in Western Australia to beat him to the punch on the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment facility? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0)

* I am aware that in the report there is evidence of a study by the South Australian Government and I am aware that there was at that time and subsequently enormous interest in South Australia in the possible development of an enrichment plant to produce <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0)

* The development of those resources, whilst serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the environment, the welfare of the Aboriginal people and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Central to this aspect of our policy is the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority be established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* In his statement of 25 August 1977 the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  stated that the Government accepted the thrust of the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry and that we would establish a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority or similar marketing arrangements to achieve the objective of orderly development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* But he made clear that in the arrangements we made we would ensure that the Government had at all times proper knowledge, oversight and control over the arrangements under which Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is exported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* That control would always ensure that the Government would be in a position to move immediately to terminate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Against the above background the Government has considered carefully its attitude in regard to the machinery which should govern future exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and I shall now explain to the Senate the decisions we have taken at this stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is presently controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations of the Customs Act 1901. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> exports are prohibited unless a certificate in writing under the hand of the Minister for Trade and Resources, or an officer duly authorised by him, is produced to the Collector of Customs.

* In considering exports we will have regard to the principles I have already stated, some of which I now repeat briefly, namely: The orderly development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources; making supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> available to other countries for use in the generation of electricity and for other peaceful purposes; ensuring adherence to the policies of Australia in relation to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the application of safeguards against the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> other than for peaceful purposes.

* But it is also desirable that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers should be informed of the way in which that discretion will normally be exercised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Minister's approval for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from a particular project will be given only after full consideration by the Government following the completion of environmental procedures and compliance with the Government's foreign investment policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* I can say now, however, that Mary Kathleen <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Ltd and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission will be permitted to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the latter from the Ranger deposit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The mining and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from the Ranger deposit were the subject of arrangements which the Whitlam Government entered into with Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd. Our Government has previously stated on 25 August 1977, when approval for Ranger was announced, that the arrangements between the Whitlam Government and Peko-EZ would be honoured. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Having regard to the various considerations of national interest I have previously mentioned and the diversity of our deposits, it will be necessary for the Minister to exercise some control over the quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being exported at any one time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* It will also be necessary that the Minister determine in advance that the contracts which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers propose to enter into for the sale of their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to overseas buyers contain appropriate terms and conditions consistent with Australian Government nuclear safeguards policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Minister will also determine terms and conditions relating to the duration of the contract, the quantity of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be sold under the contract, the method of shipment of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the price payable for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the manner- including the currency- of payment, and the use to which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be put by the purchaser. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> producers will accordingly need to seek the approval of the Minister before making any firm offers or entering into any legal commitments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* When a contract has been entered into in accordance with the requirements that the Minister has notified beforehand, the producers will be required to lodge a copy of the contract with the Minister, whereupon it will be formally approved and form the basis for subsequent export approvals covering the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be exported in fulfilment of the contract. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Shipments of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will continue to be controlled, as is the case at present, on the basis of individual consignment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Minister will not issue a certificate under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations in respect of any consignment unless all aspects of Government policy are satisfied, including: That the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is being exported from a project which has the status of Government development approval; that the export is for the purpose of performing an approved contract; and that Australian safeguards policy is fully complied with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* I have referred to the Government's previously stated view that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority or similar arrangements should be established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* This body would be appropriately named the Australian <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Export Authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* I envisage that at the appropriate time in our progress with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export authority should be established to be charged with the duty of advising the Minister for Trade and Resources on the matters I have just outlined in relation to exports under new contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Such an authority would also carry out a number of important ancillary functions namely: To assemble and to correlate information relating to the known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and in other countries; to obtain and analyse information on the supply of and demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and other countries; to analyse trends in the international <span class="highlight">uranium</span> market; and to obtain information on the commercial arrangements for the upgrading and enrichment of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> within and outside Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The authority would also liaise with, and provide information to, the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* I might add that in view of the nature of the advice that the authority would need to provide, it would not be appropriate for its members to be chosen from the companies which were participating in the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The machinery and the procedures I have just outlined will ensure that the Government maintains strong regulation and control over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports in the national interest in a manner consistent with the Government's policy of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development announced on 25 August 1977 following receipt of the Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* It is a statement which claims once again that our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy is based on our obligations as a responsible member of the international community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* His  policy is to dig up <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as quickly as he can and sell it as quickly as he can. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* As usual the policy statement that we have just heard ignores these events and creates the impression that the Australian Government is desperately keen to press on with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at any cost. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* One of the most important recommendations of the Fox Report was that there be sequential development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Ignoring the recommendation on sequential development will have two effects: Firstly, there will be competition between the various producers to get their <span class="highlight">uranium</span> onto the market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* This will disrupt the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and is likely to result in Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> being sold at artificially low prices while producers struggle to get long term contracts overseas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Secondly, the rejection of that recommendation will result in substantial damage being done to the Northern Territory, and particularly the Aboriginal lands in the vicinity of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* It is well known that the various countries which are in the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have very different requirements and will be putting different pressures on the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* While on this issue, I should mention that it is becoming increasingly clear that  Mr Justice  Fox, Australia's Ambassador-at-Large, is becoming disenchanted with the prospects of obtaining adequate safeguards on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Japanese have just entered into a contract with Britain to reprocess American <span class="highlight">uranium</span> without obtaining the approval of the American Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* In these circumstances, it is unrealistic to believe that Australia can control reprocessing of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* All of these matters raise major objections to the line the Government takes on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Minister's statement proposes that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export authority should be established to advise the Minister on a range of matters dealing with export contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* It will assemble information dealing with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves, it will seek to analyse trends in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketparticularly future supply and demand- and it will be involved with commercial arrangements on a number of aspects dealing with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* However, such an authority was recommended by the Fox Report and, with a substance such as <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is no doubt very necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* In some ways it is a pity that this authority is not operating at present as it would be able to advise the Government that in view of the substantial downturn in the demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits should be on a quite different basis to that contemplated by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* An aspect of the Minister's statement which is more worrying is that part which deals with the control of the Minister over the terms and conditions to be included in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The statement points out that the Minister will determine the duration of the contract, the quantity to be sold, the method of shipment, the price payable and the use to which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be put. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* However, there is a real worry that if the Minister is determined to get as much <span class="highlight">uranium</span> onto the world market as possible, he will take a very lenient view about any of these matters and not exercise the control which is required. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* We heard the Leader of the Opposition this morning commenting on the paper produced by the Acting Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  entitled <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Export Policy', which is a ministerial statement of today's date.

* We spent three or four days in debate recently trying to extract from the Government what safeguards it intends for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1)

* He is about to sell all the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the open market, all of which will be used to make atomic bombs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1)

* I said in the debate on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills that this is all the Government is concerned about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1)

* The document from the Department of Trade and Resources proves that the Government attaches prime importance to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1)

* Will the Government investigate the truth of the assertion made by a  Mr Bruce  Chu, a vicepresident of the government-run Taiwan power company, that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> safeguards can be avoided because, to use his words, 'There will always be a free market in <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0)

* Indeed, one of the basic reasons that the Government has entered into the production, mining and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is that it gives the Government a voice in regard to safeguards which it would not otherwise have. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0)

* A spokesman for the Australian Conservation Foundation claims that because of a severe downturn in nuclear programs throughout the world and as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has moved from a sellers market to a buyers market, there was concern that the Australian Government would relax its stringent security and controls and, in an effort to boost sales, would offer sites within Australia for the dumping of nuclear waste. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0)

* The general evidence is that the market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fuel in the world will continue to grow, and grow significantly, and Australia will have a very important role in providing that fuel under the strictest safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0)

* In accordance with the recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, the Government has delayed issue of any formal authorities to mine until other recommendations concerning the grant of Aboriginal land and environmental protection mechanisms have been implemented. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0)

* The Government gives reasons to very few people, except the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners, why it introduces certain legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0)

* What steps has the Government taken, or will it take, to implement the recommendations contained in the First Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, that research and development programmes into (a) liquid fuels to replace petroleum, and (b) energy sources other than fossil and nuclear fusion are immediately and urgently required. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-16)

* That is why a few weeks ago we saw a mad rush to pass the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Accordingly, the Government has decided that forthwith: proposals for foreign investment in new projects will not require government approval under the foreign investment guidelines unless the project involves an investment of $5 million or more- this does not apply to investment in the financial sector and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; in the case of investments coming within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act, the Government will not normally seek to intervene if the assets of the company being taken over are less than $2m, unless there are special circumstances or the business is in the financial sector or some other area where special considerations apply; and individual real estate acquisitions of less than $250,000 will no longer require approval. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Honourable senators will remember the glossy white folder we received last year called 'Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy', or something like that, which was distributed to members of parliament, school children and Godknowswho else in Australia to explain to them that the Government was very concerned about the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to overseas countries and that it would insist on the highest possible standards.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45)

* It can be said that it is none of our business what they do in the Philippines but the point is that this Government again and again has said that we will sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> only if we are totally satisfied with the standards that will apply in the recipient countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45)

* If that is the answer, I would like to hear it said; otherwise it is ridiculous carrying on with debate on the so-called guidelines for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports which suggest that we are bestowing some form of beneficience upon the rest of the world by providing it not only with our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but also with our extremely high public standards as a bonus to the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* Only if the agreements have taken cognisance of those points can the much vaunted and lauded policy of the Government which we were given last year of ensuring that Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be sold only to countries where adequate and proper safeguards were provided, be put beyond the concern of members of this Parliament, and the policy upon which the Government has embarked in fact be seen to be living up to the rhetoric which accompanied its announcement last year.

* The reason I have risen to speak tonight is that there has been some sort of extreme speculation in the newspapers in relation to whether certain land tenure problems associated with Ranger would mean that the operations of one of the other two <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects would precede it.

* I repeat that what I am trying to get at is that, if there is an attempt to beat the gun to start the operations of one of the other proposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines, excluding Ranger, because of litigation flowing from the considerations of the Aboriginal land rights committee, decisions may be made which get away from the recommendations of the Fox report.

* It relates to the difficulties being experienced in the negotiations between Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd and the Northern Land Council which are causing further delays to Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines, Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Queensland Mines Ltd. As the delays will make it difficult for Australia to meet its existing contracts for the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to overseas countries, will the Minister consider giving early approval for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Yeelirrie and other Western Australian deposits?

* There are many reasons for this state of affairs and perhaps one is that the Labor Opposition at its 1 977 Perth Federal Conference decided upon a policy calling for a two-year moratorium on further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development- this, after having taken an enthusiastic development approach whilst in government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0)

* I ask also whether the delays in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory that have been caused by the indecision of the Northern Land Council will encourage further research into and development of fast breeder reactors throughout the world and encourage other countries to turn to other suppliers of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which in turn could mean, if the trend continued, that Aboriginals in the Northern Territory would miss out completely on royalties and monetary benefits from the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: In the light of the media report today that members of the NLC at Oenpelli have decided not to sign the Ranger agreement, not on the grounds as stated before of not wishing to disturb Aboriginal ground or of possible dangers in mining but that more money is demanded, will the Government take note of the petitions I have lodged this week in the Senate signed by over 5,000 people mainly from the Darwin area which call for the Government to take a realistic attitude to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the development of the North?

* The then Minister, in response to a request by  Mr J.

* Is the Minister aware that the South Australian Mines Department has estimated that the mineralisation of Roxby Downs in terms of copper is about five times the size of Mount Isa and that the ore body contains one lb of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide per tonne and gold of up to 15 pennyweights per tonne, which makes it a viable mining operation?

* On 25 August 1977 the Government announced its policy to develop the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the Ranger project area on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding of October 1975 which provided for mining to be undertaken under the Atomic Energy Act by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd as joint venturers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0)

* In this regard honourable senators will recall that in June this year the Atomic Energy Act was amended to authorise the participation of the Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0)

* One provision of the Memorandum requires that the initial authority for mining should be issued for 2 1 years, others provide that the Ranger project will be conducted as a commercial venture and continue in force during the economic life of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0)

* Essentially, the Bill deals with section 41 of the Atomic Energy Act, the section under which an authority to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is granted by the Minister for Trade and Resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* Quite bluntly, the Bill is an attempt to legislate against the possibility of a future Labor government revoking an authority to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* A decision to mine and sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should not be made unless the Commonwealth government ensures that the Commonwealth can at any time on the basis of considerations of the nature discussed in this report, immediately terminate those activities, permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period.

* On 25 August 1977 the Minister for Trade and Resources announced the Government's policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and in his statement on this very question stated: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* The Government will therefore always be in a position to move immediately to terminate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period as recommended by the Ranger inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* The second important consequence of this Bill is that new conditions and restrictions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, particularly those recommended in the Ranger report, could not be arbitrarily or unilaterally added to the authority to mine which is given by the Minister.

* We are dealing, in the case of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, with perhaps not a very dangerous process; but in dealing with the development of the nuclear industry generally we are dealing with a dangerous process which is a cause of concern to nations and communities throughout the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* Fourthly, the memorandum of understanding referred to an initial authority to be granted for a period of 2 1 years and added that the Ranger project was not to continue in force during the economic life of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore deposits in the project area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* Let me point to the main, basic objections of the Opposition: Firstly, there is the basic objection that the Labor Opposition has a different policy on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from that of the Government Of course, that is a legitimate objection of which account has to be taken in the normal process of political debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* The third main objection is that .governments should at all times have the authority to order the cessation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, based on considerations of nuclear proliferation, including the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty which we have signed and some of the countries to which we have arranged to sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> have signed but are clearly not abiding by. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* Governments should have the authority at all times to order the cessation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> rnining because of important issues such as waste disposal and environmental protection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* When one asks questions in this place about the steps which are being taken by miners in the Northern Territory in relation to that issue, one just does not get answers on important questions such as the pollution of the Alligator River, All these questions should be a fundamental principle that governments and this Parliament have the right to order the cessation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining because of some of those very important considerations which are involved in this issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* The whole case in favour of controlling <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploitation is that it needs and ought to be treated differently from other mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* If we look back to the headlines in newspapers prior to the 1977 election where people like  Mr Anthonythe  professional loud mouths of Australian politics- were promising that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining would produce 100,000 jobs, we recall that sort of stuff.

* One appreciates that, whilst  Senator Button  dealt in detail with some particular objections to the amendments, the overall policy of the Opposition at this stage is one of total opposition to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* The Government proposes to give security of tenure so that agreement will be reached between the Northern Land Council and the consortium with regard to the further mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> beyond 21 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* One appreciates, of course, that the Whitlam Labor Government was very keen to establish <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* When we consider the amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that will be mined- I refer to the Ranger project and to the Yeelirrie deposits in Western Australia, which the Western Australian Government is to get under way- and the need for safeguards we can understand the need for enrichment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to take place in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* The Dunstan Government- I give it full marks in this respect; I am not criticising it- has backed an expert <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment committee that has been working on research in this area for some six years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* However, we know that Western Australia, through its Premier,  Sir Charles  Court, is doing everything possible to get the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under way and would also like to see an enrichment plant established in that State.

* Another is also held by the Labor Party but at this stage it is not coming out in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, although it has done excellent work in regard to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment and I give it full marks for that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* With this vast amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, as well as that in the Northern Territory, there will be need for an enrichment plant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* If that happened, many members of the Australian Labor Party who sit on the other side of the chamber could at last stand up and speak openly, as they would like to do, in supporting the mining and development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, as they did when their party was in Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* I believe that the introduction of these amendments to the Atomic Energy Act amounts to an admission by the Government of how inappropriate this Act is as the legislative framework for the development and exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> within Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* It is true to say, and I think it needs to be freely admitted, that the Labor Government decided that this Act was suitable as an initial legislative base for the Ranger venture; but that same Government then set up the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and, I believe, undoubtedly would have acted on the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry to abandon this Act- a recommendation which was based on most cogent considerations which I will outline to the Senate shortly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* Of course, when one looks at the second reading speech of the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  in another place, it becomes quite obvious that for the Ranger project to be brought into a workable situation whereby <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be mined, it is most necessary for the proposed amendments to be passed.

* When one looks at the provisions of the old atomic energy legislation, which I think was introduced in 1945, relating to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it is obvious that that legislation is quite outmoded.

* I think many people have really forgotten that the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Northern Territory is not something new but really commenced many years ago, in the late 1940s or early 1950s, at Moline east of Katherine and at Batchelor, Rum Jungle, where the Australian Atomic Energy Commission developed <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* October 1975 saw the memorandum of understanding of the Labor Government brought into being and which, if I remember rightly, was signed by  Mr Whitlam, Mr Connor, Dr Cairns  and perhaps one other person on behalf of the Government and by the people of Peko-Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd to bring about the commencement of further <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)

* I believe that the people who have been against the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, particularly those people in the Northern Territory, who endeavoured during the negotiations with the Aboriginal people to prevent them from coming to an agreement, used every method under the sun to prevent the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mining Agreement from being made.

* It has been found that the existing provisions of the Atomic Energy Act which provide for an authority to mine under that Act, and which were drawn in completely different circumstances many years ago, are not appropriate to deal with authorities to be given for the commercial operation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining.

* In closing I mention this: I believe I heard in the media in the past few days that the unions have conducted an inquiry into the safeguards and the feasibility of workers mining in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* My recollection is that the person who has carried out that inquiry on behalf of the unions has said: 'Yes, there is every reason for workers to work in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* All that was asked was that certain safeguards be observed, which naturally they will, and that there will be consultation between the workers and the authorities who are working the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> mining means a lot to the Northern Territory; therefore, we should be somewhat hesitant about interrupting it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* I suppose that the records in the archives relate to a time before the value of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was known and before it started to be mined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* All that  Senator Kilgariff  could draw upon to justify his claim that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is not unhealthy was a report of  Mr Hunt,  who said that he had held a Federal inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* If an opinion poll were taken today or tomorrow I am quite convinced that the majority of people in this country would indicate that they want to see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> remain in the ground. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* Honourable senators opposite who are the greatest proponents of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> probably have amongst their portfolios large numbers of shares in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* I know that the excuse offered today is that a lot more is now known about the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and such devastation will not happen again. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* Australia certainly is rich in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fields and it ought to remain rich in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> fields by keeping the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under the ground until we know how to handle it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

* I simply ask: Where, when and how is the Australian taxpayer to receive a return on that $4,713,000 which is being expended in the current 12 months to carry out environmental studies to try to assess what damage may be done as a result of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-11)

* For example, it is said that at $30 per lb we have 23 per cent of the world's reserves, but that at $30 per lb our share drops to 8 per cent and at $100 per lb our share is almost negligible because <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be extracted from the sea for less. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-11)

* As the price of the fuel plays an important part in whether nations turn to the use of dangerous plutonium, will the Minister agree that this nation has a responsibility to supply the world with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a reasonable price to ensure that the use of breeder reactors is kept to a minimum?

* Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves (reasonably assured resources recoverable at a cost of up to $80 per kg U) represent a significant proportion of total Western world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves.

* For the information of honourable senators and in accordance with an undertaking given by the Minister for Trade and Resources in the House of Representatives on 2 1 August 1 979, 1 present a report by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies on the social impact of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on the Aborigines of the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-73)

* 
 -Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to move a motion in respect of the statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  on the social impact of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on the Northern Territory Aboriginals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* Northern Territory as it relates to mining generally, and mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in particular. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* I say this without setting aside the moral aspect of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* -by leave- I wish to make a brief statement on this report about the social impact of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* I have not been able to study the report for reasons that  Senator Gietzelt  mentioned, but I note that in the statement tabled by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  he does not mention the potential effect on the diet of the people of the East Alligator Rivers region of unfettered <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* Senate, because it is the area which, for very good geographical reasons, must be used for discharge, drainage or seepage from the tailings dams of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> operations of both Ranger and of Pancontinental Mining Ltd at Jabiluka. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* The geological accident that nature has provided there in association with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits, I suggest, creates a problem of major proportions to which we must address ourselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* I believe  Senator Missen  was the only member of this Parliament to raise the possibility that some sections of that Act as used to regulate the exploitation of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit were in contradiction to the sons of principles which should govern the peaceful exploitation of those resources for the development of energy concerns rather than, as at the time when the legislation was originally framed, for the provision of nuclear weapons materials for our allies, such as when Rum Jungle was the deposit being exploited. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94)

* That is the sort of instance where legislation comes into a chamber and the focus is on an element of that legislation- in that case the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits- and clauses to do with human rights and their infringement get lost perhaps in general argument on matters of more public concern.

* The effect of these policies is to encourage capital-intensive extractive industries such as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and coal, under conditions which we believe are detrimental to the country as a whole.

* On 10 June 1979 I announced that the Government had reviewed the foreign investment policy guidelines for new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> projects and had made certain modifications to them.

* Previously, the guidelines had required that a proposed new project for the rnining and production of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should ha ve a minimum of 75 per cent Australian equity and should be Australian controlled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69)

* The proposal by Western Mining Corporation to develop the Olympic Dam copper-gold-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> prospect at Roxby Downs in conjunction with the BP Group, with interests of 51 per cent and 49 per cent respectively, indicated the efforts it had made to find an Australian partner.
