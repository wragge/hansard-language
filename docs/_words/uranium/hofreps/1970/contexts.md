* The discovery of the giant <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit at Nabarlek, with its concentration of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide as high as 540 lb per ton, opens up a number of questions in relation to reactor type selection and fuel policy.

* In view of our earlier fiascos this matter needs a lot of careful examination and, as the member for the electorate in which the Lucas Heights atomic research establishment is located, I want the Committee to know that people in very high, eminent and responsible positions at the reactor are saying precisely what I have already said, and they are very anxious to ensure that the proposed <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment project is not undertaken without proper consideration, because enormous public expenditure is involved.

* If one talks in terms of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> of which we have about 200,000 short tons, it has been estimated that the United States will not be in a position to export enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> after 1980.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0)

* I conclude on this point: When the people of Australia realise just how important it is for a nation to control its resources, whether they be oil, gas, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or fossil fuel, in the national interest and in terms of the world energy crisis, the Government must be in the position to act in the national interest and, more importantly, in the international interest.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0)

* But as I said, the Opposition is under the pressure of big business and the mining companies who want to reef <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground and get an exorbitant profit irrespective of what is done with it or what it could be worth after 1980. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0)

* I believe that it is the proper attitude of the Minister for Minerals and Energy to intend to recommend to Cabinet that we set up a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0)

* The Minister pointed out that in their search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> the mining companies spent a mere $12m and that the success of their search undoubtedly would have depended on the preliminary research done by the Bureau of Mineral Resources of Australia which is controlled by this Parliament and paid for by the Australian taxpayer.But on the other hand the estimated value of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on present world prices is $7,000m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0)

* We know that the mining companies use this argument in the ears of those who are not knowledgeable in politics and they get a very patient hearing when they say that they had spent $12m searching for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that the Government will not let them develop it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0)

* That sounds very good but when it is pointed out to them, as some of us do point out when we go to other parts of Australia, it is a mere bagatelle when the value of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is$7,000m.

* I do not intend to debate the details of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy in this adjournment debate because it is not the occasion to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* I do not claim to have spoken to the same people in high places as the Prime Minister, but I spoke to a good cross-section of officers of the United States and Canadian Governments and to leading men in the nuclear and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in the United States in particular. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* The clear, unmistakable message which I received from within both government and industry was, firstly, that Australia was missing the boat in the world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> trade and, secondly, that the economic nationalism of the Minister for Minerals and Energy was against the foreign policy interests of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* What was being advised to  Mr Whitlam  was, firstly, that world market trends made it imperative that if Australia was to take advantage of a unique sellers' market developing in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it should act immediately to enter that market and should not delay the entry and, secondly, that if Australian foreign policy was to fit into the desired foreign policy of the Western world for a sharing of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resource Australia had to play its part as a supplier of that resource to the developed countries of the Western world, more particularly when Australia had, by any standards, at least 25 per cent of the known world reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* In order to establish that the Prime Minister's advice, which he received in both the United States of America and Canada, was accurate one has only to have recourse to any reputable assessment of the supply and demand pattern in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> use in the decade of the 1980s and beyond. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* Every reputable assessment of that pattern shows that the combination of the nuclear reactors to be commenced in the decade of the 1980s and in particular the number of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plants required in the Western world to satisfy enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> demand has compelled the international <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry to reassess that demand in the 1980s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* Therefore, once the projected demand for enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is appreciated, looking at it from a conservative view and looking at the more accelerated nuclear growth patterns for that decade, it is quite clear that by 1990 the Western world will require between six and nine new enrichment plants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* An immense amount of money is required; an immense amount of investment will need to be marshalled in order to supply the free world with its enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* That means that now is the time for Australia to make its firm policy decision on how it is to enter the international market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> either in yellowcake form or enriched form. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* However it is not about any one of those particular headings that I want to talk, it is about 3 items that come under the heading 'Adminstrative', namely, the Redcliffs petto-chemical industry, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry and solar energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* But what we are complaining about is, firstly, that the present climate is such that exploration in the mining and petroleum industries has been discouraged to such an extent that it is dropping alarmingly; and, secondly, that the Government has prevented Australian firms from writing contracts for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> overseas despite the fact that we have some hundreds of thousands of tons more than we can possibly use ourselves this century. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* Not one pound of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been sold overseas by a contract approved by the present Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* So these sales are going to our overseas competitors while our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lies in the ground. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* He said his policy is to allow the export of enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> only because this will be worth 5 times as much as natural <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* Even here he is in error as usual, as industry sources claim that the figure is only two and a half times greater for enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> But an enrichment plant, as we know, would cost $2,000m to $3,000m and could' not possibly operate before the mid 1980s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* In the meantime, we are losing sales to Japan, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi in Italy, Centrales Nucleares S.A. in Spain, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Finland and Belgium, all of whom want to get our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* Yet the same Country Party members now call for the Government to screw Prime Minister Tanaka's arm by threatening to withhold <span class="highlight">uranium</span> unless beef contracts are granted to us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* That is, he is trying to say that this is the Government's total attitude to minerals because we are not breaking our necks to give away <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, which is our most valuable strategic resourse to any bidder. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* It is true that we have had problems with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but a policy has been formulated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* As secretary of the Government Members Resources Committee, I have been heavily lobbied over the last few weeks by members of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* Yet the Government just blunders along without any sound policies on oil exploration, oil and gas development, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or coal liquefaction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* As the honourable member for Farrer  (Mr Fairbairn)  has already pointed out, the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry has been halted for the last 2 years and no new contracts have been permitted by the Government, despite the fact that between 1975 and 1990 Japan is expected to require 170,000 short tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* Most recent of all we have had the halfbaked proposition to establish a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* On that occasion, the Government offered the Japanese joint participation in a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment plant using their technology and finance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* 1 turn now to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and, here again, we were faced with some last minute what one might call death bed repentance contracts- contracts rushed into at miserable prices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* We have in reserve 2,250 tons of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide, which is more than sufficient to meet the delivery dates under those contracts up to the year 1 980. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30)

* We have only to consider the suggestion of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as an energy source to realise that we are beset with enormous problems associated with nuclear reactors, problems of leakage and the transport of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and associated material.

* The House is of the opinion that the Minister for Minerals and Energy should make a statement orally so that the House, instead of merely having presented to it a paper on the matter of Northern Territory <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, should be able to debate it.

* I would have thought that if there had been preliminary discussions at an official level on this whole mutual trade arrangement between Japan and Australia, with special reference to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and beef, which were the 2 big questions when the Japanese Prime Minister came here- apart from the motor car industry, and even the problems there are small compared with those of the beef industry of Australia- that a satisfactory solution should have been found.

* I told the people in the 1972 election campaign and in the 1974 election campaign that the Australian Government, which has of course complete power within the Northern Territory in such matters- largely, I am happy to acknowledge, due to the legislation introduced by the Menzies Government over 20 years ago- will not allow mining, including mining for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, to take place on lands to which the Aboriginal people of Australia have a legitimate claim.

* In addition to that, it was clearly understood that the Government, because of the nature of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- after all, it is a weapons source as much as being a source of energy- wanted to have some say in the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0)

* So when we look at the actions of this Minister in relation to the pricing of iron ore exports, of coal exports, in the denial of vital energy sources such as natural gas and in inhibiting the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to Japan, we wonder whether in the pursuit of the attitude expressed by him in 1 970 he is seeking to inhibit seriously Japan's ability to trade with the world.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-11-0)

* In view of the fact that the Government is not entering into any equity arrangement with the Ranger consortium but wants to confiscate 50 per cent of the production from the mines on the ground that the Australian Government owns the mining resources of the Northern Territory, I ask: Is it now the policy of the Government to acquire 50 per cent of the production of any new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project in the Northern Territory?

* The double dealings and shifty talk of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  about the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> leases in the area close to Arnhem Land have disadvantaged tremendously not only the companies involved there but also the Northern Territory as <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports would be a great source of income to the Northern Territory and of great assistance to the rehabilitation of Darwin.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In fact the debate should only be upon the first report of the Ranger Inquiry but in its indecent haste the Government, within days of the presentation of this report, made a statement of policy indicating its intention to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under the existing contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* For instance, why could there not have been firm recommendations on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supply in relation to existing contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The Government, I believe, made a decision a long time ago to mine and export Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on a large scale basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* This is what the debate is all about- whether Australia moves into wholesale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports or not. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In making his statement on existing contracts, the Minister failed to mention that the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> currently available in Australia from mining and stockpiles fails to meet the totality of the existing contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* While the Prime Minister at question time today said that he will wait upon the presentation of the second report and preaches a wait and see policy, in fact, unless I am badly mistaken, he and his Government are determined to press ahead with large scale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The Prime Minister's crude attempt to jam the Opposition into a premature debate on the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue last Tuesday week by his announcement the previous Thursday of the Government's decision on the existing contracts failed when the Opposition took the challenge and determined an attitude to that particular question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Honourable members will be aware now that the Opposition has determined that in government it would prohibit the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines for an indefinite period and indicated that it will not honour any new contracts that were signed by the Fraser Government or any other future conservative government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* If I am correct and the Government presses ahead with new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia, it will do so in disregard of the notice of caution articulated in the Fox report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Policy respecting Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports, for the time being at least, should be based on a full recognition of the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of nuclear energy, and should therefore seek to limit or restrict expansion of that production. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* His  original statement and his subsequent statement have been interpreted by the mining industry and by the investing public as a clear endorsement by the Government of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The Australian stock exchange responded to the Government's statement and the media broadly interpreted the Commission's report and the subsequent ministerial statement as a green light for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The Government has engaged and is engaging in a massive deception, and the Fraser Island decision in respect of the dishonouring of contracts following the environmental report is but a throw-away to the environmentalists in Australia to gain some ground for the Government to move rapidly into the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Let it be made perfectly clear that the Opposition does not support the establishment of new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining capacity in Australia until the nuclear industry has put its house in order. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* A future Labor government will not be bound by decisions taken by the Fraser Government or any other conservative government, in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Whether Australia supplies <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to the world or not it should not abrogate its responsibilities in developing new energy technology. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In conclusion, I urge the Government to take heed of the Fox Commission's call for a full public debate before a decision is taken in respect of the establishment of new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines and not to commit Australia to a role in the expansion of nuclear power which its citizens and their children may regret. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* I state that we should mine and sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* We have heard a lot about the dangers of mining and processing <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* We have been inundated with alarmist calls about the dangers of using <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the generation of power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The truth is that the mining of the relatively low grade deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, principally by open pit mining methods, by safety conscious people is no more dangerous than any other mining operation and is far less injurious to health than the underground mining of many other minerals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* This has nothing to do with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Because of the specific care which will be exercised in mining <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and because it appears that the known deposits will be mined by open pit mining methods, the incidence of mining illness will be considerably less than in the mining of other materials. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* A study paper prepared by the brilliant  Mr William  Wright and  Mr John  Silver of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has stated that the immediate setting up of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, with the aid of scientists, could result in earnings of $3,000m a year by 1985. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In the report the director of the unit claims that by the mid or late 1 980s <span class="highlight">uranium</span> could be one of Australia's most important mineral exports in terms of overseas earnings and could be earning considerably more than the wheat or wool industries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Australia has about 19 per cent of the West's reasonably assured lowgrade low-cost resources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Although it makes little difference to the rest of the world if Australia exports its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it could deny Australia real benefits in foreign currency earnings, employment and national development if we do not do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The alternative policy of development of resources would make it financially beneficial to install plants immediately for the conversion of yellowcake into enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in nuclear reactors is the safest method of generating power at a reasonable cost. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The dangers from <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-fuelled reactors is minimal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The information which I have goes on to illustrate the safety aspects of using <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* It is significant that the main opponents of the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and its export are being mobilised and financed by sources and people who are communist-inspired and some of those sit opposite in this House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* If we do not mine and sell our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> do honourable members think that this decision will have any effect on the world 's generation of nuclear power? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* If <span class="highlight">uranium</span> cannot be gained from this source it can always be obtained from sea water. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* It we do not mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the world market subject to the most stringent conditions possible the users will get their supplies elsewhere. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* We are not the only country in the world that has <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* We do not have the only <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits that can be mined viably. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* We will only penalise the Australian people and Australia as a country if we do not utilise this immense wealth and our immense resources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* I would like to quote one part of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry Report which the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  was not game to quote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* It was not contended that, if properly regulated and controlled, hazards associated only with the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were of such a magnitude that those operations should not be allowed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Therefore a lot of nonsense is being spoken about <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at the present time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* We mentioned earlier an argument that Australia should permanently refuse to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, or should at least postpone supply, with a view to persuading other countries, by our example, from entering upon or further developing nuclear power production. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* These matters might not have been of any concern at all had we not advanced our preparations for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to the stage they have now reached, so that our readiness and ability to supply within a few years are now obvious. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* On the evidence available to us no country with an expressed intention to buy Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will in the meantime be dependent on Australia, in the sense that supplies at reasonable cost could not be obtained elsewhere. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* It is nonsense to think that any action which we in Australia might take in the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will have any significant effect on the world's nuclear power generating stations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Let us be clear about the choices open to us in this debate on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* It is not a question of whether to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The changeover to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> power will make it possible to extend the lifetime of fossil fuels and reserve these for uses for which they are unique. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Chapter 9 investigates the benefits and costs of exporting and not exporting Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Australians need to consider the ramifications of a policy of steaming coal exports replacing <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Whereas by 1985 Australia will easily be able to export 15 000 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide a year, the equivalent in black steaming coal amounts to approximately 200 million tonnes a year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* One thing that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can give us is a source of income so that we can put money into those areas if we want to replace fission power by the end of this century. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* He is adopting the same attitude in the alleged dispute about whether we should export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Morality is supposed to be the business of the churches; but not the morality of whether we should export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. Let the churches take a close look at the State of South Australia to see some of the licence abroad there. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Let us look at the huge wealth of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore that exists in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Australia has precisely 30 per cent of the known deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore in the world today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* We find that South Australia, which has some <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore apart from its activated philosophies, has 15 875 tonnes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* All these represent about 30 per cent of the known <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits in the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The fact is that 70 per cent of the world's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore is being worked and is providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of nonAustralians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* With all due respect to  Mr Justice  Fox, we never required that inquiry to be aware of the safeguards that must be applied in the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Ask any common worker, any unionist, any executive in the mining companies, anyone in the community involved, even the smallest child, and he can tell you that the safeguards required for the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are well known and that we did not require a costly report to bring them to our notice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* So I hope, and there is not much argument in the House, that we will support the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ore with the safeguards- I will not say 'as suggested by the Fox report' although they were suggested by itwhich are so obvious to everyone associated with the industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* I ought to point out first of all that in common with many people in the community I once felt and expressed the view that we should mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* If nuclear weapons were not associated inextricably with the production of nuclear power I would have no worry, but nuclear weapons are inextricably associated with the production of nuclear power and I find myself quite uneasy about proposals to mine and export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and about the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> energy in the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* I also believe that if in government the Labor Party is satisfied that the hazards associated with nuclear power can be eliminated and satisfactory methods of waste disposal developed the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining could be reconsidered in the context of full public debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* The last factor is important only in the context that it rebuts many of the rather exaggerated assertions about the Eldorado that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is supposed to represent for Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* It might be argued that in Australia's case we will mine and mill for export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but will do not much more than that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* So a real problem is potentially involved in our association with commercial sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In those circumstances I think any reasonable person is justified in expressing caution about our commitment to anything that smacks of wholesale mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* I think that honourable members could well meditate on this before rushing off and suggesting, as did the honourable member for Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  that people are disloyal or wanting in patriotism for feeling uneasy about proposals for the wholesale extraction and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In relation to the so-called social and economic benefits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining the report makes it clear that no more than 250 people would be employed at any time in a mining project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* It goes on to point out that in the case of the Ranger project over the period 1976-77 to 1989-90 the return in real current terms will be no more than $197m and that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports will add no more than 4 per cent to the national income. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* My visit to Britain also allowed me to inform myself of the latest developments in the fields of offshore gas production and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> enrichment and nuclear fuel processing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-4)

* Since those recommendations and the second findings or recommendations appear to be the main basis upon which the Government has decided to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports and subsequent <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, does he still consider the first recommendations in the Fox report to be the major recommendations? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-6-0)

* -The Government's position on the  mining  and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is perfectly clear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-6-0)

* He was referring to the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and said that the trade union movement must stop the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0)

* The more people study the Green report and this Bill, the more obvious it is that the Government is misrepresenting and undercutting the Green inquiry, just as it is misrepresenting and evading the Fox report on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0)

* So we shall rely increasingly on mining and in the years ahead we shall rely to a very significant extent on <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, if those standards of living are to be maintained and if imports are to be paid for. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0)

* I did not rise tonight to talk about that matter, but I think what he has said brings to the attention of the House the very sane policy of the Government, of which I am a member, of ensuring that the whole matter of nuclear power and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is looked at very carefully and also in ensuring that the problem of the disposal of waste is carefully considered before the Government makes its final decision.

* We are talking about something which I believe and which  Mr Justice  Fox and his Commission think is the most important issue ever faced in this country, because it is not only a question of what the high level or low level wastes might do to Australians in the mining, milling and enriching of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but also a question that can affect the whole of the human race and life on this planet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6)

* Why does it not spend as much money on such a booklet and disseminating it to the people- such a booklet would carry the 'yes' case and the 'no' case- as we spend on issues which are of far less importance than that of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>?

* As a lawyer one might have hoped to amend this piece of legislation to ensure that the Australian people could express an opinion on any number of matters that the Government may from time to time decide; for example, the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and matters of that nature could well have been encompassed in what might be called a general purpose provision.

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister's statements when he addressed the National Press Club and when he launched the book  <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> on Trial  gave the clearest indication of the staggering extent to which he fails to understand the significance of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> question and has sought to subvert the findings of the Fox Commission.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* The meaning of that decision and my statement on 29 March, and of this present statement, is to urge the Fraser Government and the people of Australia to recognise the great responsibility that our control over 20 per cent of the world's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> imposes upon us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* Normally in the case of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> this question arises because of the dangers of radiation when <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is used, the dangers of nuclear explosions and breakdowns caused deliberately or by accident when nuclear power is being produced, the dangers of radiation from nuclear waste, especially plutonium, which so far as present knowledge goes cannot ever be eliminated, and the fact that peaceful uses of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> cannot be separated from the production of nuclear bombs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* The mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia will inevitably increase the number of nuclear bombs produced and the number of countries which will produce those bombs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* In the case of radiation from the normal processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, it is assumed that in setting radiation protection standards any exposure to radiation involves some risk of injury. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* Processing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the foreseeable future, no matter what the standard of protection, will involve some addition to background radiation and, if there is no threshold, it will involve people in radiation sickness in some significant numbers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* In the case of Australia, it is easy for those who believe that as owners of industries, or as workers, they will benefit in money from the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to say, in effect: 'It won't be processed here; there's no immediate risk for us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* There is nothing Australia can do to reduce the risk of explosion or pollution in other countries, in a nuclear plant, or in transport of radioactive materials by accident or design, but there is something Australia can do to share the costs of radioactive contamination from plutonium wastes- that is to take back the radioactive wastes of the processing of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and try to store them away safely for the next 25 000 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* Such a proposal may yet be put to Australia and it would at least test the integrity of those who are anxious to export both <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the risks of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and bring the issues home to the public much more vividly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* At any rate, to believe that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be mined, exported and processed because it will give a higher level of happiness from a high level of consumption of material goods is a delusion, and it is a delusion which sooner or later will have terrible consequences. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* Clearly, the development of nuclear power in the rest of the world can continue whether or not Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is made available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* The evidence indicates that, if nuclear power programs proceed at the rate projected in 1976, additional <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production capacity will have to be established in other countries to meet projected demands in the 1980s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* Consequently, the unavailability of Australian supplies in this period would not make an appreciable difference to the average price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* It would seem that the availability of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will have little or no effect on the ultimate development of power generation by nuclear means. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* These matters might not have been of any concern at all had we not advanced our preparations for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to the stage they have now reached, so that our readiness and ability to supply within a few years are now obvious.

* On the evidence available to us no country with an expressed intention to buy Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will in the meantime be dependent on Australia, in the sense that supplies at reasonable cost could not be obtained elsewhere. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* But I am so far only talking about the possible mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> subject to acceptable safeguards and only after the Government has reached a decision following the receipt of the second Fox report But even from mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> the benefits to Australia are immense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* The safeguards policy which we will follow is, in our view, appropriate for any country to follow whether it be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplier or consumer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The Government fully accepts that, if it were in future to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export from Australia, this would carry with it added responsibilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Against the background of these international responsibilities the Government accepts that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a special commodity, the export of which would involve important considerations of a kind not involved in the export of other commodities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* It will be recalled that, following the release of the First Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, the Government announced in the House on 1 1 November 1976 that it supported the Inquiry's view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The announcement of a policy at this stage, of course, in no way preempts a decision on the question whether any such new contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be permitted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* That the Government has taken certain decisions on safeguards policy at this stage reflects its determination to make sure that an established framework of policy exists so that any new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports take place under the most carefully considered and responsible conditions possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The Government wishes to avoid a situation in which decisions may be required on new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing at some point in the future without the benefit of a clear policy on the ground rules to apply so far as safeguards are concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Australia is a potentially significant supplier of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but if we are to play the part which this potential gives us the opportunity to play of contributing effectively to international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, it is desirable that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries and other nuclear supplier countries alike know where Australia stands on the matter of safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In a broader sense, safeguards for future Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports would comprise, as well as the application of international safeguards in this strict sense, the securing from importing countries of adequate assurances regarding the use and control of supplied nuclear material and the conclusion of binding arrangements to give effect to such assurances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; the application of effective International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to re-export, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Second, should the Government approve further development of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry it will retain the right to be selective in the countries to whom <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export will be permitted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The following minimum criteria for eligibility to receive Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will apply. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* We will therefore export only to nuclear weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In this respect the Government's policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry in its first report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Third, the Government wishes to ensure that if a decision is taken to permit new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards from the time it leaves Australian ownership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Accordingly, it will be the Government's policy that any future sales arrangements for exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should be such that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be in a form which attracts full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Fourth, Australia will require the prior conclusion of bilateral agreements between the Australian Government and countries wishing to import Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> under any future contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* These bilateral agreements will provide a framework for direct and binding assurances by importing countries to the Australian Government in relation to the use and control of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Australia or nuclear material derived from its use. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Australia would seek to arrange with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries regular expertlevel consultations to satisfy ourselves of the implementation of the provisions of bilateral agreements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In line with the positions taken by the United States and Canada Australia would retain the right to cease supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to any country which breached safeguards undertakings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* I have already made clear that Australia would not be prepared to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to such countries in the absence of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards applied under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Sixth, the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied by Australia to one country, or nuclear material derived from its use, to be able to be reexported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* For this reason the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries should make any transfer of supplied material to a third party contingent on a prior consent of the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* This provision will give Australia the means of making sure that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we supply or nuclear material derived from it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Seventh, we would require that Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplied to other countries for peaceful uses not be enriched beyond 20 per cent <span class="highlight">uranium</span>-235 without prior Australian consent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In respect of this requirement also, the Government's policy extends beyond the recommendations made by the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry in its first report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In order to reserve effectively Australia's position on this matter for the time being we would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that any reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* This requirement is additional to those recommended by the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry in its first report and reflects similar concerns to those expressed by the inquiry in relation to reprocessing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Ninth, the Government would require in future bilateral agreements the assurance from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importing countries that adequate physical security will be maintained on their nuclear industries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* These requirements also translate into concrete policy measures concerns expressed by the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* For this reason, although the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> environmental inquiry in its first report did not make a recommendation on this matter, the Government has decided that it is desirable that, as a standard practice, a clause should be included in any future contracts for the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia noting that the transaction is subject to safeguards as agreed between the importing country and the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* It builds on the preliminary thinking of the Government described in testimony to the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry last year, as well as the recommendations of" the First Report of the Inquiry itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries- both <span class="highlight">uranium</span> importers and major nuclear exporters- and relevant international organisations including the International Atomic Energy Agency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* As a result the Government is satisfied that the policy it has decided upon represents a practical, reasonable and effective package of safeguards measures to seek from countries wishing to import <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia under any future contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The point is that the Government now regards this statement as a complete policy on safeguards to usher in a policy of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The basic implication behind the statement is that Australia will export its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, and pretty soon. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* At that time the  Deputy  Prime Minister softened up the Carter Administration and made it perfectly clear that Australia would do all that it could to export its <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* This is not a capricious policy; it is a responsible attitude that makes it clear to the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry that any initiatives that the Fraser Government may take on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development do not necessarily lock a future Labor Government into such arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* I have stressed these provisions to international finance groups and to the mining industry and, I hope, to the Carter Administration so that they understand that the Government cannot lock a future Labor Government into a premature <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development policy.

* Perhaps the Government's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy will join the long list of the Prime Minister's recent failures- the wage-price freeze blowout, the airline strike provocation, the Industrial Relations Bureau backtrack, the first referendum failure and now a broken down <span class="highlight">uranium</span> policy to follow.

* From this, in my view it depends on one's interpretation of 'hazard' as to whether one takes the simplistic view that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is safe or whether the anxieties surrounding all that flows from such mining, and in essence discussed in the bulk of the report and the subject of the remaining 13 recommendations, mean that the total hazards preclude mining.

* In no way can recommendation 3 or any of the following recommendations be seen as either unrelated to the first 2 recommendations, or supporting the contention that the first 2 recommendations mean mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> by Australia should proceed without a full community debate on all the implications of nuclear power.

* If we fulfil safeguards and do not export to countries which have dealt with non-signatories to the non-proliferation Treaty and which are developing plutonium economies, we must bypass the United States of America which has sold enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to India, and also Japan which, through its Australian Ambassador this week called on Australia to ignore the policy of the Carter Administration against fast breeder reactors which Japan is rapidly developing.

* -The release of the Government's safeguards policy and the second Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> inquiry report have enabled the Parliament to discuss in depth the conditions under which Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be mined and whether it is to be exported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* In my view the issues have been largely oversimplified and polarised by the minority groups which are emotionally or financially involved so that the Australian public, in effect, has been asked to choose between 2 extremes- unlimited nuclear power for the world or bans on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* This means to other countries an increased input of about 45 per cent; thirdly, if recycling of plutonium and <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is reduced, ample enrichment facilities will be needed; and fourthly, a system of international waste disposal centres probably will be required.

* For example, the message should be made even clearer to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> buyers that any nuclear explosion set off by countries other than the recognised nuclear powers- that is, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, China and France- will result in immediate and permanent cessation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies from Canada, Australia and the United States.

* The 2 Fox reports have emphasised the complexity of the issues confronting Australia over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Australia has extensive deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at a time when the world faces the need to make fundamental changes in its supply and use of energy resources, when there is growing concern for the environment in which we live, and when there is anxiety over the proliferation of nuclear weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The very mention of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> propels us into an international arena and confronts us with a wide range of issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* I must say that speakers in this debate from both sides of the House have comprehended many of these issues, drawing them together in a consideration of nuclear safeguard policies, the potentiality of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry itself and the reports of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* While I am on the subject of the inquiry I think I have to say that the Parliament is indeed fortunate to have available to it the 2 reports on the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> problem. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The 2 reports taken together represent a major contribution not only to Australia but also to international understanding of the environmental consequences of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in the broadest terms as it affects mankind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* In particular, we strongly supported the inquiry's view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Prime Minister's statement on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports last week was the culmination of a long study by the Government of this significant aspect of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* For its part, the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry helped crystallise many of the issues and enabled the Government to take that issue further. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The announcement of that policy in no way pre-empted the decisions which the Government must take on whether to mine or export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Since the first report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry the Government, in formulating a policy in this matter, has taken into account the report of the Australian Safeguards Mission which was made late last year, the Prime Minister's correspondence with  President  Carter and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada and the recent visit to North America by the Acting Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and several other Australian Government officials. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* As set out in the Government's statement of 1 1 November following the First Report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, the Government is satisfied that appropriate controls would apply to the shipments under these contracts which will be used for electric power generation in Japan, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, all of which are parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The material will be processed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States which are parties to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and which require stringent safeguards on the material processed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Furthermore, in this regard as Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be finally processed into enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the United States, it will attract the full force of the safeguards policy recently announced by  President  Carter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* If Australia proceeds with further development of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources, and safeguards agreements of the kind outlined in the policy statement are concluded, these will govern all subsequent shipments to those countries with which agreements are concluded. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The motion before the House is, in essence, whether a decision on the further development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry- that is, whether to permit the development of new <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mines and the export of their products- should be the subject of further debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Of course, it should not be thought that the debate commenced with the first report of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The very existence of diverse views on mining and the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was one of the reasons which led the former Government to have the commission of inquiry implemented. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Having said all that, I say bluntly to the House that on the evidence gathered so far- it is a comprehensive analysis which I have before me- the majority of Australians are not opposed to the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> given adequate safeguards over the uses to which these exports may be put and the guaranteed protection of the environment, the conservation of nature and the highest consideration for the interests of the Aboriginal people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* I am sure that the proposals will be varied if only to take account of the fact that under the circumstances in which such a decision might be taken it will need to be recognised that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> occurs widely throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* For example, on the question of waste, a committee of my Party in this Parliament recently had before it  Dr Hardy  of the Atomic Energy Commission, who was said to be a pro-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> man very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as a source of power, and I believe he is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Dr Hardy  also admitted that another proposal was floating around- I heard it first about a year ago coming from Japan and now it is coming from the United States- that those countries which sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should control the sale and ensure that the plutonium is returned to them and buried in their own country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The point I am making is that this person, who was pro-<span class="highlight">uranium</span>, was advocating the waste being buried roughly 2000 feet below the ground in special formations such as granite and salt. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* I believe that in making those submissions he strengthened the case against the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for nuclear energy purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* That figure is based on the known resources of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the world at this stage, and that is what we are talking about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* I am speaking on this issue tonight as a matter of conscience because I have a very strong and firm belief that we should be prepared to allow this debate to continue, and that the Government should be prepared to grant a moratorium on the mining and future sales of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* It should do this instead of introducing into the Parliament papers such as the one presented by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 24 May 1977 headed 'Government policy on nuclear safeguards', which is basically window dressing to give him an excuse for further mining and to allow Australia to enter into further contracts for the sale of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to countries for nuclear purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Having made those points which I think are very important, I submit very sincerely that a moratorium should be placed on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* It is now recognised as a useful emotional vote catching gimmick to discover suddenly that there are such serious risks in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia that it should not take place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* In the halcyon days of their power all they were concerned about was getting the most money for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Professor Heinz Arndt made a couple of interesting points on this topic of the morality of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate in a recent speech. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* He pointed to the comparisons between the long campaign against fluoridation of the water supply and the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> proposition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Professor Arndt points out that the present antinuclear campaign, which in Australia concentrates on opposition to mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, is clearly in this tradition of conscience radicalism. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The alternative proposition with respect to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is that nuclear fuel is much safer and much cleaner, and that has been demonstrated very adequately to be the fact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The other point I made at that time and I want to repeat it as quickly as possible, is that the failure to provide <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to power users will force the earlier arrival of the plutonium economy, which is the dangerous economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* It is fascinating that the people who are opposing the use of nuclear power and the mining of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are by their very actions forcing the power hungry nations of this world into a technology which uses hardly any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at all but which is desperately dangerous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* There is no doubt that the provision of large quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from Australia would help reduce the stranglehold that the Arab nations have on the fuel situation in this nation, and one does not have to breakfast with an Iraqi to understand that simple economic fact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* They deal with the question of risk which clearly is the crux of the anti-<span class="highlight">uranium</span> debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* The harsh commercial reality, as well as morality, forces us into supplying <span class="highlight">uranium</span> without further delay. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* Already there has been a 5-year delay in the development of this energy source in an energy hungry world, and even if the Government goes ahead as fast as it can it will be probably 1980 before we could see a reasonable level of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> production in Australia going to meet the markets for energy in this world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* It is held out to us that if Australia does not develop its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources, if we do not supply this fuel for nuclear power stations, it will dramatise the situation and encourage the rest of the world not to do likewise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* As the Fox Commission has pointed out, if Australia were to stop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and exports further low cost supplies would become available from higher cost grade ore deposits in other countries to meet any deficiency created by Australia not exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* What I want to make clear to the Australian people is that the compelling and overriding argument for the development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources is to contribute to meeting the expanding energy needs of the whole world, and not least of the developing countries, in the context of the increasingly rapid depletion of finite fossil resources, especially oil.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0)

* In the context of this established global nuclear power industry Australia, as the possessor of 20 per cent of the world's low grade <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, has a manifest responsibility to contribute to the very substantial quantities of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> needed to fuel the industry.

* Turning first to the international aspects and the questions of controlling nuclear weapons proliferation, the Government's argument that this objective would be furthered by the export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> seems to depend chiefly on the fact that this is in accord with the policy announced by  President  Carter on 7 April last. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0)

* It is difficult to believe other than that the Government decided to base <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining on the Atomic Energy Act because of the measures that this would give to it to enable it to take action against unions and people who might be trying to obstruct <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0)

* I do not share the view that nuclear energy will become too expensive and impossible to use in view of the alternatives; but, if this were so and it turned out that nuclear industry would never get off the ground, that is an argument in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining because if it is a mineral that will never be used we might as well sell it now, if we are satisfied about the safety aspects, because it will be worthless in the future.

* That is precisely what we would be doing if we were to deny the supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for peaceful purposes to customer countries which have expressed both a wish and a need for our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources- resources which in energy content are of the same order as the presently known oil reserves of Saudi Arabiaand which received a major blow from the 1973 oil crises, a repetition of which they are understandably at very great pains to avoid.

* Let me go back to the Flowers report to the United Kingdom Parliament in September 1976 which said that this is the greatest danger which the world faces; yet if a country is short of power it should by all means maximise the production to 60 per cent instead of achieving the normal low usage from natural <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* The reality of the situation is that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been mined in Australia since 1958 and for at least the last two decades <span class="highlight">uranium</span> power has been a viable source of energy, particularly in western Europe, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* The areas which are being covered by the Australian Government in terms of safeguards are the need to keep policy under constant review, a careful selection of eligible customers for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the application of effective international atomic energy safeguards, bilateral agreements with customer countries, fall-back safeguards, prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing, constant physical security, safeguard provisions in contracts and international multi-lateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* It is also worth noting, because it is of considerable importance, that as a result of the Australian Government's decision to proceed with the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Australia has been invited to join with the United States and other countries who are already in the nuclear fuel cycle program in the development of evaluation techniques which will be a further step towards ensuring that more adequate safeguards are constantly being developed.

* In terms of the problems we face with energy needs, it is worth remembering that the future demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> depends essentially on the rate of growth in electricity consumption throughout the world and upon the requirements of electricity which are to be supplied by nuclear plants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* One can perhaps ask this question: Why is it that in the Western countries we find this tendency to try to return us to the trees literally, when obviously the reality of failure to develop <span class="highlight">uranium</span> at this stage is going to leave us within the next 20 years in a most serious predicament unless massive alternative sources of fossilised fuel are found.

* These are the main points made in the report: The <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry could be earning about $3,000m per year at projected prices or about $ 1,000m per year in current-that is, 1975- money values. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* Yet on 31 October 1974 the Whitlam Labor Government detailed its policy on the mining and exporting of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in a major statement made to the Parliament by the then Minister for Minerals and Energy,  Mr Connor,  That is what he said: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* This statement is to outline the Government 's program for the rational development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources in the Northern Territory- a program which will return substantial benefits to Australia from our supply of this vital energy resource to our overseas trading partners who face such grave difficulties in securing their own energy requirements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* To enable the world to have at its disposal alternative sources of energy, we as a government are faced by the reality that if we had not made this decision, if we had not made our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves available to the world, the situation simply was that the advent of the fast breeder reactor, which regrettably I believe will come in due course, would undoubtedly be hastened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* Faced by that fundamental reality, by the knowledge that the development of the fast breeder reactor is imminent, the capacity of the NPT and IAEA or any other safeguards to regulate effectively the dissemination, and the risks associated with <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, would obviously be out of normal control at that time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* I am also very pleased to see in the Government's announcement that it is proposed that part of the revenues received from the resources tax on the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will be spent in looking for alternative sources of energy, including solar energy.

* After we had made those decisions, following upon the decisions made by the previous Liberal Government to allow the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, we were activated by the growing concern expressed in many parts of the world and not just by the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0)

* We have also had church groups writing and attacking our side for having raised the point that the Third World clearly will benefit, not directly but indirectly in terms of the price of their fuel, as a result of the Western world going nuclear and as a result of Australia providing a cheaper source of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for nuclear power stations than would otherwise be available.

* I have said, as the Fox report said, as the Flowers Report said, as the Nader book said and as every shred of evidence on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining anywhere in the world suggests, that there are three facts that have not been denied. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* The first is that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining produces wastes which contain radio toxic materials, which cause cancer and which may cause gene mutations in future generations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* A minor point which has been raised- I think by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  and others- is that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and nuclear power are not of great importance to Third World countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* Australia, by its export or failure to export <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, can have no effect on the problem of nuclear proliferation except that by exporting we do have some leverage to tighten up these admittedly defective standards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* We need not concern ourselves that the actual mining or milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> comprises any significant hazard to those involved in it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* One thing we must bear in mind is that if we become an exporter of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> we will have the power, in association with other exporters, to impose on the users of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> proper standards for the disposal of their waste so that in the disposal of that waste they do not affect others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* For his policy to work- 1 believe it is the proper policy- it would depend upon the free availability of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> so the present reactors which are in use in more than 40 countries can continue economically.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* But when the people of Australia see what is an obvious phoney- they see a government being destroyed by its incapacity to handle the economy, and suddenly it switches the issue to the question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, knowing what the reaction of sections of the trade union will be and knowing that it can create a climate of union bashing- they will see the hypocrisy and the absurdity of this as a major election issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* Very early in the public debate that has been proceeding for some time I resolved that I would not come to a final veiw on the subject until after the presentation of the two Fox reports by the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry and after I had had the opportunity of assessing some developments overseas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* If a decision by Australia not to supply <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would halt nuclear developments throughout the world i would probably be in favour of a moratorium on mining and exporting in order to resolve existing problems.

* Japan believes that if she has some part of that capacity supplied from nuclear sources, some from furnaces fuelled by fossil fuels and some from hydro-electric power, and then tries to diversify the sources of supply of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and of the fossil fuels as far as possible she will have provided the greatest possible guarantee against disruption to the sources of supply of any one of those fuels from any one part of the world.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0)

* I further note that the Trade Union Congress, as that report indicated, backed a full scale demonstration of fast breeder reactors on grounds that there might be a shortage of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and that therefore countries dependent on nuclear energy for peaceful purposes would need to conserve what supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> were available to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0)

* I think all honourable gentlemen would know that compared with the fight water reactor a fast breeder reactor makes more efficient use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but, at the same time, takes the country so involved closer to the plutonium economy which is something which has been of concern to this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0)

* It also shows that in the United Kingdom responsible unions, having a considerable number of facts available to them, having a very large number of their members dependent upon energy from nuclear supplies, recognise that countries of Europe need <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0)

* These two matters together emphasise why the ready availability of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is important in order to slow down the move towards fast breeder reactors, if that is possible, and to slow down the move towards the plutonium economy, as well as to give Australia the strongest possible voice in the world forums against nuclear proliferation and in favour of proper waste disposal as modern scientific and technological knowledge now makes possible.

* Adequate notice should be given to these industries of the kind of tax, and adequate discussion should take place in the Parliament about the tax, instead of the Government practising sleight of hand and imposing a tax which applies only to the oil industry in Bass Strait and some potential industry in <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* It would be possible for members to talk in this House on the scientific points of view relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, but I think it is important that we confine our comments to the political points of view because the effects of the Government's decision on the mining and export of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> are essentially political.

* Professor Baxter said that if less <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is available in a world in which we are looking for better energy technologies during the interim period when we will try to produce technologies that are far less harmful than the potentials for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, there will be more pressure on some of the other energy resources, for instance, on fossil fuels and particularly oil resources.

* Although the United States, Japan, France, West Germany and other countries are busily searching for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Brazil, Africa, Indonesia and elsewhere, several years of very extensive and expensive drilling have not yet produced the desired results.

* Firstly, the current, possibly artificial, shortage of long term, cheap <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies is prompting big consumers such as Japan, West Germany and France to explore vigorously overseas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* Their targets are mostly the less developed nations, for example Brazil, whose size alone may almost guarantee the presence of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* Although nuclear facilities may not be immediately needed in the host countries, the exploring countries are likely to offer technology as they are in Brazil for power reactors, together with enrichment and reprocessing plants, in return for a generous slice of whatever <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is found. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* Secondly, the pace of developments of fast breeder reactors at least partly depends on available supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* When <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is rare as a result of scarcity or export bans the breeder's sixty-fold utilisation rate of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> over conventional reactors becomes an overwhelming advantage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* Whilst it is difficult to gauge the exact effectiveness of an Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> moratorium on nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism there could well be a beneficial indirect leverage possible on suppliers of sensitive nuclear technology who themselves need large supplies of cheap <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for power reactors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* But the question is whether a blanket 2-year to 5-year export ban with its across the board effect on all consumers can be more useful than the Government's announcement that those nuclear nations not agreeing to improved safeguards and restricted technology transfer would selectively miss out on short term and long term supplies of our cheap <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* The latter course has the advantage of being more credible, of establishing Australia as a nuclear fuel supplier accepted with respect in the world's decision making <span class="highlight">uranium</span> forums, of being more effective against dissident countries such as France and of reflecting our international energy responsibilities.

* I can assure him that over a considerable period of time a number of government departments, including the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Resources, as it now is, and its predecessor departments, have been involved in an on-going fashion in analysing the economic implications to Australia of the development and sensible exploitation of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reserves.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-14-0)

* The honourable member will recall that when the Australian Labor Party Government was in office the Department of Health was instructed to draw up a code for the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> ores and the Government regards that code as being probably the most advanced code of its type in the world.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27)

* But apparently the Prime Minister has missed the very saliant point that even though those nations may not use our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to manufacture weapons the arrangements will release to them other stocks of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> with which to manufacture weapons.

* I say again that if the record of that debate in the Senate is read objectively, it will be seen that the opposition in the Senate was only because of the one fact that the move was an attempt to nationalise the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27)

* A much more important implication is that here we have a succession of Opposition members saying how dreadful it is to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, yet in 1974 so intent were they on mining, milling and exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> that they were willing to nationalise the industry to do it.

* -The introduction of the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 demonstrates in the clearest possible way that the Government has failed to take seriously the criticisms of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry of the use of the Atomic Energy Act as a vehicle for the commercial development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* Meanwhile, the decisions and recommendations in favour of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> reprocessing in European countries, the refusal of France and West Germany to reconsider the sale of reprocessing technologies, the refusal of India to ratify the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty all undermine the INFCE talks.

* When this proposed amendment is taken in conjunction with the changes proposed for section 38 of the Act, dealing with the regulatory powers of the Minister, it is clear that the Government is seeking extensive, direct power over the mining, processing, transportation and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the States.

* If we look back at the history of the development and the fulfilment of Australian contracts to provide <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to energy scarce countries, we notice that the Whitlam Government tabled in the Parliament on 31 October 1974 a statement announcing a program of large-scale <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development in the Northern Territory, commencing with the exploitation of the Ranger deposit, to be followed by the development of the Nabarlek and other deposits.

* All told, the use of this piece of legislation to cover commercial <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining ventures in a climate of growing public hostility to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and export, poses a serious threat to civil liberties and to the industrial rights of a significant section of the Australian work force.

* If the Government decided to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development authority should be established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* I made the point that we need new bodies, and I mentioned a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development authority and said that its functions ought to include those in Section 17(1 )(A) to (D) in the present Atomic Energy Act, with the deletion of any reference to encouragement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* Proposed section 38(2) provides that regulations may be made to prohibit the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> except under licence granted by the Federal Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* One of the real fears that people have about nuclear power is that not only are there safety and safeguards considerations to worry about but that in both <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exporting countries and countries that use nuclear power there are very real threats to civil liberties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Atomic Energy Act 1953 as part of a package of legislation giving effect to the Government's decision on the further development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* A fundamental element of the decision announced in this House on 25 August 1 977 was that development of the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit would proceed on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Whitlam Government and Peko Mines Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition pointed out, in 1953  Sir Marcus  stated that the great amount of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide to be mined in Australia presented Australia with an economic future of which the great majority of comparable nations would certainly be very envious. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* It all seems to hinge around what one could describe reasonably and fairly as almost a psychotic reaction to fear in relation to the possible abuse and misuse of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide from Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* I would have thought from what I have read of  Sir Marcus  Oliphant 's recent views that his concern applies less to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide than it does to homo sapiens or the human beings who are likely to be in a position to abuse and to misuse oxide produced in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition then went on to talk about Australia's responsibility being the equivalent of that of the United States, particularly after the export of the yellowcake <span class="highlight">uranium</span> oxide had commenced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* The interesting thing about the speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, in contrast to the speech of the former  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  was the relevation that the Australian Labor Party has in mind plans which would almost certainly indicate that it envisaged the development of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export industry and subsequently the establishment of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry development authority in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* He referred to the need for a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry development authority- an authority to be responsible for standards- thereby giving the indication that he had no confidence at all in Australian companies to maintain standards which would be acceptable within their own organisations and which would be to the advantage of their own people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* Tell us more about the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* Let us have the truth, for it is quite clear at least from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the reality is that the Australian Labor Party is well aware of the fact that there will be a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry and that there will be plans for its development in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0)

* I think also that the Government should realise that amending legislation to gain a short term relief in our balance of payments crisis or for any of the other purposes which have been brought forward during the debate, such as to promote the accelerated processing, mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, should not take precedence over justice to our oppressed indigenous people, which is the theme which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs very rightly has stressed from the outset of his accepting the Aboriginal Affairs Ministry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* It is my purpose to argue that that right to justice should take precedence over any supposed urgency to promote a package of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* Previous Opposition speakers on this cluster of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> Bills have made it clear that there are alternatives to nuclear power; that there are alternatives to a headlong and hellbent development at all costs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* We can offer the world a better solution than <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining to all the problems which <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is supposed to solve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* We hear that all the world is crying out for <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* That submission expresses the view, based on much sounder evidence than the evidence on which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> lobbyists base their arguments, that the waste problem, the security problem, can be solved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* So let us not kid ourselves that the Government's package of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is the best answer to the problems which the Government is posing- the problems of our need to export, our need for a better balance of payments, our need to meet the world's energy needs or whatever. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* We are very severely limited as to time, but I seek the Minister's assurance, if he can give it- I trust that eventually he will- that he will include the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases, as recommended by the Fox report, in the Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> areas in the Alligator Rivers region, or that he will in some way include those leases in the land rights proposals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government's decisions on the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry as far as they affect Aboriginal land rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* There is one other aspect of the Minister's speech which has relevance to the sheaf of Bills dealing with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> issue which we have been discussing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* As I have indicated these are aimed at <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export first, not Aboriginal rights first. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* There is no justification for this headlong and heedless rush into the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> when the demand for it is winding down, when the whole world is having second thoughts and when here, in the city of Canberra, a reasonable, sensible and sane alternative has been neglected since May 1976. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* This Bill is, of course, linked with the numbers of important Bills designed to give effect to the implementation of the second Fox report, the proper name of that report being the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* It is important, if the general package of Bills relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is to proceed- we have already voted on that in the House tonight- that the amendments to give effect to the protection of Aboriginal interests are carried into legislative form. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* They were seen as being important in the framework of legislation that would permit <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining if the Government made the decision to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* This Bill is important because it seeks to protect the interests of the Aboriginal people who live in the region and whose rights are affected by <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* Provision is made also for providing funds so that, before any moneys become available from the source of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, the land councils will have funds with which to operate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Government has failed to do this and has put all its energy eggs in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> producers' baskets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0)

* The first is that the apparent availability and the alleged ease of exploitation of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is a major disincentive in Australia to the development of solar, tidal, wind and other nonpolluting, non-exhaustible energy sources, leading to almost indefinite deferment of and a low priority for developing alternative energy sources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0)

* It is apparently felt that because Australia has ample reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, there is no need to develop an energy policy here very seriously. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0)

* 1, page 98, is the Bureau of Mineral Resources at present gathering and disseminating geological and geophysical information relevant to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exploration; if so, where. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-32)

* Has the Bureau disseminated this type of information in the past; if so, which companies have taken <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining leases on sites first discovered and surveyed by the Bureau. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-32)

* Current geological and geophysical investigation of the Pine Creek Geosyncline and the McArthur Basin in the Northern Territory and the Westmoreland/Mount Isa and Georgetown areas in Queensland are providing information and ideas which are basic to the search for ore deposits including <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-32)

* Some emphasis was placed on areas thought to have <span class="highlight">uranium</span> potential in the Northern Territory in the early 1 950 's and again in the late 1 960 's as the search for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> was accorded a high priority at those times. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-32)

* Work done by the BMR has contributed in varying degrees towards the discovery of a number of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> prospects in the same way as it has done towards the discovery of other mineral prospects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-32)

* The Government's policy on Aboriginal land rights has been clearly stated, particularly in my second reading speech on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and my statement of 23 August on the Government's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> decisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-41)

* -The view of the Australian Labor Party on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining is well known and has been covered fully by previous speakers in the debate concerning the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* The three Bills that we are now debating deal primarily with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Northern Territory and in particular in the Alligator Rivers region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* These three Bills- the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill amending the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill- are based on recommendations of the second Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry, better known as the second Fox report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* As is well known, the second report dealt specifically with the effect of the Ranger proposals in the Alligator Rivers region whereas the first report had dealt with the larger question of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, including the dangers of mining and milling, the operation of nuclear reactors, the problems associated with the safe disposal of nuclear waste, the dangers of the diversion of fissile material for terrorist purposes and the dangers of the diversion of fissile material for nuclear weapons, that is, the problem of nuclear proliferation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* One then needs to turn to the second Fox report to see what effect <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining would have in the Alligator Rivers region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* We should remember that the second Fox report dealt primarily with the proposed Ranger <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mine at Jabiru. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* Let me just quote a few sections of the second Fox report to indicate how little knowledge we have concerning the effects of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* How is it possible, on the basis of the repeated statements by the Fox Commission that it simply does not know what will happen in the Magela Creek system if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining goes ahead, that the Government could come to the conclusion that there would be adequate safeguards of the environment of the proposed Kakadu National Park? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* However, if one considers that the Jabiluka mine seepage would flow into the Magela Creek and the Koongarra mine seepage into the Norlangie Creek and thence into the South Alligator River, the only possible conclusion that one could arrive at is that the Government by its approval of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in the Alligator Rivers region is prepared to place at risk one of the world's great wildlife sanctuaries, and certainly Australia's greatest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* We shall oppose the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the catchment area of the Alligator Rivers region within the Kakadu National Park whilst not opposing the declaration of the Park itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* Stage one will be declared immediately and is denned in a map released with the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> package of last year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* In the case of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, with its contaminants flowing into the water systems, the effects can and probably will be spread throughout a large portion of the region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* These various destructive elements include contaminants from the mine site such as copper, lead, zinc, <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, thorium radium, manganese, cadmium, molybdenum, iron, mercury, chromium, nickel, arsenic, magnesium, calcium, ammonia, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, bicarbonate and suspended solids. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* Our major concern with the co-ordinating committee is that 90 per cent of those people who comprise it will be representatives of government agencies and mining companiesorganisations that have a total commitment to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* In the mining and milling of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- and this is not at the stage where it is likely to be made into some sort of nuclear weapon, we are talking only about the mining and milling of it- we have reached the point where the project is already part of the defence system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* It is supposed to be concerned primarily with the mining, milling and, I assume, marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* They are environmentally unsound, they are unnecessarily oppressive and restrictive of people's civil liberties, and they further the cause of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining, to which the Australian Labor Party is opposed until adequate safeguards have been found. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0)

* That will mean that 90 per cent of the people on the Co-ordinating Committee will have a vested interest, a committed interest, in <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35)

* Then there would be representatives from Pancontinental Mining Ltd, Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Mines Pty Ltd and Noranda Australia Ltd. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35)

* This would provide a balance between those people who are committed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and those people in the Austraiian community who have a concern for and interest in the future of the Kakadu National Park. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35)

* The other point which I think is relevant is related to the creation of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35)

* Regrettably we will be engaged in the mining, milling and marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35)

* But, taken together, they deal with the need to make an early start on the mining and development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources, whilst at the same time ensuring adequate protection of the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region, protection of the rights and legitimate interests of the Aborigines in the region, protection of the safety of persons engaged in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, and the development of adequate safeguards to prevent proliferation of the nuclear armament industry.

* The only energy source which can enable us to do this over the next several decades is <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* The world needs <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to generate electric power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* The use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> for electricity generation is already an established fact of life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* What amazes me about the debate in this country in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is that those people who oppose <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and the development of resources seem to be taking the view that it is a new industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* That is not to say that our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> should or would be sold primarily to developing nations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* Many of them would not have the infrastructure or other facilities to utilise <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in this way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* Nor would they all have the necessary sophistication or perhaps willingness to abide by the stringent safeguard provisions which the Australian Government has so rightly laid down as an essential condition of the sale of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- safeguards which are more stringent than those applied by any other <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplier in the world.

* If those nations utilise increasing proportions of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as electricity generating fuel that will ease the pressure of their demand on oil and coal for this purpose, thereby enabling the developing nations to procure those energy sources more readily and at lower cost.

* As the Minister said when introducing the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which is designed to establish an office of a supervising scientist, a co-ordinating committee and a research institute for the region, it is the co-ordinating committee which will be the focal point of the system proposed by the Government for the protection of the environment from the consequences of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operations in the region.

* I can only express the hope and the confidence that the Council and all other interested parties will work together constructively and co-operatively to further the interests of all Australians through the early controlled development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and the necessary protection of this remarkable ecosystem.

* Since those earlier recommendations two factors that have come into consideration have been the recognition of  Aboriginal  land tights and the inquiries that were carried out into that subject and, of course, the discovery of substantial deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the area.

* Whilst I have mentioned these three mining areas- we understand that more than one of them will start at the same time- that are in the park yet not in the park, we know that examinations have shown that there are other vast deposits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> contained in the area of the Kakadu National Park.

* The Bill envisages that the national Director will have a central role in the protection of the environment and in the enforcement of environmental controls, whether relating to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining or not, in the area comprised in the national park or in any conservation zone, pending the extension of the national park.

* However, we should be aware that in August 1977 the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcom Fraser),  as part of the package statement on the development and use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia, gave notice that there would be nation-wide regulations controlling the use and the transport of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and codes concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> use. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* One State government- South Australiahas taken the view, I believe properly, that it is not going to mine <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in its State because it is not satisfied that proper safeguards have been made at the international level.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* 
 - Mr Chairman, I will go directly to the clauses we are debating and point out the fact that the codes which are the subject of the amendments are part of our obligation under international agreements that presently exist and which this Government will be proposing in forums to see that there is a universal approach to safeguards and environmental standards which will apply to the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The amendments and this code which the Government has come up with after a great deal of consideration after receiving the report of the Fox inquiry are specifically designed to provide that level and degree of environmental protection which is absolutely basic to the mining and treatment of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* These are the sorts of provisions which any country involved in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> cycle should regard as absolutely basic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* In August of last year the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  wrote to all the States and said that the Government was going to try to bring in uniform codes of environment protection for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Did the Prime Minister write to the South Australian Premier in August last year saying that there would be full consultation with the States in developing uniform legislation for the mining and export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Is it a fact that there were no discussions with the States prior to the announcement last week that Bills concerning <span class="highlight">uranium</span> would be introduced into the House today? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* That means just what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said it means: That the real power of deciding the codes of practice for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining outside the Northern Territory or any other Commonwealth Territory certainly is in the hands of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* In other words, the codes of practice for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at, say, Mary Kathleen will be a matter for BjelkePetersen, and at Yeelirrie in Western Australia they will be a matter for Premier Court and his colleagues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* It has said that it will sell <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to certain countries but that certain safeguards have to be observed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* For instance, one safeguard states that there will not be any reprocessing, because after reprocessing plutonium and unused <span class="highlight">uranium</span> can be extracted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* So clause 12 seeks to give the Commonwealth Parliament the maximum amount of power and we agree that that power should be used to protect the people of Australia to the maximum extent in relation to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining if <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining commences in August during the next couple of years.

* I then went on to debate whether there ought to be <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and later said: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* If there is to be <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining this sort of legislation is necessary . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The codes can be put into practice in the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia or any State where <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining takes place only if the Governor of that State- I presume that means the State Government- requests those regulations to be put into practice in that State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* If this Government really wants to reassure the potential miners of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the people who will be transporting the material mined, it will amend this legislation to put it back to its original form because that is the only form which offers protection to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The problem is that they, like other honourable members opposite, are totally opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and seek to obstruct every Bill on this issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* We have given them a chance to express themselves and now we are giving them the opportunity to create their own codes and their own legislation on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* If these honourable members had followed what has been said since August last year when the decisions on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining were announced they would see that what we are saying now is completely consistent with what we were saying then. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* It was so ravenous in its attempt to reap the profits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> it did not care whether the matter concerned Aboriginals, the environment, the States or anything else. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* It simply regards it as political expediency to reap the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> out of the ground. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* As I was saying, clause 13 of the original Bill provides for the ultimate takeover of responsibilities by the Commonwealth in an emergency situation, and obviously the situations that are imagined- as far as the Government is concerned anyway- are civil disturbances or actions against the mining and transport of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Also there is a possible situation that could arise regarding the development of hazards from the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Firstly, there is the assault upon civil liberties, and secondly, we are utterly and completely opposed to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining at this stage because there is no known way to dispose of nuclear waste, and because the safeguards- such as the international atomic energy agency safeguards that the Government is depending upon, and also bilateral agreements and signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty- are just not sufficient to guarantee that Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will not be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* They said at the time that their objections were based, firstly, upon the assault upon civil liberties inherent in clause 13, and secondly, because clause 13 might pave the way for an ultimate Federal direction that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining may proceed in the States against the wishes of the State government that may be in power at that particular time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* It was not- and this is important- because they objected to safety procedures to govern <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining and transport in the ultimate eventuality of that going ahead. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* But when we look at what has happened in these amendments- firstly, the one we have already dealt with, sub-clause (5)- does that really mean that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining can still proceed if the States object and there are no safety procedures whatsoever? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Does sub-clause (6) really mean that if a real nuclear hazard did develop- one could easily imagine it, I will put forward a hypothetical situation in a moment- the States could override the Commonwealth, override the wishes of the workers and order that <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining could go ahead and must go ahead? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* To members of the Opposition that means that if the States objected to a Commonwealth direction to stop, the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining could still go ahead. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* We think that it does and that is what we object to because this is the sort of situation that could develop at, say, Ranger It might be remembered that the Fox Inquiry was told that mill tailings, which if exposed to the atmosphere give off radon gas for a hundred thousand years, would be stored under water and  Mr Justice  Fox said that was no good and they should be buried in the empty mine after the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> has been taken out, and I understand that will happen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Under this amendment the Queensland Government could say to the Commonwealth that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining must still proceed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The whole parcel ought to be withdrawn, and if he is still determined to go ahead with the nefarious activity of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining he should come up with something better than the ultimate result of these Senate mutilated Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The development of those resources, while serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the environment and the welfare of the Aboriginal people, and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* Central to this aspect of our policy is the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority be established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* In my statement of 25 August 1977 I stated that the Government accepted the thrust of the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry and that we would establish a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority or similar marketing arrangements to achieve the objective of orderly development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* But I made clear that in the arrangements we made we would ensure that the Government had at all times proper knowledge, oversight and control over the arrangements under which Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is exported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* That control would always ensure that the Government would be in a position to move immediately to terminate <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development, permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* Against the above background the Government has considered carefully its attitude in regard to the machinery which should govern future exports of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and I shall now explain to the House the decisions we have taken at this stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> exports are prohibited unless a certificate in writing under the hand of the Minister for Trade and Resources, or an officer duly authorised by him, is produced to the Collector of Customs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* In considering exports we will have regard to the principles I have already stated, some of which I now repeat briefly, namely: The orderly development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources; making supplies of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> available to other countries for use in the generation of electricity and for other peaceful purposes; ensuring adherence to the policies of Australia in relation to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the application of safeguards against the use of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> other than for peaceful purposes.. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Minister will also determine terms and conditions relating to the duration of the contract, the quantity of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be sold under the contract, the method of shipment of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the price payable for the <span class="highlight">uranium</span>, the manner- including the currencyof payment and the use to which the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is to be put by the purchaser.

* When a contract has been entered into in accordance with the requirements that the Minister has notified beforehand, the producers will be required to lodge a copy of the contract with the Minister, whereupon it will be formally approved and form the basis for subsequent export approvals covering the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be exported in fulfilment of the contract. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* Shipments of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> will continue to be controlled, as is the case at present, on the basis of individual consignment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* These include the requirements that the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> is being exported from a project which has the status of Government development approval; that the export is for the purpose of performing an approved contract; and that the Australian safeguards policy is fully complied with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* I have referred to the Government's previously stated view that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> marketing authority or similar arrangements should be established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* This body would be appropriately named the Australian <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Export Authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* I envisage that at the appropriate time in our progress with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export authority should be established to be charged with the duty of advising the Minister for Trade and Resources on the matters I have just outlined in relation to exports under new contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* Such an authority would also carry out a number of important ancillary functions, namely: To assemble and to correlate information relating to the known reserves of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and in other countries; to obtain and analyse information on the supply of and demand for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in Australia and other countries; to analyse trends in the international <span class="highlight">uranium</span> market; to obtain information on the commercial arrangements for the upgrading and enrichment of Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> within and outside Australia.

* I might add that in view of the nature of the advice that the Authority would need to provide, it would not be appropriate for its members to be chosen from the companies which were participating in the marketing of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* The machinery and the procedures I have just outlined will ensure that the Government maintains strong regulation and control over <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports in the national interest in a manner consistent with the Government's policy of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> development announced on 25 August 1 977 following receipt of the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry.

* However, given the import of it and the impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry I think it would have been reasonable if the Government had demonstrated some confidence in the confidentiality that the Opposition would observe and had given it much prior notice of a statement of this nature.

* Although looking to the eventual development of the Jabiluka <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit, the Government is nevertheless committed to not making a final decision on whether the Jabiluka project should proceed until the environmental effects of the project, both physical and social, is satisfied . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* That is hardly a firm recommendation for the development of Pancontinental; yet the Government will go ahead knowing that in the Magela Creek system there will be two tailings dams, two acid plants, two slake lime plants, and, if one reads aspects of the Fox report about the impact of seepage and the amount of water seepage from the dams, assessments of both Ranger and Pancontinental in the Magela Creek system, obviously the Government even given the fact that it is prepared to go ahead with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia, in clear contrast to the policy of the Opposition, should proceed only with Ranger and not Pancontinental. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* I hope that other honourable members on this side of the House will have an opportunity to participate fully in the debate on what is probably one of the most important statements the Government has yet made on the development of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* The whole basis of this <span class="highlight">uranium</span> business has to be made clear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* The situation is that this Government has not faced up to the fact that while it mines <span class="highlight">uranium</span> without the appropriate safeguards on the world scene, it is contributing to a nuclear war. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* Frankly, I think it is madness- if I can use that term- for this Government to proceed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining in Australia when so many problems remain unresolved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* I asked in this House on Monday and Tuesday whether, when the Government cannot sell its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> overseas with its so-called stringent safeguards, it will cave in to countries like Iran, the Philippines and the European Atomic Energy Community, which will not stand by and lose their sovereignty in a bilateral agreement to a small country like Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0)

* If it gives in to a few conservative reactionary senators who represent the most conservative forces in this country, it certainly will surrender to those countries from which it wants to get revenue from <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining.

* The question of appropriate legislation dealing with the export of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the establishment of a marketing authority, or what we will term the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> export authority, has been examined very closely by our legal officers.

* 
 - Sir John Hill, the  Chairman  of the British Atomic Energy Agency, visited me this week to bring me up to date with activities in Britain relating to the nuclear fuel cycle but principally to find out what progress has been made in Australia with the development of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and the prospects of future exports of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0)

* He mentioned specifically that Britain was interested in purchasing from 1982 onwards 1,300 tonnes of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> a year to meet its requirements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0)

* Did he hear a radio news report today in which  Sir Charles  Court was reported as saying that the Yeelirrie <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposit in Western Australia would be developed before Ranger because there will be no bureaucratic interference, and that Western Australia is planning for the installation of a nuclear power reactor? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-19-0)

* The understanding that I have of the Western Mining project at Yeelirrie is that the company is at the moment seeking environmental approval to put in a research plant to test the feasibility of a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining operation at Yeelirrie. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-19-0)

* So there is no substance whatsoever in statements that Yeelirrie is likely to come in before the Ranger project and it is quite wrong to make statements that that project can go ahead without the satisfactory environmental impact statements that are required before any <span class="highlight">uranium</span> project is approved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-19-0)

* It is true that there was a claim, in one instance, for 36 per cent of gross profits of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining carried out on Aboriginal land to be paid to Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0)

* There were many clauses in this Bill and, for that matter, in other legislation which we have debated recently- I refer especially to the package of Bills which dealt with the mining of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>- in respect of which we managed to battle our way through to get some representations accepted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34)

* External affairs, defence in some aspects at least, and customs tariffs are obvious cases, but others might need to be added, such as coinage and legal tender as well as, of course, the major matters of Aboriginal land rights, <span class="highlight">uranium</span> and related matters.

* Finally, may I add that when agreement is eventually reached under the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory for the mining or <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region, we will see the full flowering of the land rights granted to the Aboriginals in the Northern Territory as a consequence of the deliberate action by the Liberal-National Country Party Government to put Aboriginals in a position that they have never occupied before in the history of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* As I said, we will see the full flowering of land rights legislation when that agreement is finally entered into by the Northern Land Council with respect to mining at Ranger and subsequently with those other companies that wish to exploit the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> deposits of Aboriginal traditional land.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-7)

* One of the principal areas of difference between the Government's approach to the whole matter of the utilisation of Australia's <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources and that which is advanced by some of our opponents is that we see <span class="highlight">uranium</span> as a means to help to overcome the critical shortage of energy to meet energy requirements in an energy-hungry world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0)

* So it can be seen that the extent to which Australia can get its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exported and contributing towards this generation of nuclear energy is significantly going to help the power needs of an energy-hungry world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0)

* Therefore, I think that suggestions that there should be anything but an acceleration of our development of our <span class="highlight">uranium</span> resources need to be put properly in perspective. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0)

* I said that nuclear fissionable material is either highly enriched <span class="highlight">uranium</span> or pure plutonium and that the Government had hitherto said that it wished to approve all such enrichment or reprocessing but that the Prime Minister had said that, from this point on, he would have a complete prohibition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-31)

* Accordingly, the Government has decided that forthwith: Firstly, proposals for foreign investment in new projects will not require government approval under the foreign investment guidelines unless the project involves an investment of $5m or more- this does not apply to investment in the financial sector and <span class="highlight">uranium</span>; secondly, in the case of investments coming within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act, the Government will not normally seek to intervene if the assets of the company being taken over are less than $2m, unless there are special circumstances or the business is in the financial sector or some other area where special considerations apply; and, thirdly, individual real estate acquisitions of less than $250,000 will no longer require approval.

* On the other hand, in the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry, decisions of the United States Government to protect <span class="highlight">uranium</span> miners in the United States broke down vertical integration in the industry during the 1960s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0)

* As the United States military needs for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> declined at the end of the 1950s, the United States decided against renewal of its <span class="highlight">uranium</span> purchase contracts with Canada and South Africa, thereby creating a glut of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> which lasted until the 1970s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0)

* As countries buying the reactor wanted to buy <span class="highlight">uranium</span> on the international buyers' market, the United States was forced in 1964 to accept a system of 'toll enrichment'- that is, selling enrichment services on <span class="highlight">uranium</span> from whatever source for a customer country.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0)

* The resultant embargo on the use of non-US <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in the US market contributed to a depression of world <span class="highlight">uranium</span> prices to the level of $5 per lb or less, too low to cover production costs and even more so to give producers the necessary cash flow for the exploration needed to assure future supplies.

* The efforts of producer countries other than the US, acting in concert, aimed at remedying the situation were slowly beginning to produce results when suddenly, in 1974, the situation was reversed and the shortage emerged again, accompanied by its inevitable counterpart- a considerable increase in the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span>.

* In the process, the fact that Westinghouse had not bought <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to cover its contracts came to light and Westinghouse could not, and cannot, meet its contract commitments at the contracted prices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0)

* The purpose of this legislation is to draw the line and make the point that it is absurd for a country not exporting <span class="highlight">uranium</span> to be accused of fixing the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> in a country not importing <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0)

* In the normal course, most Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> exports would be converted to <span class="highlight">uranium</span> hexafluoride and enriched in the United States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0)

* Of course Westinghouse found, when the price of <span class="highlight">uranium</span> went up, that it was no longer able to obtain its supplies at a price that enabled it to sell to its purchasers at either a profit or at a break-even figure.

* This means that if, for example, Australia provides 40 per cent of the Republic of Korea's- or any other country's- <span class="highlight">uranium</span> supplies, those <span class="highlight">uranium</span> atoms will undoubtedly be mixed with <span class="highlight">uranium</span> atoms obtained from other countries and the extent of our eventual fallback safeguards controls will be proportional only to the 40 per cent of our supply.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-21-0)

* Honourable members will remember that one of the principal recommendations of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Environmental Inquiry was that a <span class="highlight">uranium</span> advisory council should be established to advise the Government and report to Parliament with regard to the export and use of Austraiian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> having in mind the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of nuclear energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-21-0)

* As honourable members will see from the report, the Council has been most industrious in informing itself on issues related to the nuclear fuel cycle and it has had already initiated studies of several issues which it sees as relevant to the development of the <span class="highlight">uranium</span> industry in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-21-0)

* The extensive briefings provided to the Council by departments and related statutory bodies, referred to in the Council's report, reflect the Government's desire that the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council be fully informed on matters of Government policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-21-0)

* In formulating the role and functions of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council, the Government was conscious of the suggestion of the Ranger inquiry that the Council should have a substantial  degree of independence and be able to undertake periodic reviews of Government policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-21-0)

* I consider that the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council has an important role to play which will not only involve it in responding to matters referred to it by the Government from time to time, but also will require the Council to demonstrate a significant measure of initiative in order to establish the level of public confidence envisaged by the Ranger inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-21-0)

* As I previously advised the House, this interest exposes the falseness of the argument of those people who say that there is no market for or interest in <span class="highlight">uranium</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)

* Indeed, in regard to the period beyond the late 1980s, the question is not whether there will be a market for <span class="highlight">uranium</span> but whether there will be a productive capacity available to meet the requirements of the reactors then in use. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)

* There can be no question that the orderly development now of the Australian <span class="highlight">uranium</span> mining industry will not only bring economic benefits to this country, both over the next decade and beyond, but also it will make an essential contribution to world energy requirements to the overall betterment of future international economic stability and prosperity.

* I refer to the first report of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council, a report which is sent to the Minister under the name of  Sir Laurence  McIntyre, a former distinguished public servant and  chairman  of this body, a man not given to this kind of expression unless there is good cause.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)

* The report of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council and a letter sent by it to the Minister are very interesting. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)

* That is, some members of the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council: that if a sale of the Government's holdings in Ranger is to take place it should be made to a consortium of demonstrably Australian companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)

* That is, the Government may want to sell out on Australia but obviously the bureaucrats involved in the <span class="highlight">Uranium</span> Advisory Council are tendering advice to the Government that it should not sell Ranger. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0)
