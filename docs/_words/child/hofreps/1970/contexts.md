* Also, what will be the ages of the children who will attend these classes It is more essential than ever that some form of teaching be introduced to the school when it is considered that the New South Wales survey on this problem revealed that about 47 per cent of the children come from homes where no English is spoken lt is probably true to say that this form of planning, when expanded, must prove of benefit to the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and particularly to the harassed teacher who is endeavouring to transmit knowledge to a percentage of the class who simply do not know what is being said.

* There are the question of educating migrant children, the question of the extension and improvement of adult education in one or more parts of the world, and the question of an intensive language course for migrants better versed in some skill or other who possibly are already acquainted with the rudiments of the English language and are better able to comprehend an intensive course than are others.

* Speaking generally, the teachers at this school said that children of migrant parents measure up quite well academically with the Australian born <span class="highlight">child</span>, but that many find their task made much harder by their struggle with English, particularly in some cases because of the habit, or insistence, of parents in speaking their native tongue in the home.

* When we are talking about citizenship education in the context of migrant education one of the points that should be considered at least is the question of instructing Australian children in the same schools and certainly in schools in areas where a large proportion of the migrant children come from one country, be it Italy, Greece or Turkey. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0)

* By contrast to the $ 1, 000m to which I have referred and which is distributed in this rather regressive way - 1 repeat, this is for the year ended 30th June 1969 - is an item which appears in the Budget for the same year described as cash benefits to persons, namely, amounts paid by reason of social services, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, medical and pharmaceutical benefits and so on.

* I have made the suggestion before as a sort of rough improvement in equity that if the concessions for dependants - that is, wives and children - were doubled for everybody - I accept the fact that they would be doubled for the wealthy as well as for the poor - and if all other deductions were eliminated the saving to revenue would be about $200m as a consequence and the majority of taxpayers were dependants, particularly those families where there there is only one breadwinner, would be advantaged if that were the case.

* Take the new education concession, which in this Budget has gone from $300 to $400 per <span class="highlight">child</span>: For a man on a taxable income of $20,000 this is worth to him $266 in rough terms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* The fact is that while education expenses under the Act include those for uniforms, fares, fees, books, etc., the fares alone with regard to children travelling long distances and who go home during the year - surely they are entitled to do that - would be very close to the allowable maximum deduction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* So even if the <span class="highlight">child</span> went home only once during the school year it would mean that at least half the maximum amount would be used up on fares. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* In giving consideration to these amendments it must be borne in mind also that like every other form of concessional deduction such as for spouse, medical costs, children, etc., the amount of deduction is not a direct deduction from taxation itself but simply a reduction in actual income for the purpose of arriving at the income upon which tax will be imposed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* The fact that deductions apply to actual incomes and not to the tax itself means, for instance, that this proposed SI CO addition to the education allowance will give to a taxpayer with one <span class="highlight">child</span> attending school and on an otherwise taxable income of $1,500  -  that is, of course, if he can afford to spend $400 on the education of his <span class="highlight">child</span> - an actual tax reduction of approximately $16 while another taxpayer with a taxable income of $15,000 and with one <span class="highlight">child</span> at school could gain a tax saving of approximately $58 - $16 in one case and $58 in the other. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* This could be a fact even though both taxpayers live in the same street and meet exactly the same education expenses for children attending the same school. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* Of course when there are 2 children in each family, or 3 or 4, then the man with a higher income gets an even greater advantage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* As a matter of fact it is obvious from taxation statistics that the great bulk of the taxpayers obtain very little real help from the existing allowance of $300, and those same taxpayers will receive no benefit at all from any increase whether it be $100 or $1,000, for the very simple reason that the low income earner cannot afford to pay out $6 or $8 a week for the education of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, or twice or three times that amount if he has 2 or 3 children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* million to  4i  million taxpayers with incomes of less than that amount, while taxpayers with incomes above $6,000 total only approximately 660,000, which proves, as I said earlier, that the great bulk of the taxpayers will gain very little from the additional $100 and that where any benefit is gained it will go largely to those who actually do not require it and in fact are well situated to meet the cost of their children's education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* For instance, that group of taxpayers whose incomes ranged from $417 to $1,599 in 1968-69 claimed an average amount of approximately $57 a <span class="highlight">child</span> for some 64,500 children of over one million taxpayers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* It is quite clear from those figures that those taxpayers and those children will derive no benefit at all from this increase of $100, and they would in most instances be stretching the purse even to reach the $57. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* Then we have the group whose incomes range from $2,400 to $2,599, a group comprising approximately 252,000 taxpayers and 89,000-odd children with an average claim of $75. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* There are something like 320,000 taxpayers in the income group up to $6,000 who have 3 or more children and it is quite obvious that those taxpayers, except in a few instances, would find it very difficult and in fact impossible to pay out more than perhaps $50 or $60 towards each of their children's education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* Therefore the children's education suffers and the best this Government can do is to increase the concessional deduction which does absolutely nothing for these taxpayers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0)

* But the Government obviously does not accept that view because in all States of Australia today there are hundreds of children whose chances of gaining a good education are very remote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* Indeed, it goes further than the <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* The parents of children in isolated areas have certain alternatives which can be boiled down to 3 choices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* As a result of the Government's proposal to change over from double side band to single side band radio the cost of replacing sets could be beyond the financial capacity of many parents, and unless some assistance is given in that regard we will see ourselves in a situation where the School of the Air will not be available to some of these children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* The third and certainly the best choice as far as the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s education is concerned is to send the <span class="highlight">child</span> to the metropolitan area or elsewhere where good schooling facilities and accommodation are available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* Air or train fares are expensive items, particularly if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is to return home at the end of each term or during school holidays - and surely it must be in the best interests of the children if they are allowed to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* One frequently hears complaints from city dwellers in relation to the cost of education, and I think they are genuine in their complaints, but how much greater must be the complaint and how much more is it justified from people in the country and outback areas as compared with the city people, and how much greater is the worry of the parents in remote areas as to the adequacy of their <span class="highlight">child</span>'s education? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* In other words, a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is born and lives in the city areas has about a 50 per cent greater chance of completing his secondary education than the <span class="highlight">child</span> who lives in one of the country areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* If we look at the central suburbs of Melbourne, we find that 50 per cent of the children who began their first year of secondary education were still enrolled in 1970 for their final year of secondary education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* So it can be seen that children who happen to be born in the Bendigo, Maldon and Castlemaine regions of Victoria have less than half the chance of continuing on to their final secondary year of education that the children born and educated in the central suburbs of Melbourne have.

* Looking at the new Commonwealth secondary scholarships scheme, the fact that for the first time since 1965 a means test has now been introduced into this scheme is in itself a condemnation of a consistent policy of discrimination in favour of the children from more affluent families. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* But it will not make a scrap of difference by bringing in a means test after a <span class="highlight">child</span> has sat for an examination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* It will not make a scrap of difference to the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the country school, the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the working class family, the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the migrant family and all those whom we regard as being in the low income section of the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21)

* It will not make a scrap of difference because the means test is applied through this scheme itself which has been convincingly proved over and over again to be discriminatory against a <span class="highlight">child</span> who happens to be born into a lower income family.

* One thing that caused me a bit of disappointment was that the Budget did not approve funds to assist the Isolated Childrens Parents Association, but as the Minister pointed out, by the Commonwealth Government's action in providing financial assistance for the States to undertake educational work, which has been their special responsibility down through the years, the States should be able to assist people in remote areas.

* I am hoping that as a result of the Commonwealth assistance to the States the States will be in a position to assist the Isolated Children's Parents Association so that parents in isolated areas will be able to provide for their children what is the birthright of every <span class="highlight">child</span>, a reasonable standard of education.

* Most importantly, they revealed that <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities had not kept pace with the rapid growth in the female labour force during the 1960s, and that, as a consequence, existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities were inadequate, qualitatively and quantitively, for the growing numbers of children needing them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Not only were there too few centres but in many cases the provision was only for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding and not for the quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care appropriate to the educational, emotional and developmental needs of the young children involved.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* These consultations revealed among other things, that <span class="highlight">child</span> care which was beneficial to the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s overall development was prohibitively costly for the large body of parents, and secondly, that the childminding arrangements that most parents could afford fell far short of the quality that was required in the interests of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* While many working mothers were able to make satisfactory arrangements for their children during working hours, a substantial number were not, partly because of a shortage of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and partly because of the cost.

* In summary, the Government decided that action was urgently needed; action to ensure sufficient good quality <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in the community for the proper care and development of pre-school aged children whose parents or guardians are unable, for a variety of reasons, to make other suitable arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* First, it is the view of authorities concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> care - for example the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Psychiatry Section of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists - that alternate care, provided for young children while their mothers are working, which is inadequate and unsatisfactory, can contribute to emotional disturbance in the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s later years.

* It is also a fact that at present 25 per cent of mothers with children under 6 years of age are in the labour force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The purpose of the scheme is to meet this existing problem - to help the children of working and other parents insofar as they are deprived of proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care either because good quality facilities are not available or because the cost is presently too high. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* In summary, the Bill provides for assistance to non-profit organisations, including local governing bodies, to establish and operate centres which provide day care for children of working and sick parents and which give priority of admission to children in special need. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The proposed scheme has 4 main elements, as follows: (i) capital grants; (ii) recurrent grants in respect of qualified staff; (iii) recurrent grants with respect to children in special need; and (iv) grants for research and evaluation of matters relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* In summary, unmatched capital grants will be provided and made payable direct to eligible organisations for: (i) the purchase, erection, extension or alteration of buildings, including necessary fixtures, and land cost, for use as a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre; and (ii) the purchase and installation of equipment for use in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres.

* The Government regards unmatched grants as the most effective method of ensuring that sufficient new <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres will be built where they are needed most, particularly in areas of greatest social need. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Provision in the Budget of funds for capital grants in this financial year should enable a substantial expansion of the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* It is hoped to establish some 50 new centres catering for some 3,000 <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the first full year of the scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* This would provide an increase of about 20 per cent in the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> care places available in Australia, lt is a significant first step, and the Government intends that at least this rate of growth will be sustained in subsequent years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* For its application for an unmatched capital grant to succeed, a claimant organisation will be required to demonstrate that it is capable of efficiently managing a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre, and that it can bear the responsibility of ensuring the centre's financial viability. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* In all cases, the acceptance of a capital grant will automatically involve responsibility for running the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre in accordance with the required conditions which I shall deal with later. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* After the first 20 children 3 years of age or over, the grant will be in respect of one qualified nurse for every 20 children or part thereof. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* There is provision for grants in respect of additional pre-school teachers in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres accommodating more than a prescribed number of children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Younger children under 3 years of age have other and more demanding needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The grant will be available for a qualified nurse employed in a centre for every 10 such children or part thereof for which the centre has enrolments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The number of children in this context refers to children enrolled for 8 hours during the day in a centre. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Bill includes provision for the calculation of the grant to be made in such a way as to take into account the varying hours that different children might attend centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Thus, under the scheme opportunities will exist for children aged between 3 and 5 years in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to receive pre-school education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Firstly, setting of standards for the employment of qualified persons in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is a function of State or local governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Bill provides for special recurrent grants to enable centres to offer reduced fees in respect of enrolled children from low income and other families in financial need. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* There have been suggestions from time to time thai attendance at <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be free. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The fees normally charged to parents of children not in financial need will bc of the order presently being charged in the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* For these fees, however, children will enjoy in government-assisted centres a quality of care superior to that otherwise available because of the nature of the facilities and the qualified staff provided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The basis of the method will be that an organisation operating a centre will receive payments with respect to children in special need. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* For this purpose, 'children in special need' is defined in the Bill - Clause 12 - as children of one parent families, of families in the first 3 years of settlement in Australia, of families where one of the parents is sick or incapacitated, and of families eligible to receive assistance under the subsidised health benefits scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The maximum rate per hour of attendance per <span class="highlight">child</span> that may be paid to an organisation will be prescribed by regulation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The circumstances of families placing children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres cannot be predicted in advance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* In a scheme of this nature, that relates to the development and care of children, every opportunity must be made to ensure that organisations assisted can operate their <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres with compassion and with the capacity to assist the most needy cases as they arise from time to time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* At the same time, it will be the responsibility of organisations operating centres to balance their own financial budgets, taking into account the recurrent grants that will be made available - both in respect of staffing and with respect to children in special need - the fees they can collect, and their other sources of income, if any, against their outgoings for salaries, maintenance of equipment and buildings and other current expenditure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* At present in Australia there are some 80 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres operated on a nonprofit basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* In respect of these grants the scheme will come into operation when the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act receives royal assent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care on such days and during such hours as the Minister determines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The intention of the first of these conditions is to ensure that preference in admission is given to those in greatest need of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Organisations Li receipt of grants will be required to operate the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres concerned for the benefit of the community in which they are located and generally to the satisfaction of the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* It will, of course, be obvious to honourable members that organisations seeking capital grants will have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Minister that a need for the new or additional <span class="highlight">child</span> day care facilities exists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Bill provides for a <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee to be established to advise the Minister on the range of facilities that will be covered by the unmatched capital grants to organisations, on the standard of these facilities and on the service provided in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in receipt of grant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* In considering appropriate facilities and their standard the committee will, of course, have regard to the standards for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres required by State legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The committee may also be asked to advise on other matters referred to it in connection with the <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* I hope that it will be possible to include officers of relevant State government departments who can advise on the facilities that should be provided, on the best approach to the development of children in centres, and as to the geographical areas that are in greatest need of additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Government intends to ensure that developments in its provision for <span class="highlight">child</span> care continue to have regard to the wide variety of views that are known to exist in the community on the subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* One practical application of this proposition will be studies to review how the scheme provided for in this legislation is meeting the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the family and the community, and to identify inadequacies, if any. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The second expression of the Government's concern about future developments is the provision for research to explore the very large field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, particularly as it relates to day care, and related areas such as after-school and holi-day care for school-aged children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Government is uncommitted as to the eventual directions in which its assistance towards <span class="highlight">child</span> day care nay develop. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* One area that will inevitably attract investigation is alternative forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care such as family day care centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Also worthy of study is the motivation for mothers of young children to continue to care for their own children in their own homes rather than to enter paid employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* For example, in this regard what is the persuasive influence of appropriate family counselling on mothers of young children? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Another area that will need development is the form by which the evaluation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care arrangements may proceed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* It may be possible to involve, say, professionally qualified social workers or sociologists experienced in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care field to work in and around the Government assisted <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Another important avenue for research relates to the training of staff for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* There is a view, for example, that new forms of training are required to meet the needs of children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The research would need to concern itself with whether such courses might range from professional to short part-time training arrangements applicable to <span class="highlight">child</span> care personnel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* lt is proposed that this committee be called the '<span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Research Committee'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The functions the Government envisages for this committee are to make recommendations regarding applications for grant; to evaluate the direction of the Government's <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme when requested and to advise accordingly; to recommend measures for the training of <span class="highlight">child</span> care personnel; to recommend areas for research and experimentation into important aspects of <span class="highlight">child</span> care; and to advise on the application of research findings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Children of pre school age should not be deprived of proper care and the opportunity for the fullest possible development because their parents are not looking after them at home during the day. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* It was confirmed again and again during the consultations which the committee of officers undertook during its examination of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care problem and to which I have already referred. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The attitude of the working mother is that her presence in the community is a fact and that assistance with the care of her children is a pressing need. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Its intention is to ensure that the development of its assistance for <span class="highlight">child</span> day care is kept under close review. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* It is not the Government's intention to help additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres into existence and then forget about them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* <span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres will be community oriented. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* It is basic, therefore, that the physical conditions in the centres facilitate and encourage the participation and involvement of parents in the care and development of their children at the centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* One responsibility of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee will be to examine designs for centres to ensure that they incorporate physical features which parents placing their children in a centre can use as a community service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* More precisely, parents will be encouraged to see the centre as a place to which they can come to discuss the development of their children with other parents, with the staff in the centre and with qualified professional people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Government envisages that if a beginning can be made to turn this legislation into reality quickly, we can look forward to an increase of at least 20 per cent per annum over the next 3 years in the number of places for pre-school children that will be available in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* This is worth achieving while research into related developments is being evaluated, lt is very important for honourable members to appreciate that significant though the increase in physical accommodation is, of much greater importance is the provision for improving the quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care that will be available to the community in future years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Under it a scheme is being provided for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres of good quality. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* The quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care is important not only to parents who, for one reason or another, choose to work, but also to all parents because in today's mobile society, with families living apart from grandparents and other relatives, there are many who have nowhere to turn when they are ill or in need of assistance with their children during the day. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* <span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres have to be seen in their proper perspective; they are supportive of the family unit and in extreme cases are the alternative to placing children in residential institutions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0)

* Because of the number of variables involved it is not possible to assign an upper limit to the cost to governments of transporting a particular <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0)

* In the latest year for which official information is available (1970-71) State governments spent $37m on providing transport services or over $13 for every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending government and non-government schools. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0)

* Costs in respect of individual children in rural areas are likely to considerably exceed the average cost. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0)

* In view of the Minister's decision to attempt to publicise the existence of the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan through posting out notices on the scheme with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment cheques, what measures have been planned to study the effectiveness of this move. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-19)

* The answer  to  the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) As indicated in the reply to question 5100 of 30th May 19.72, the posting of notices with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment chequeswas one of a number of measures designed to further publicise the Subsidised Health BenefitsPlan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-19)

* It was considered that most low-income -families receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would be contacted in this way, but the lodgment of applications is a matter for action by those families. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-19)

* It means that unemployed people in rural areas will receive between $50 and $60 a week on work subsidised by the Government while the unemployed in the city will receive the miserable unemployment benefit of $17 plus $8 for a wife and $4.50 for a <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0)

* The Department of Labour and National Service has been studying and promoting from time to time particular initiatives, such as the one relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, in regard to the female work force.

* One facet of this operation has been to make available Commonwealth funds for a development which will enable the children of working mothers to be reasonably looked after, probably to be productively and constructively looked after, while their mothers are at work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0)

* I think that in the terms of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and other things it is thoroughly within the province of the Minister - not my personal problem but the problem of the unemployment of women who are available for employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0)

* If, in fact, we are doing the sort of thing that was projected yesterday in this chamber in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, then clearly there are measures being taken to make it possible for women to make themselves available for various forms of work.

* They prepared a budget for a family of 5, comprising a husband, wife and 3 children on the minimum wage paid in Queensland - the lowest wage would be $46.80 - and this budget showed that at the end of the week, if they did not run into expenses, the family could have 50c left for luxuries.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-39-0)

* This Parliament has no right to be called upon to debate a Bill for an Act to deal with <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and at the same time have withheld from it vital, crucial information prepared by a special committee which would tell us whether the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  has introduced a Bill that coincides with the facts and whether the Bill introduced by the Minister is a Bill that should have been introduced, having regard to the findings of the inter-departmental committee.

* In my mind there is no reason why women who care for children at home should not, on occasions on which it can be justified - that would be on many occasions, I would imagine - leave the children in a properly staffed <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre so that they can do some shopping, visit an art gallery, go to the pictures or do any of the other things which many women, because they have to care for their children on a 24-hour basis, find it difficult to do.

* I believe that whilst this measure will be of great benefit at this time in our history I certainly would not like to see a decline in the family unit in Australia because I believe that the family unit, with devoted parents showing proper and true affection to the number of children that they want, is the richest asset any country can possess.

* Thus unborn children have been recognised as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, but the existence of these rights is contingent upon the <span class="highlight">child</span> being born alive; that is, these rights are retrospective rights.

* However, for the information of the House, in view of the great interest that there has been in this matter of dual citizenship, I think I should let the House and the honourable member know that article 4 of the Yugoslav Citizenship Law Act of 1964 provides for Yugoslav citizenship to be acquired by a <span class="highlight">child</span> on 3 bases: If both parents are Yugoslav citizens at the moment of the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s birth; if one parent at the moment of the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s birth is a Yugoslav citizen, and the <span class="highlight">child</span> is born in Yugoslavia; or if one parent at the moment of the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s birth is a Yugoslav citizen, the other parent without a citizenship, and the <span class="highlight">child</span> is born in a foreign country.

* As there is a changing emphasis, however, to the 3 and 4-year-olds its aim will continue to be to ensure that pre-school education to higher standards is available to all children in the wider age group of 3 to 5 years and, in addition, to be a leader in the field in Queensland in the area of full-day <span class="highlight">child</span> care.

* Secondly, will he accept my assurance - I am sure that I speak for all honourable members who, out of a strong conviction on the basic principles involved, voted against the Bill and the amendment - that the House will co-operate to the fullest possible extent in helping the Government expedite the development of measures such as family planning clinics, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and education programs which will make an important and constructive contribution to the solving of the serious personal problems which abortion raises for many people?

* The problem that the Association poses to the Minister - I will try to make this as brief as possible - is that in order to adopt a war orphan from Vietnam, a <span class="highlight">child</span> of varied race, which the members of the Association wish -o do, they have to apply for adoption by proxy through a Vietnamese lawyer once the children have been located for adoption purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34)

* They then go on to point out that the United States Government has an agreement with the Vietnamese Government whereby a release form is sent to Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">child</span> can then leave for its new home within 6 weeks of its being located, during Which time the legal adoption process is conducted and completed in Vietnam. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34)

* My information is that it costs $25 a month while the <span class="highlight">child</span> is being cared for in Vietnam, and that it takes sometimes 8 to 9 months to complete, the proxy adoption. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34)

* I want to reply to the honourable member very specifically on one point, namely, that the Department of Immigration of the Australian Government is advised in the basic principle relating to this matter by the various State Departments of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34)

* The biggest problem faced by these families, or at least the individuals, who wish to adopt the children, the dispossessed, the orphans of Vietnam is to validate the adoption through the State authorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34)

* In the first instance, these children must be adopted according to Vietnamese law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34)

* If the various State departments approve the adoption and when proper clearance has been secured  I  will give every support - I want to pledge my co-operation in this - to getting the <span class="highlight">child</span> united with its parents of adoption in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34)

* The remaining proposals in the Bill are a result of the introduction by the Commonwealth of schemes to assist with the education of children living in isolated areas and for the payment of a domiciliary nursing care benefit to persons taking care of invalid aged relations in their homes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0)

* Like the scholarship schemes, however, amounts payable for the maintenance or accommodation of isolated children are to be taken into account for the purposes of the concessional deductions for maintenance of dependants, while allowances paid in respect of education costs are to be taken into account in calculating the concessional deduction for a <span class="highlight">child</span>'s education expenses.

* No less than 85 per cent of the family homes to be built by State housing authorities with our advances will be allocated to families where the average gross weekly income of the main bread-winner - exclusive of any overtime and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments - does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as defined in the Agreement.

* In line with our policy of ensuring that our housing advances for welfare purposes benefit the more needy, applicants eligible to receive home builders' account advances will be families consisting of a married or engaged couple, or a single parent or guardian with one or more children, where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, inclusive of overtime but excluding <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, does not exceed about 93 per cent of average weekly earnings, plus $2 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> beyond the second. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0)

* We all realise that even though recommendations are known to be possible of implementation at a future time, sometimes the actual availability to the <span class="highlight">child</span> being educated at the school is dependent upon some money being available during the planning stages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0)

* It may be that in some of the areas the State authorities will themselves be prepared to commit their own money to ensure that the planning takes place so that 'the money available for 1974 can quicklly be converted into facilities available for the education of the children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0)

* But there are many areas in which, if money were immediately available, additional educational facilities could be provided for children in schools where there is now a considerable need for improvement of facilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0)

* For example, the Bill did not provide for, say, a 13-year-old <span class="highlight">child</span> who is pregnant to have reference to her parents before an abortion is carried out. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0)

* Even though, as a liberal, one could get oneself to the view that a woman has every right to do with her body as she pleases - that could be a liberal view - once one overcomes, if one can, the hurdle that a foetus has a right to life, I was finally persuaded by a report by  Dr and Mrs Wynn  who had some evidence that once a woman had had 3 or 4 abortions and then decided to have a <span class="highlight">child</span> the chances of that <span class="highlight">child</span> suffering some serious pre-natal or perinatal handicap were increased considerably. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0)

* As a liberal who cares for human beings, if this evidence is right and I do not know whether it is, I must be concerned that there is a possibility, where there is abortion on request or demand, of a <span class="highlight">child</span> being born seriously handicapped.

* The classes of women to whom the new benefit will be payable under this Bill are (a) unmarried mothers, including deserted de facto wives and de facto wives of prisoners; and (b) married women not living with their husbands (deserting wives) or wives who have been separated for various other reasons, provided that the women be living with, and have the custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> (or children) of whom they are the mothers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* These women are those who are not at present eligible for a widow's pension under the Social Services Act and who, with their children, have been subject to discrimination in the level of assistance available to them in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* The new benefit will become payable 6 months after the date of the event which gives rise to eligibility - for example, the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or separation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* Returning now to the Bill, the rate of supporting mother's benefit will be the same as the rate of class 'A' widow's pension, including mother's allowance, additional pension for children and, where applicable, supplementary assistance for those mothers who are paying rent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* Honourable members will recall that these rates in weekly amounts are: pensions, $21.50; mother's allowance, $4, or $6 if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 or an invalid; additional pension, $4.50 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>; and supplementary assistance, $4. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* The means test and other conditions for payment will be broadly the same as those applying to class 'A' widow pensioners; for example, the residence qualifications will be the same and it will also be a responsibility of the supporting mother to seek maintenance from the father of the <span class="highlight">child</span> if, in the circumstances of her case, it would be reasonable to expect her to do this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* I understand that in Tasmania a deserted de facto wife of 12 months' standing may sue for maintenance for herself and children, but in the other States she may claim maintenance for children only. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* A word about children: The Government believes that when a mother gives birth to a <span class="highlight">child</span> she should not be discriminated against merely because conception may have occurred after she became a widow or after she became separated from her husband. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* In future, both for widow's pension purposes and for supporting mother's benefit, a widow's own <span class="highlight">child</span> or a supporting mother's own <span class="highlight">child</span> will qualify them for the respective pension or benefit, irrespective or whether their <span class="highlight">child</span> was conceived before or after the date of widowhood, desertion or separation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* This Bill therefore amends the old definition of '<span class="highlight">child</span>' which has remained in the legislation since 1942 and introduces a new definition, which defines a '<span class="highlight">child</span>' as any <span class="highlight">child</span> born of the mother or a <span class="highlight">child</span> of whom she had the care prior to the date on which she became a widow or a supporting mother, including a <span class="highlight">child</span> who was an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> at that time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* A further advance made by the Bill is that the additional pension of $4.50 a week for children will be payable for all other children in the care of the widow or supporting mother, whether those other children are qualifying children or not. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* A deduction of $6 a week for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> will continue to be made from the widow's income and will also be made from the supporting mother's income before the means test is applied. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* This, in effect, gaves a class 'A' widow or supporting mother with one <span class="highlight">child</span> a permissible income of $26 a week plus a further $6 for each other <span class="highlight">child</span> dependent on her. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0)

* A <span class="highlight">child</span> will also be accepted as being in the custody, care and control of a widow or supporting mother where that <span class="highlight">child</span> is not living with the widow - for example, where it is living away from home to attend school, provided the widow is making a reasonable contribution towards the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s maintenance.

* This Bill amends the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act in 5 ways: It makes provision for special superannuation arrangements for New South Wales and South Australian teachers now teaching in Commonwealth schools; it provides benefits by way of book and equipment allowance to Commonwealth Teaching Service scholars; it provides benefits by way of special financial assistance for Commonwealth Teaching Service scholars; it repeals existing provisions for officers absent from duty in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> birth; and it enables the Commissioner to provide, and the authorities to use, members of the Commonwealth Teaching Service for special educational duties.

* We will find that by tackling in a piecemeal fashion the problems concerning the provision of benefits for children we will impose great pressures on the normal family in the community and that by putting those pressures on that family we will cause greater difficulties in the future because of the inability of the normal family to face the financial burdens that are imposed upon it when the first and second children come along and the mother chooses to stay at home and care for those children.

* I do not blame anybody for not solving it in the past, except that I believe social workers as a profession should have taken much more effective steps to bring about a reconciliation between the foster parents, the parents and the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and taken steps to make sure that what occurred in this case does not occur again.

* As has already been pointed out in this debate, there are a number of methods used in teaching children English and integrating them into the general educational program of the schools. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0)

* One method, of course, is the withdrawal method of taking the children away from the classes to a special English class, giving them special tuition and then returning them to their ordinary classes.

* As has already been pointed out by one of my colleagues, this has its problems because it withdraws the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the standard classroom curriculum in which he or she would otherwise be involved.

* I hope that given adequate lapse of time an assessment will be made of the relative advancement of the withdrawal of children into a migrant English class and their grouping together in one class where the whole normal education program is supplemented by the special English training. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0)

* In reply to a contribution made, I think, by the honourable member for Batman, I would express the hope that our own children at the pre-school level would be able to have the exposure to language and cultures that would broaden the base of our Australian culture at this time.

* Following a run of losses, if no relief is readily forthcoming - and it must be realised that a community's ability to help can reach saturation point - either services will have to be restricted or parents already labouring under great difficulties and personal distress at the condition of their children, will have to be charged fees.

* With the limited numbers enrolled at the Darwin adult education centre, 200 children were required to be looked after while their parents were attending classes and, with the greater numbers enrolled at the Community College, it surely will be necessary to take some steps, even if it is not in the original plan, to acquire a house in the near neighbourhood to be used as a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre so that these many students will be able to attend the college and not have to turn their backs on courses that otherwise they would have taken.

* We now are faced with the much more massive problem which goes right to the root of our social structure, namely, of help for the young and the forming family and, particularly, help for the young couple at the time of the birth of their first <span class="highlight">child</span> or in the provision of the matrimonial home which is desirable at all times but becomes, I believe, necessary when the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is born. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0)

* Will the new Minister consider the <span class="highlight">child</span> at school who by instinct tends to progress along with the group, and yet may have the ability if he used personal individual effort to learn faster than the others? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* We read a lot about malnutrition and how this is caused through lack of utilising the proper foods available and in the method of preparation, and in fact a lack of knowledge of the foods that are available to assist in rearing strong and healthy children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* The scheme that was introduced of allocating finance to a coloured family for every <span class="highlight">child</span> that attended a secondary school offset this to some extent, but I know that in some instances the <span class="highlight">child</span> only attends secondary school in order that the family gets the benefit of the finance, and not because of any desire to further his education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* And again their idea of group living does not lend itself to the <span class="highlight">child</span> making an individual effort, and he cannot be blamed for this, but this certainly is one matter which must be looked at when thinking in terms of education for our coloured children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* When there is an incidence of <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality that is 20 times higher than that for comparable European communities, there is a need to bring every possible health resource to bear on the problem - not just in the hospitals but in the treatment and provision of sewerage systems, water supplies and things of that kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I remember in an inquiry about the Alice Springs hospital people talking about the high mortality rate among Aboriginal infant children, and the Committee being given an account of a nurse going out into the area and finding an undernourished Aboriginal mother who would be given advice about taking her <span class="highlight">child</span> off breast feeding and putting it on to the bottle.

* When I brought in the isolated children's scheme the Western Australian Government went out of the isolated children's scheme and used the $810,000 it saved to make grants to nongovernment schools and to raise them to the $104 level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35)

* The New South Wales Government makes a grant to families of $88 per <span class="highlight">child</span> if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is going to a private secondary school if the parental income is below $7,000 a year - this is the grant that will commence under the new New South Wales Budgetbut it is of no advantage to the school. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35)

* The Karmel exercise, which no political party had ever anticipated, stated that a dignified standard of education for every <span class="highlight">child</span> is 40 per cent above the existing State school level, which would be $715 per pupil at 1973 values of the dollar.

* The honourable member will be aware that as far as <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants are concerned we are worried about the fact that the States have no classrooms for the children to be taken to and given special lessons in English, retiring from the normal classrooms.

* I turn to the needs of the handicapped children and particularly those who are psychologically disturbed and have specific learning difficulties or have difficulties of language expression and articulation; that is, to children who, under any proper system of priorities for educational expenditure, would receive prompt and proper care from the phychology and guidance branches of education departments, from the speech therapy branches of education departments and from remedial teaching staff of education departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0)

* A report presented recently to the Victorian Minister for Educa tion revealed that in that State, with a school population of 600,000 children, a mere 98 officers in the Psychology and Guidance Branch were available, 43 of whom were still in the process of training.

* I wonder whether the honourable member for Wannon and those who, like him, try to undermine the process by which these facts could regularly be brought under public scrutiny have any comprehension of the misery of the family and the <span class="highlight">child</span> when defects of speech get steadily worse over a number of years while that <span class="highlight">child</span> is waiting for treatment and none can be provided for him.

* It reminded me strongly of speeches that I heard from members who are now in government, over a period of years when they pleaded with the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the then Minister for Education and Science, to take account of what was happening in schools across Australia, other than those elite and fortunate schools from which he sprang and to which he, and his colleagues, customarily send their children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0)

* There was a good deal of the resonance of that honourable gentleman's attitude in the speech that was made a little earlier this evening by your colleague,  Mr Lucock,  the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  who expressed great satisfaction with the approach to education of the previous Government when he said that every <span class="highlight">child</span> was treated the same way and that that made the system relatively easy and simple to administer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0)

* If the index of resources devoted to the education of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school is expressed as 100 units, children who attend Catholic parochial schools and Catholic systemic schools have devoted to their education 70 units, and the resource allocation for children at non-government, non-Catholic systemic schools ranges from 40 units to 270 units. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0)

* If the Government is prepared to spend $800 a year on the secondary education of one Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, every other Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> should be entitled to the same amount of expenditure by the same Government, and he should be entitled to it as a right, irrespective of the school he attends.

* If one is going to talk about who is getting the benefit in education I draw the attention of the honourable gentlemen opposite to these facts: Twenty-eight per cent of state school children complete a secondary education and can go on to a tertiary education; 35 per cent of children at Catholic schools complete a secondary education and can go on to a tertiary education; 86.5 per cent of children in non-Catholic non-government schools complete a secondary education and can go on to a tertiary education.

* If a <span class="highlight">child</span> attends the non-government non-Catholic sector of education - which normally is the high fee charging sector - and he goes on to tertiary education he will get a subvention from the taxpayer which leaves the ordinary <span class="highlight">child</span> in the ordinary state school for dead.

* In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Education I must say that it is surprising to me that the Government has departed from the practice of making per capita grants to assist independent schools in providing education for the children in that system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* There can be little doubt that wherever independent schools are providing a standard of education comparable to that of state schools there is a saving for the Australian taxpayer to the extent that those schools receive less financial assistance than the cost of educating children in state schools. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* The saving may be even greater now than it was in the past when the cost of educating children in primary schools was $308 per annum per <span class="highlight">child</span> and secondary schools received $520 per annum per <span class="highlight">child</span>.

* Anyone who is claiming the maximum taxation deduction for education of $600 and who is sending his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a school where fees are around $800 or $900 a year is paying in excess of 50c in the $1 taxation - probably about 60c in the $1 - and about $400 of this $800 is returned to him as a taxation deduction; not only that but also 80 per cent of the students at those schools were receiving Commonwealth scholarships under the previous Government so that it meant the parents were again getting an increment from the Commonwealth by way of those scholarships; and not only that but also 90 per cent of the students of these schools went on to university and it was costing the Commonwealth Government of Australia about $5,000 per head per student for every year that they were at university.

* They got the best that the Commonwealth was able to offer and for that they have used, cajoled and badgered and had every one in the establishment, including those bishops of the Catholic Church who were on-side, come in and back them to prop up a rotten, iniquitous per capita grants system that denied a <span class="highlight">child</span> in an electorate such as the one I represent, at a school with a pupil-teacher ratio of about 50 to one the opportunity of obtaining a reasonable standard of education and access to tertiary education later.

* While this legislation does make provision for assistance to be given to disadvantaged schools - the special schools looking after handicapped children in the traditional sense of the use of the word 'handicapped', which does not include children with SPELD problems - there is doubt about whether it is the Government's intention to include children ..with special learning difficulties under the general definition of 'handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>' and 'special school' in which case they are being lumped in with all other handicapped children.

* A deep point of philosophy and even pragmatism is involved here because it can be well and truly argued that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> for different philosophical reasons should be higher than for, say, the second <span class="highlight">child</span> because quite often the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is far more costly to the family unit than the second <span class="highlight">child</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* What he said was that an interim committee would be formed ultimately to establish the Commission which will take over responsibility for administering all existing commitments in the areas of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-schools, and will immediately set to work to enable a substantial beginning to be made on the new program no later than January 1975.

* This worthy group of people that is endeavouring to open a <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility in January of next year has found that it is almost impossible for a church working in the area with limited facilities to be able to gather together the funds necessary for it to commence operations from the completed centre.

* As Reverend J.

* I believe there is no way that a committee or a commission not directly responsible to this Parliament can act fast enough when matters are referred to it for report in this way, and bring about a situation where the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre in Telopea and the many others that are seeking to be operational next year will be able to function and be functioning to meet these urgent needs that are evident to us all.

* They occur in his electorate as they do in my electorate and in many other electorates across the country where expanding urban populations and increasing numbers of working mothers are creating the demand for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres.

* When the allocation of funds for faculties such as <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is determined by Government departments under direct ministerial control, the complaint of the Opposition is always that political patronage is being exercised and will become the basis on which facilities are made available.

* In other words, we have made sure that the allocation of funds for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and pre-school centres will be determined on an expert and impartial basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* The foreshadowed establishment of the Children's Commission, the appointment of the interim committee for this Commission, and the initiation of the national pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services program is a momentous step forward in the social history of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* Honorable members will be aware that no fewer than 365,000 Australian children under 6 years of age have mothers who are engaged full time in the work force and that there are places available in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres at present for no more than 34,500 of those children.

* While it is most difficult to obtain precise pre-school education statistics for Australia as a whole, it seems certain that the position is still one in which there is a pre-school place available for fewer than one in every four of the children whose parents would wish to take advantage of it if it were there. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* It is the aim of the Government to see within half a dozen years that there is a place in a pre-school centre free of charge for every <span class="highlight">child</span> whose parents want to take advantage of it and that there is a place in a <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility of one kind or another available for every <span class="highlight">child</span> whose parents want to take advantage of it, at a charge related to income - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* I am always a little surprised to hear members such as the honourable member for Parramatta complain that undertakings such as the <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility to which he referred a few moments ago will be delayed when, under the government in which the party that he supports last participated, the prospects of such an organisation being financed at all would have been very remote indeed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* Government moved in the matter of pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care at all and that, indeed, it was only in the last year of office of the former Liberal-Country Party Administration that a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program was launched. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* While we recognise on the one hand that there is an enormous number of mothers in this community who are obliged to go out to work by economic circumstances and who have a pressing need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, equally there is an enormous number of women in the community who would simply welcome an occasional break away from their families. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* That is why we are emphasising the provision not only of full time day care centres but also of occasional day care centres, of play groups organised on a voluntary basis under expert guidance and supervision, and a variety of other forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> care.

* Furthermore, I would suggest that we use the term '<span class="highlight">child</span> care' to apply as it generally has and traditionally does to long term, long-day <span class="highlight">child</span> care, where parents may leave their children at a centre from early in the morning until reasonably late in the evening, certainly for 5 days a week.

* That is one of the criticisms of one of the first reports, because it had mainly as its significance the establishment of buildings, land and training and there was not a great deal in the way of results from the point of view of <span class="highlight">child</span> care for the need that now exists.

* I will indeed, because under legislation introduced by the former Government and which the present Government is enactingand such legislation indeed applies to the Australian Capital Territory- there are 3 criteria which determine the eligibility for assistance under the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* The first is that the centre applying for' assistance has to give preference to children in need. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* The second criterion that has to be met is that the centre must be open to all children and not merely children of any particular category such as employees of a factory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

* It was a disgraceful performance by the Special Minister of State to try to allege that the program of <span class="highlight">child</span> care was other than on the lines I have just outlined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-29)

* I do not know why the Government is resisting our move because it is bad enough for a <span class="highlight">child</span> to lose a father, it is bad enough to have the breadwinner leave the family, but when the <span class="highlight">child</span> is deprived of the mother surely the area of need is as great as or even greater than is the case in the other circumstances.

* When the claim form is received by the Department it will be referred to an Australian Government Medical Officer who will examine the <span class="highlight">child</span> and certify whether or not in his opinion the <span class="highlight">child</span> is handicapped to a degree that qualifies for the payment of the allownace [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* One would think that it would be doubtful whether an autistic or hyperactive <span class="highlight">child</span> would be considered 'sick' enough to qualify for an invalid pension at the age of 16 years.

* The Bill also seeks to extend the Mother's allowance and the additional pension for children to Class B widows who have the custody, care and control of any <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* For example, has the Minister considered the proposition raised in the joint Opposition Parties policy document entitled 'The Way Ahead' that the maternity allowance for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> should be doubled to $60? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* But they go ahead budgeting, and if a <span class="highlight">child</span> arrives whether planned or not, that first <span class="highlight">child</span> imposes a massive burden. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Minister, instead of smirking or smiling, should note that action in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has been recommended by the Henderson Committee and by all responsible social welfare organisations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Henderson Committee has indicated that a great number of low income earners on the breadline with a wife and several children to support and who are suddenly sacked can experience deep hardship in the week following their sacking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* The honourable member gets terribly upset when we refer to the past, and I do not blame him for that, because he was a member of a government which for 23 years did absolutely nothing about the maternity allowance, about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first and second children which had not been adjusted since the previous Labor Government was in office in the 1 940s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* In Victoria, for State wards cared for by foster parents this Government has provided an orphan pension of $10 which is in the nature of a <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment type payment to those people to assist with the care of orphans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* We have the Victorian Premier reaching his hand into the pockets of these children and stealing the $10 like a thief in the night and his colleagues in other States are doing exactly the same thing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* One other area in which it seems to me that action should be taken is the area of assisting widows with children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* It does not appear to me that sufficient cognisance is taken of the very high expenses involved in children attending high school. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* When a person depends on a pension of any kind, the <span class="highlight">child</span> is very severely disadvantaged, even though educational and other benefits may be provided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* This is a social welfare area and some serious examination should be undertaken of the means by which such children can be placed on the same basis as other children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* For example, let me take the raising of the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s allowance from $5 to $5.50. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* So even with this new 50c, the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s allowance in terms of purchasing power will be far below what it was when we were in office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* I was interested to hear, I think it was the honourable member for Corio, talking about family endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Labor Party in its policy would have given nothing and it fought us tooth and nail when we proposed to endow the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* I am sure that the allowance which, as honourable members will be aware, is $10 a week to the parents of guardians of physically or mentally handicapped children who are cared for in the family environment, will meet with wide approval. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* I think the estimate was made that there could be 20,000 handicapped children in Australia who would qualify for this allowance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* Even though we do not welcome the fact that there are this number of handicapped children, I think one of the side benefits of this allowance will be to bring many of the handicapped children in the community more out into the open and let the Government know about them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* Apart from the general advantage of the benefit is the side advantage of a means of registration of handicapped children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* Perhaps it is necessary- because there has been a lot of worry by parents of handicapped children about just what will be the eligibility requirement for this allowance- to emphasise that attendance by the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at a day school or day training centre will not affect the eligibility for payment of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>'s allowance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* The main basis of assessing eligibility will be that the <span class="highlight">child</span>'s handicap is such that constant care and attention are necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* The payment is designed to assist parents who have to provide constant care for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years, at which age he or she might be expected to qualify for an invalid pension. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* The administrative procedures for dealing with claims for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>'s allowance have not been finalised in every detail, but I think for the benefit of those who are concerned about whether they might be eligible it would be worth while putting on record a broad indication of the policy pattern that it is intended to adopt.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* An important thing that I think indicates the Government's general attitude is that where a claim is rejected on the ground that the severity of the disability is not sufficient to qualify the <span class="highlight">child</span> for the payment of the allowance, the claimant will be advised of this and also advised at the same time that an appeal against the decision may be lodged.

* I have no doubt, however, that a fair amount of modification will have to be made because if this allowance is to fulfil its purpose of keeping handicapped children at home in the care of their parents, who must have the full capability of giving the proper care, not only the children, but also the families of the children will have to be assisted.

* Somewhere along the line we will have to try to assess not only the handicap of the <span class="highlight">child</span>- this is the starting point- but also the disability of the family, the alteration that a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> makes to their way of life and the conduct of their household, and the effect it has not only on the mother and the father but also on the other children in the family.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0)

* As I have said already, it is important that under a new scheme the guilty are not advantaged at the expense of the innocent, that the drunken middle-aged driver is not advantaged at the expense of the innocent <span class="highlight">child</span> whom he maims for life.

* But quite clearly the reason there have been no such longitudinal studies in Australia is that no funds have been provided for the purpose and largely because the community, knowing its attitude, has felt that it would be a gross intrusion on the rights of the person to inquire into what has happened to the ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> as it has grown older.

* Since the passing of that Act, Bills have been introduced by the Tasmanian, South Australian and Victorian Governments along basically similar lines incorporating in each case a schedule which amends existing legislation to remove the word 'illegitimate' where it occurs and to ensure that an ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> is not excluded by way of definition from participating in benefits and entitlements that should be available to him or to her.

* Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>,  because obviously she has had a lot of complaints from pensioners that they have not received the increase in pension, has resorted to the paltry, mean, untrue device of saying: 'Well, the Bills have been passed by the Houses of Parliament but the reason you have not got your increases, dear pensioners, is that the Liberal and Country Party senators went home early'.

* During recent years much public attention has been focused on the need for more effective policies relating to the care and education of the preschool <span class="highlight">child</span>, but those who have been most vocal have more often than not had a special interest in only a single aspect of the total problem.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* Much legislation discriminates against the normal 2-parent family and, in addition, places 2 -income families in an advantaged position when compared with those families where the wife and mother stays at home to care for her children.

* Organisations which have developed a distinctive style in the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities or education for the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> should not, through the imposition of strings, be required to conform to a standard method of providing care or pre-school education, provided of course that the services offered though diverse in character meet acceptable minimum standards.

* It is a measure that has met with public acclaim and, despite efforts by opponents of the Government to suppress the knowledge of the benefits to be gained, those concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> care and those in public life have been able to spread the message widely.

* -Despite its imperfections, this Bill which seeks to establish a Children's Commission is a genuine attempt to overcome one of the major social problems arising from a technologically advanced consumer society which claims a high standard of living, therefore requiring a large percentage of its work force, both male and female, to participate fully in the production of the goods and services required by the community.

* In 1968-69 the available <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in Australia catered for approximately 14 000 children only- not a very high figure- and in New South Wales, my own State, in 1972, the most recent figures available, there were some 760 registered <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres coping for 39 913 children up to 5 years of age. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* The estimated number of 3 and 4-year-old children in New South Wales in 1972 was over 165 000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* Despite these factors married women comprise only 22 per cent of the total work force at present and 70.8 per cent of those are of <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing age, which I take to be between 15 and 44 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* Thus the majority of women in the <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing category still remain at home and receive little assistance in bringing up young children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* One of the major difficulties which Australia has faced is that for too long the need to build up a pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care infrastructure, especially at the local government level, was not given the amount of attention which perhaps it should have.

* In view of the realities of the situation which have been emphasised, namely, that at present the existing facilities are simply not adequate to meet the existing demand, much less the anticipated demand in future years, I think the legislation is unduly short-sighted in not at this stage encouraging appropriately qualified people to enter the preschool and <span class="highlight">child</span> care area so that there will be adequate facilities to take those children whose parents wish them to be looked after.

* On 19 February 1973-just 79 days after we had been elected- the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  announced the establishment of the Australian Pre-Schools Commission to investigate pre-schooling and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres throughout Australia.

* Thus, on 19 September 1974, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister, the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  announced the Government's wish to establish a children's commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* The sad fact is that up till now preschooling originally intended by us as an important aid in removing or modifying inequalities of background, environment, family income and family nationality- had primarily benefited children whose mothers could afford to stay at home. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* As speakers in this debate have been asked to shorten their speaking time I shall conclude my remarks by saying that this Bill should go some way towards recognising the aspirations of the community for its children and its future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* Amongst other things -  lower the admission age to the year in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> turns five. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* It was also alleged by certain people who criticised him that he was reducing the funds available for other pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* Why he was suprised by this criticism is difficult to imagine becuase I am sure that to the casual observer it would have been clear that the State Government was trying to honour a clumsy election promise to lower the age of primary school admission, and to do this it was using Australian Government funds which in every other State were being used for the legitimate purpose of expanding pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* To the extent that a large program of construction of pre-primary centres would limit the possibility for the expenditure on other <span class="highlight">child</span> care services, the criticism of the Western Australian Minister for Educaton was quite valid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* Very simply, the amendments provided for a reconstituted Pre-School Board of Western Australia and empowered it to provide both educational and <span class="highlight">child</span> care faculties for children who were over 2 years of age and who had not yet turned five. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* This allowed the Board legitimately to obtain funds from the Children's Commission for the provision of early childhood services for children under 5, which has been the stated aim of the Special Minister of State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* I should say that the reason this situation has come about is that even though the Australian Government, through the Interim Committee for a Children's Commission did fund the preprimary centres last year the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  on a recent visit to Western Australia, indicated quite clearly that in future the Children's Commission would not fund the pre-primary program of the Western Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* Secondly, if the Australian Government commits itself to funding a preprimary program it will leave itself very little opportunity for expanding <span class="highlight">child</span> care and other services which it intends to provide throughout the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* It is true that the people of Western Australia are in great need of all the other sorts of services which it is intended will be provided by the Children's Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* I refer to the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State in which he indicated that some of the other services which would be provided would include full day care, family day care, pre-school education of course, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, play groups and other <span class="highlight">child</span> care activities in accordance with demand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0)

* The report went on to state that 437 000 people who were responsible for the care of children between 4 years of age and 1 1 years of age made no arrangements for the care of those children after school hours.

* Some years ago <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment- which was free spending money- for 2 children was worth an addition of 7 per cent to average weekly earnings which were coming into a home.

* For 4 children in the early 1950s it was worth an additional 15 per cent of average weekly earnings and today it is worth an additional 5 per cent or 6 per cent of average weekly earnings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* Furthermore, I am concerned that this transfer of significant authority becomes evident in the definitions of 'services for children' contained in the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* In the definitions of the services for children, which are the linchpin of this legislation, 7 types of services for children are listed and in many of them the final words are that they are to be available for children who are not being cared for in their own homes, for children whose parents are engaged in employment, for children who whether are sick or physically disabled, or for children where assistance is needed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* After all, I believe that all children in Australia need assistance and any public authority caring for them must be interested in them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* It is not enough for a government to say that, with the birth of every <span class="highlight">child</span> a family can be driven into pauperism and then to say that that family, having been driven into pauperism by the government's taxation policy, will have services made available to it outside the home under conditions that the government determines.

* What I have said does not mean that I subscribe to the view that the Children's Commission is to be seen as a body concerned solely with education unless one takes the term 'education' in its broadest sense of meaning the total development of the personality of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* The intent of the Government in creating a Children's Commission is to provide an imaginative and comprehensive range of services so that not just one group of children, not just the children of working mothers, but all children will have access to those services best designed to promote their wellbeing and to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of their parents.

* Everybody in this House supports the view that a great deal needs to be done in providing proper care for children in that there are many children in Australia, particularly where both parents are working or the sole parent is working, who are not getting adequate assistance at the moment and that the community does have a responsibility to provide assistance to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* However, it could also be said that that is about where the consensus on the <span class="highlight">child</span> care issue finishes because there are strong differences of opinion within the community on the whole philosophy of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and this really centres on the role of women either as mothers or as members of the work force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* One view is that as women have rights equal to men as members of the work force, their childbearing role should not be allowed to prevent them from finding work, job advancement or job satisfaction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* The result of this is the belief that the community should provide and pay for the care of children while their mothers work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* It means that we have not really solved the problems of <span class="highlight">child</span> care by the mere act of providing for a Children's Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* The money outlaid on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and the distribution of that money is of tremendous social importance because it represents redistribution of income. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* Returning to the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care being paid for by the Government- that is, if the Government pays for the care of children of working parents- that amounts to a redistribution of income away from single income families towards 2-income families.

* What I am saying is that the Government must ensure that it is aware of the social and economic consequences of all the decisions of the Children's Commission before financial support is given to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* If <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, for example, are paid for by the community what we are doing is taxing everybody to pay for the children of the 2-income family to be looked after.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* It becomes clear from the terms of this Bill and the definition of services for children that in some respects this Bill and the present <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act will operate in much the same area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* I am concerned at the more rigid formulas that have been adopted in relation to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act which may have led to a situation in which those centres which are being funded under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act may not be in a position to receive the same benefits that are now being made available to institutions that will be established and funded by the Children's Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* I should like to have clarified for the purposes of many organisations funded under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act the extent of any deprivation that the existing and funded institutions and facilities may suffer, and whether they can achieve or receive benefits similar to those that will be made available to those newer organisations which will subsequently be funded under the provisions contained in clause 3 subparagraph (a) dealing with services for children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* I refer particularly to a submission which I showed to the Minister and which the Minister received, as did other members, from a number of organisations that established <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* The organisations include the St Paul's Lutheran <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre, the Ardill Family Centre, the Church of Christ <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre at Mt Druitt, the Greystanes <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre and the Telopea Church of Christ <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* The submission mentions the salaries subsidy and states that in relation to the experience that these centres have had in the period of operation- a fairly short period of operation, as it is- it is evident that the fees having to be charged by the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are excessive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* It seems quite unfair that <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centres which are basically designed and built to meet the needs of people in working class communities should have to charge more than twice the amount being paid by pre-school centres in predominantly middle class areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* This is because the salary subsidies paid to <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centres are most inadequate, for example, at Telopea, out of a staff of seven (2 trained teachers, 1 nurse, 3 assistants, 1 cook) employed at the Centre only one trained teacher and the nurse are being subsidised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* This seems to me to require some clarification of the way in which those centres under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972 are to be dealt with in relation to the more generous funding that seems to have been established by the Interim Commission.

* The submission mentions the problem of a number of children in a family in which there is only a mother and no father at home, and deals with the problem that that mother has in paying for <span class="highlight">child</span> care in this institution out of the pension and other benefits that she receives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* Originally these centres were not meant to meet the needs of a person like this, but because of the large number of mothers who were formerly in the work force and who are now unemployed, it has been found that centres which would otherwise have been full, and were planned on the basis that they would be full, have to take in other children to remain economic and viable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* The centre in Telopea is concerned to meet the needs of the surrounding community and those for whom there is this special need rather than take in the children of parents who are able to afford to send the children to that centre.

* I make no criticism of the previous Government for its intention to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres under that Act, but we have to be critical of the standards and of the general concept of finance that is involved.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* Does not the honourable member realise, as a sensible man, that the construction of all these centres is motivated by the fact that there is parent involvement and that the children are better off by having somebody interested in them? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* I say this to the honourable member for Lilley: He should not engage in the hypocrisy of drawing a line and stating that some children will not receive any attention or assistance simply because a parent is at home. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* It would then mean that each year and at other times the Minister would be required to come to the Parliament with State grants legislation which would detail the programs that were to be funded on the recommendation of the Children's Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* If one looks at the report of the Priorities Review Staff on early childhood services, one can see the deep involvement of the States in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school education programs- programs which they directly run and administer and those which they support. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* I am sure that when the Minister replies he will draw attention once again to the remarks that he made in his second reading speech in which he pointed out that the Opposition parties, when in Government, funded schemes for the provision of finance under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act by direct grants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0)

* Even if we did in that pilot arrangement, limited in its scope, fund it by direct grants pursuant to section 81, we now believe that because of the experience gained in the administration of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act, whereby the need for a more comprehensive program has been made manifest, in those circumstances the funding should be direct to the States through section 96 grants thereby involving the States and their administrations in the more comprehensive expansion of facilities available in the pre-school care and education area.

* I fear that there may be a possibility of the catalyst making a recommendation to a commissioner, despite what comes from the advisory boards, and then that commissioner carrying on those views with perhaps personal views to the commission, and funding taking place without any proper consideration of the priorities set by the State or indeed by people involved in <span class="highlight">child</span> care.

* I preface my question by reminding him that he said in this House this week that adopted children who received Medibank cards in the name given by their natural mother and not their present name did so because of neglect to advise the Department of Social Security of the correct name.

* Although one cannot but notice the Minister's heavy concentration on <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs- almost to the exclusion of any reference to pre-school education as has been pointed out in the debates both in this House and in the Senate- the Opposition sees the care of the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> in a comprehensive way.

* We urged that, by the mechanism of section 96 which ensures that the States would be involved in the process of the funding ofthe programs, a better integration would be achieved between those programs proposed by the Interim Committee and, in the future, by the Children's Commission itself, than would be the case if the Commonwealth simply funded programs direct and did not involve the States in the way that they would necessarily be involved by the application of grants under section 96 of the Constitution.

* The full-year cost of taxation rebates for dependent children and students, had they been indexed in 1976-77, together with the cost of the present <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme, would have amounted to about $ 1,025m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0)

* Since the Government proposes in its first Budget to make pensions paid to all persons below age pension age subject to taxation, why are not the greatly increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments also subject to tax? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0)

* So far as the major point of the honourable gentleman's question is concerned, that is to say the family allowances and the major increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, if I may say so,  Mr Speaker,  that is one of the most significant measures of social welfare introduced in this country by any government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0)

* I believe that it will greatly assist families, particularly those in the poorer financial brackets, and as I think I said in the statement, it will directly have a very advantageous impact upon the 300 000 poor families with some 800 000 children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0)

* Caution with the money supply, personal tax indexation and increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment might well be part of that package, but so too would be the continuation and expansion of the effective expenditure programs begun by the Labor Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* Fifthly, Labor welcomes the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* However, my sixth point is that we deplore the fact that these improvements to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment have been carried out at the expense of so many. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* The Government is also providing an increase- a large increase- in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which will be paid to the mothers of children in areas in which there is real need and in which the private welfare agencies have said that such payment is so necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* I turn to the third element, namely, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* Any person who has a regard for children and a love of family will desire to ensure that the mother will have a better opportunity to feed, clothe, entertain and ensure the recreation of her children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* I believe that we achieve more than that, because under the present provisions, particularly with regard to the indexation of wages and income tax supplementary to an increase in wages and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increases, we have established the proper basis on which we can now approach the trade union movement in order to ensure that the unions are persuaded to come to the party and agree to an incomes policy and, more particularly, a responsible wages policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* At the point of implementation of the package, that is, when tax indexation is introduced and we have the Medibank levy and the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and dependent children's tax rebate manoeuvre, a lot of people will be worse off. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* The increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the abolition of the tax rebates for children mean that families will have less cash in their pay envelopes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* The positive sides of it in fiscal terms are the change to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, tax indexation- which is one of the most important changes ever introduced in Australia- and, of course, a transfer from the rebate system to a cash transfer system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* First of all, the statement on the one hand makes substantial improvements in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and on the other hand it takes away the tax rebate system for children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0)

* First of all I want to take the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment versus tax indexation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0)

* We are told that the combined cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment plus the tax rebate system is of the order of $ 1,021m of which something like $240m, or about one-quarter, is attributable to the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment bill and something like three-quarters of the total cost is attributable to the tax rebate system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0)

* It is now proposed that we should introduce a <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment system that will have approximately the same total cost but will distribute the overall benefits somewhat differently. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0)

* I simply make the point rather categorically that from now on the difference between married and single taxpayers as far as the tax system is concerned is no longer contained within the tax schedule but is contained within the payments for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0)

* All I suggest is that not enough credit has been given or attention paid- and I think this is implicit enough in the kind of explanation that was given in the Treasurer's speech- to what was done recently by the tax rebate system that was supposed to operate, and will operate certainly for the year ended June 1976, but will be terminated with respect to children as from 1 July 1976. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0)

* I would have thought that the logical step would have been not only to remove deductions for children from the tax schedules but also to have removed deductions for wives from the tax schedules and put some kind of cash benefit upon what a wife is supposed to be worth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0)

* I have another question to ask: Given that the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment costs approximately the same as the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment plus the rebate, what will be the effect on 1 July when the tax deductions no longer apply for children? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* For instance, the proposal to move tax rebates for children into <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is desirable, but with qualifications, as I will mention a little later, because the net benefit is much less than the benefit was made to appear when the statement was made to the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* The <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment proposals- moving the tax rebate for children across to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowmentI believe constitute a very good principle. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* The Government does not want to index the rebates for children which existed under the tax scheme and accordingly is moving them across to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* I refer to such things as the cancellation of the rebate for dependants and its replacement with a family allowance or increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments; the disbanding of Medibank and the forced return of people to the private health insurance funds, with a slug to taxpayers to pay for it; and income tax indexation as a trade-off to the Medibank tax or the Medibank levy- call it what you will, because it is one and the same thing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* Why did the Government decide to take away the rebate for dependent children and turn it into a family allowance or an increase in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* The Government will save about $l,025m with the elimination of the rebate for dependants, and the cost of the new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments is the same amount, $ 1,025m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* <span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment payments are paid into the banks, and I think it is true to say that many mothers will leave the money there as a nest egg, call it what you will. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* A Government document released, or leaked, a couple of days ago indicates that 57 per cent of taxpayers will be worse off as a result of the 3 changes announced by the Treasurer, that is <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, Medibank and tax indexation.

* Not only that, but the proposals for Medibank, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and others form a policy for the redistribution of wealth which in itself is not an economic policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* The change from <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to family allowances, together with the abolition of the tax rebates for dependent children, will bring very great benefits to low income families.

* However, the basic change now to be made with the introduction of family allowances at a much higher rate than the previous <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will prove to be of major assistance to many of these low income farm families about which I have spoken.

* Between May 1972 and May 1976 the standard rate of pension increased by 126 per cent, but by contrast the additional allowance for children of pensioners increased by only 66 per cent and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, which remained stationary in nominal terms, declined steeply in real value because of the rate of inflation experienced in Australia over the last few years.

* It was not only that the poor did not benefit; the rich, who benefited most from the money they received from the tax concessions for their children, used what to them was a small and marginally insignificant <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payment either to swell their children's bank accounts or to purchase luxury items for them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* Although <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is not means tested, the impact of the combined measures- that is, the increases in endowment payments and the abolition of tax rebates for children- has a similar effect to that of a means test and quite properly will ensure that resources will be directed away from the relatively well off families and into the hands of the poorer families in Australia.

* Some members of the public in Western Australia have questioned the wisdom of a government providing subsidies to those who wish to have children; some have suggested that it is a penalty against those who do not have children; some have said that it provides a positive incentive to have more children; and the most distasteful criticism of all comes from those who say that it gives encouragement to those irresponsible people who have many children but cannot afford them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* To those who suggest that it is wrong for the Government to subsidise those who have children and to penalise those who do not, I simply say that in the aggregate there has not been any significant increase in government resources directed to helping families who have children, whether these resources be measured in the form of direct expenditure via <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments or in the form of a loss to revenue through tax rebates.

* To those who put forward these criticisms, I say that their argument means that to deny these poor people assistance is like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted and the children would suffer the consequences if adequate government assistance were not available to compensate them for their parents' amorous activities.

* These new measures will help to ensure that this is the case, whereas the previous levels of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in an indirect way more or less suggested that only the relatively well off could benefit from Government assistance, principally through the tax rebate system, if they had children.

* The money that is to be paid in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to a substantial number of families but not all families will be more than offset by the losses of expendable income in areas in which people have greater reserves and are more likely to spend that income. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* It also should be pointed out that 58 per cent of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments are currently paid directly into bank accounts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* But I suggest that the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments in those areas in which the family can possibly afford it- if the family could not it would be spending its total income anyhow- will remain in the bank to meet especially those commitments to rates and the commitments of that nature that will of necessity increase because the Government has not in this package indicated a sufficient level of support to local government to prevent very substantial increases in costs in that area being passed on to the public this year in the form of municipal rate increases.

* In comparing the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments with the tax rebates it was stated that the present rebate is $3.85 a week or $200 a year per <span class="highlight">child</span> and the difference was calculated on that basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* However, because of the Government's decision to index taxation and to index deductions- for example, for a dependent wife and some other dependants- it is obvious that the indexed rebate for a <span class="highlight">child</span> next year would have been $226, not $200. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* Therefore, the difference should have been calculated on an extra $26, which would raise the present endowment by 50c a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* So, although the tax tables published show that people will be 7c or 14c better off, I do not think that is terribly important; nonetheless, for every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the family people will really be 5c a week worse off than was shown in the published figures.

* The first point I raise is that when tables were published giving comparisons of the whole effect of the package, a comparison was made on the basis of a rebate of $200 for student children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29)

* In other words, it is silly to compare the endowment figure with a notional rebate of $3.85 a week per <span class="highlight">child</span> which the taxpayer now loses- $200 a year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0)

* 
 His second point related to the effect that the abolition of tax rebates for children and their replacement with increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments would have on a man who is paying maintenance to his wife or former wife in respect of children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0)

* As the honourable member correctly pointed out, the husband or former husband will lose any income tax rebates that he would previously have been allowed in respect of his contribution towards the maintenance of the children, while his wife or former wife will receive the benefit of the increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0)

* It was not considered practicable, or appropriate, to provide special treatment in the income tax law for persons in the situation described by the honourable member who considers that there will be a significant unfair transfer of extra <span class="highlight">child</span> maintenance from the father to the mother who is looking after the children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0)

* The more appropriate course in these circumstances would appear to be for the father to confer with the mother to see whether some reasonable accommodation to the new situation is not practicable and, if there is a court order for the maintenance of the children, to seek variation of the order on an agreed basis.

* Throw in the Medibank neutralising effect on any benefits from <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax indexation, and you find that the leaked Treasury document is probably understating the situation when it says that over half of the work force will be worse off as a result of the Government's deal.

* The Minister, in association with <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities, is concerned to do whatever is possible within her powers to facilitate the adoption of the many children such as these and in fact already has signed some 90 orders which have the effect, by exempting the children from the provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, and hence the guardianship of the Minister, of permitting the due legal processes in the States or Territories to determine whether adoption applications may be approved.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0)

* Although there were very great problems involved in her attending a state school, including problems of transportation and the like, and certainly problems in relating to other children and problems in hearing lessons and so on, on balance it was felt by the parents and people who were advising them that this was a beneficial thing for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to do.

* The proposed means test of $1 10.60 per week, which is the level of the minimum weekly wage, plus the allowance of $6 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> would naturally have the effect of excluding a very large number of families who at present receive the benefit.

* The facts are that the people in the community with families receiving the family benefit today are worse off in real terms than they were at the end of 1975 when they received <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the tax rebate for children which I introduced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0)

* That is why I am able to point out- the facts confirm it- that today the average income earner or, as the Prime Minister likes to call him in that new matey parlance he has suddenly discovered, the average bloke supporting a wife and two children is, before tax but after consideration is taken of the present family allowance compared with tax rebates for children and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in effect at the end of 1975, $8.50 a week worse off.

* In Committee we will be proposing amendments which will broaden the scope of proposed section 7a  (  1 ) which protects the interests of children, require a response by the Government or those so delegated to a passport application in reasonable time, reduce the severity of most of the proposed penalties, and provide a right of appeal against a decision to withhold or withdraw a passport. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* The purpose of this section is to ensure that the unmarried minor is not issued a passport without steps having been taken to protect the rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the rights of persons who have custody or guardianship of or access to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* It is not clear how the passports office will ensure that it is in possession of the facts in relation to custody, guardianship or access for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* Moreover, the withholding of consent by a person having custody, guardianship or, more particularly, access may not, of course, be in the interests of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and the Act provides that a court may order that a <span class="highlight">child</span> may leave Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* Our proposed section 7a (2) (c) then proceeds, however, to give the authorised passports officer discretion- a discretion parallel to that of the Court- to allow a <span class="highlight">child</span> to obtain a passport and travel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* It may be that the Bill could be interpreted to cover this situation, but given the extent of specification in the Bill it would seem best to make explicit reference to the inclusion of children on a passport, and apply the same rules.

* The resume of that particular example indicates the sorts of problems that are faced by parents in a separated situation who do have the legal custody of their children when that <span class="highlight">child</span> or those children are abducted by the other parent and removed from the country.

* On 22 February 1978, the honourable member for Hawker asked a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  whether an interdepartmental committee had been appointed to examine and to report on the issue of passports with particular reference to <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* However, I believe that it is necessary to retain that requirement for the practical means of protecting not only the financial rights of a spouse or former spouse but also to guard against this situation of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction and removal from the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* That particular part of clause 8 is directed towards the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> abductions but it will not eliminate the problem of the removal of children from Australia since it can be by-passed by dual nationals who hold two passports, by the use of false documents, by making false statements, and by making application outside Australia for a passport. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* After studying this proposal the Government has come to the view that this would not prevent the unauthorised removal of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* Individual passports would also raise the possibility of the <span class="highlight">child</span> taking the passport and leaving the country without the knowledge of either parent or being removed by another unauthorised person. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* The proposed requirement for parental consent to the Issue of a passport to children who have not obtained the age of 18 years, which is embodied in the legislation, therefore provides the opportunity, so far as the legislation can practically go, to cope with this problem. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* During the passport review by the interdepartmental committee, to which I referred earlier, it became clear that the problems of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction went beyond the simple matters of passport issues and a further interdepartmental committee has therefore been established to investigate all aspects of this specific problem, including the procedures which other departments and authorities could follow to prevent <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* Certainly I believe that Cabinet legislative or administrative changes are necessary to reduce the incidence of children being removed from Australia by one parent without the knowledge or against the wishes of the other parent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* The ultimate solution to the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction for separated or divorced couples is to ensure that separations or divorces do not occur. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0)

* The Government, through its policies, has a responsibility to ensure that maximum support is given to the family and thus minimise the likelihood of marital breakdown with its subsequent problems, of which <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction is one manifestation.

* -Whilst I support the Passports Amendment Bill and will press our amendments to it, the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  will acknowledge my persistent efforts to eliminate the high incidence of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction within and from Australia, and the need for urgent legislative and administrative changes to reduce it.

* The Government has said that this year <span class="highlight">child</span> care funding is to be increased by 1.03 per cent, but what it has not told the public at large is that in that increase it has lumped the cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in the Northern Territory.

* Unfortunately when one looks at the level of expenditure and inflation, which the Government itself says will be at least 10 per cent in the coming 12 months, it can be seen that the amount of money being made available for children's services in Australia has been reduced in real terms by 2.4 per cent.

* The family allowance scheme is now very much like the scheme which was introduced in 1950 when another conservative government came to power on a promise to pay <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>- an appeal to greed rather than need.

* The situation of a woman who has a <span class="highlight">child</span> not covered by a war widows pension because it is not a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the deceased exserviceman whose offspring attract a pension, is that if she applies to the Department of Social Security for coverage of that <span class="highlight">child</span>, the war widows pension is applied as a means test against her in assessing whether the childrens allowance will be paid in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span>.
