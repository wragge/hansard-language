* All we have is statements about <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the life of the Australian Parliament - that must have as much relevance to the progress of Papua New Guinea as has the life of the Norwegian Parliament - and statements earlier in the year by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be reached some time in 1974.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* The first area is the role of the Regiment which operates in Papua New Guinea and which was initially entirely under Australian control and command but which has a progression through the ranks of indigenous Papuans and New Guineans and which until <span class="highlight">independence</span> will still remain the responsibility of the Government of this country.

* I hope that these deficiences will be recognised by the Government of Papua New Guinea and that there will be an insurance that, in the development of educational facilities in this about to be independent country, there will not be the ill consequences that seem to have befallen so many other countries moving into <span class="highlight">independence</span>.

* One hopes that it is possible that there be maintained a very strong fraternal relationship in the evolution of foreign policy which, passing as it will from the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Government of Papua New Guinea, can still involve a measure of consultation which will ensure that Australia can assist Papua New Guinea in the formulation of the new relationships which one hopes can lead to the achievement of the objectives about which I have just spoken.

* The ethnic divisions that exist in Papua New Guinea, the problems of communication, the divisions that are unfortunately apparent between the people of Papua and those of New Guinea and the concern that many people in several areas of Papua New Guinea feel about the move into <span class="highlight">independence</span> are problems that today will and henceforth be the responsibility of the Government of Papua New Guinea.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I conclude by pointing out to the honourable member for Kooyong that it would not be possible for one to make any statement in the House on what are very important matters for the Papua New Guinea Government, particularly in relation to defence and our aid program for defence to Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> which, as I have said, will continue, until these discussions with the responsible Ministers in Papua New Guinea have been concluded.

* The Prime Minister's announcement only a week or so ago that the Government has undertaken to provide for Papua New Guinea, which is about to become independent, a sum of approximately $A500m over the next 3 years indicates one of the ways by which bilateral aid can give to a country - in this instance one so close to Australia - a feeling of economic confidence which I am sure was material in Papua New Guinea being able to set a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span>.

* It seems to me to be totally wrong both to deny the constitutional provisions of this country and to seek to act unilaterally, to find that you are bashing your head against a brick wall because the State Government of Queensland is vested with the right of an exercise of power in this area and to do little or nothing about this matter so soon before <span class="highlight">independence</span>.

* The discussion of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Executive and Parliament may suggest that these are the only threats to judicial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and that public confidence can be maintained where the judiciary engages in political activity or public comment as long as the activity is seen to be a sign of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the government of the day.

* Not only has the Government reneged on its promises with regard to the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty, but it has also, I believe, been less than frank in its policy in relation to another major input of the sugar industry in determining its predictability and its <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the vagaries of the weather^ I refer to the Bundaberg irrigation scheme.

* It is heartening to see that the present Government at least has come to realise the contribution that natural gas can make to Australia's energy <span class="highlight">independence</span> and also the importance of having a well-planned gas grid connecting the major demand and supply centres of Australia.
