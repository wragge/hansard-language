* Weaken respect for marriage, regard it as easily and opportunistically dissolvable, remove the lawful backing for the mutuality of obligations and promote the <span class="highlight">independence</span> or separateness of the parties to the marriage and their children and I believe that we are threatening the institution of the family and its stabilising influence in our society.

* We realise that this must place in question the commencing date of the Government's national health scheme, but we can understand the attitude of the health funds because to have accepted the agency requirements of the Government would have been to place at risk the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the health funds and the way in which they have functioned as bodies for voluntary contributions and benefits which have been developed from time to time.

* But it should be said that these Bills are being treated with a contumely both by the House of Representatives and by the Senate which belies the importance which they have to the future of Papua New Guinea and does little to acknowledge the contribution which Australia has made towards the development of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in that Territory.

* I indicate that the Opposition supports these Bills because they must be supported, and we do it willingly, but I indicate also that there are gaps in what should be Australia's attitude to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and the laughter of the Government senators I think is a fair commentary on their general attitude.
