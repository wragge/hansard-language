[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

* South Australia's Tripartite Industrial <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Committeecomprised of leading employer, union and Government representatives- maintains that joint consultation, the delegation of responsibilities and employee involvement in the decision-making process will solve many problems because dissatisfied employees are given the opportunity to reduce the sources of dissatisfaction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0)

* Consequently, I believe it is relevant to say that it is on the determination and capacity of people to collect information, sift it and analyse it, that the future of this free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as of any free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> around the world, is largely dependent.

* The second basic facet to a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> revolves around equality of opportunity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* The third facet of a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- the Australian system- relates to the profit motive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* The point I make is that if our sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to survive we must recognise that freedom itself is a somewhat meaningless word unless it is freedom within a measure of discipline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* I mention those few basic yardsticks of a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not because they are the only ones, but because I think it is worth while and proper that we should consider the system which we have developed and which has developed us.

* In other words, it would regard, as I think  Senator Puplick  put most eloquently, rights as being an inherent attribute of being fortunate to the resident within the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that State boundaries and State jurisdictions and the accident of birth and the accident of residence should play no part in the question of whether an Australian resident is entitled to vindication in an impartial court of his rights.
