## Contexts in which the word **protesters** was used in the Senate during the 1970s

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0)

* As I said last night-4 will not walk away from anything I have said - I do not think that anybody has a right to be a nuisance or to deface property, but the reason why there are <span class="highlight">protesters</span> today is the legislation that the Government is a party to.

* I suppose the most noticeable are the anti-war <span class="highlight">protesters</span>, who, basically, are against war because they understand the stupidity and the futility of war. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0)

* The anti-war <span class="highlight">protesters</span> and the anti-conscription <span class="highlight">protesters</span> are those groups of youths which have woken up to many of the things about which I have spoken.

* They feel that being against an anti-war movement or against the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> satisfies their need for something to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0)

* According to my own observations of protests these <span class="highlight">protesters</span> generally do not do anything personal against the representatives; it is against their country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43)

* If the Aboriginal embassy is erected again, or if there is any similar protest on the lawns in front of Parliament House, any politician who goes across the road to support the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> - and politicians have thought that it is their duty to do so - will be in breach of this Ordinance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0)

* The second matter that arises from this question- I take this opportunity to make this perfectly clear to honourable senators- is that there has been in existence since 1937 an Ordinance of the ACT forbidding groups of more than 20 <span class="highlight">protesters</span> to assemble inside an area 100 yards from the physical walls of Parliament House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-1)

* At a time when  Mr Dunstan  is presenting himself as the champion of anti-uranium <span class="highlight">protesters</span> and the champion of Aboriginal interests, the revelation that uranium drilling is taking place in Aboriginal historic and sacred areas must dismay Aboriginals throughout Australia.
