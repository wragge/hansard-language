* But I think I would be performing a useful- and factual - service if 1 were briefly to outline certain aspects of the health benefits plan as they apply to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, to those receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits, and to migrant settlers for medical or hospital expenses incurred during the first 2 months in Australia.

* 2550 which was supplied to the honourable member for Bendigo shows that this figure of 11,000 can be quite grievously misleading, lt represents double counting, because when one looks at the breakup of membership of health insurance organisations for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> one finds that it is a total figure covering people registered, in the first place, for medical insurance and, in the second place, for hospital insurance.

* So what in fact has happened is that the Government has lumped a little over 5,000 together twice and said that this is 11,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>, but in fact this is double counting and it is fairly obvious that the <span class="highlight">families</span> drawing on low income medical insurance are the same <span class="highlight">families</span> appearing under hospital insurance claims, and similarly for the other groups - the migrant groups and the unemployment and sickness beneficiaries.

* The proposals announced in the Budget Speech to provide for the allowance of deductions for self-education expenses, the increase in the minimum taxable income and in dependants allowances, and the reduction in the rates of personal income tax, which will average 10 per cent per annum, will provide substantial reductions in the total income tax payable by all persons, but especially those with <span class="highlight">families</span>.

* The Minister has made a great deal of an argument, without providing facts, that 3 out of 4 Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>" would pay less under his system, but that is to say that they would pay less for what he is offering, which is standard ward treatment in a public hospital and, perhaps, in a private hospital.

* In view of the sorts of deprivation that are evident in the more deprived <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community, we believe that the $12m spent on the scheme last year, which would increase every year, is far better spent on the sorts of benefits that have been brought forward under our social security policy to help low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and to enable them to choose their priorities for nutrition.

* Despite the school milk scheme and despite all the other schemes which have been adopted on an across the board basis, we believe that the proper way to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> that are nutritionally in trouble is through the Australian Assistance Plan which will discriminate in favour of those <span class="highlight">families</span> that need help and give them the sort of help they need.

* Too many members of the work force of this country, unfortunately for the honourable member, are now appreciating the absolute folly of wage increases which to them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> have become illusory as the process of inflation induced by the honourable member and his colleagues has continued unchecked in recent years.

* In this context it is of great significance, in relation to the Government's decision to use the vehicle of family allowance to direct resources away from the relatively well off to the poor, that the report showed quite clearly that the group of people in the community whose incomes fall below the poverty line by the biggest percentage were in large <span class="highlight">families</span> whose fathers were earning the minimum wage or a little more. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* Indeed, one of the most disturbing aspects of the situation was that there were a quarter of a million dependent children in very poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, many of them in 2 -parent <span class="highlight">families</span> with the father in full employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* The Government has recognised that the previous system of taxation rebates for dependent children benefited those in the high tax brackets and did little for the really poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly those who did not pay any income tax at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* I have always felt that this was an abuse of scarce government resources, particularly when there were many poor <span class="highlight">families</span> who needed much more in the way of family allowances to provide better food, clothing and other basic or essential items for their children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* Although child endowment is not means tested, the impact of the combined measures- that is, the increases in endowment payments and the abolition of tax rebates for children- has a similar effect to that of a means test and quite properly will ensure that resources will be directed away from the relatively well off <span class="highlight">families</span> and into the hands of the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* Conversely, because of this redistribution, if wealthier <span class="highlight">families</span> wish to purchase less essential and more luxury items for their children, obviously more of this kind of expenditure will have to come from their own resources and less from the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* A further advantage of the new system is that <span class="highlight">families</span> will not have to wait until the end of the financial year to receive the benefits of family allowances, as occurred under the tax rebate system.

* To those who suggest that it is wrong for the Government to subsidise those who have children and to penalise those who do not, I simply say that in the aggregate there has not been any significant increase in government resources directed to helping <span class="highlight">families</span> who have children, whether these resources be measured in the form of direct expenditure via child endowment payments or in the form of a loss to revenue through tax rebates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0)

* The other criticisms I have heard- I repeat them- are that this scheme is an incentive to have more children and that in particular it gives encouragement to certain irresponsible people who have large <span class="highlight">families</span> but cannot afford them.

* The money that is to be paid in child endowment to a substantial number of <span class="highlight">families</span> but not all <span class="highlight">families</span> will be more than offset by the losses of expendable income in areas in which people have greater reserves and are more likely to spend that income.

* Instead of withdrawing provisions which certainly were not generous when compared with those operating in other countries, the Government should be facilitating the establishment of maternity and paternity leave provisions in the private sector; providing adequate child care facilities instead of reversing advances made by the Labor Government in this area; exploring ways of providing adequate permanent part-time work for government employees with young <span class="highlight">families</span>, and encouraging the private sector to follow suit; and, finally, investigating the effects of making provision for easier re-entry or retention of career rights for women who stay out of the work force longer to look after children.

* Our tax and social security systems must not be used only to safeguard individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> against unpredictable and catastrophic loss of income or to enable the chronically disadvantaged to maintain a decent standard of living; they must also be used to assist individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> to redistribute their lifetime income from the peaks of relative affluence to those periods of relative poverty which are today putting <span class="highlight">families</span> under so much stress.

* For example, single-income <span class="highlight">families</span> with incomes under $16,608 pay $707 a year or $13.60 a week more in tax than twoincome <span class="highlight">families</span> with the same family income.

* In phasing in reform, we should have two aims: Firstly to reform the tax scales in such a way that no taxpayer pays more tax on the same money income that he does under the present tax scales, and secondly to reduce progressively the proportion of income paid by single-income <span class="highlight">families</span> by way of tax until it matches the proportion which is now paid by two-income <span class="highlight">families</span> with the same household income. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0)

* At current inflation rates, indexation on the optional family tax scale without interruption since the last adjustment would mean that, within three years, the amount of taxfree income available to all <span class="highlight">families</span> would be unaffected by the proportions in which the spouses earn the family income.

* The fact that the unemployed receive their benefits through the post has eliminated the dole queue, but it has not eliminated the anguish and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of decent Australians who simply want a job, or the plight of those thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> whose breadwinners are unemployed, who live below the poverty line and whose suffering prompted a significant and important statement by the Catholic bishops of Australia.

* Bearing in mind that proportionate to immigrants' representations in the community, there are many more immigrants or children of immigrants who are unemployed and untrained than there are other members of the community, ordinary Australians, in a sense this cut will hit immigrants and their <span class="highlight">families</span> more than the rest of the Australian community.
