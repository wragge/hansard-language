## Contexts in which the word **individualism** was used in the Senate during the 1970s

* I am quite certain that they would have learned that the ultimate goals of our system - the pursuit of profit, <span class="highlight">individualism</span>, glorification of the millionaire and the inquisitive person - do not suit their background and history.

* Bjelke-Petersen in terms of <span class="highlight">individualism</span> and the rights of the individual in terms of new developments in government, he should say so so that everybody in this chamber and everybody listening know where he really stands.

* In my opinion, the Government does not express the real Australian character which has always been one of rugged <span class="highlight">individualism</span> and self-reliance but with proper concern for a fair go for everyone.

* The third and fourth aspects of the Speech are important- the question of the development of <span class="highlight">individualism</span> and giving back to people the right to make their own decision and also the development of Federalism in a healthy state instead of what it has suffered recently.

* Until society is reformed so as to give real opportunity to such people, any reference to the beneficiaries of reform programs as 'unwelcome dependants on the state' is callously insulting, and talk of '<span class="highlight">individualism</span> and initiative' remains the self-indulgence of the elite.

* I think you have your own quaint form of <span class="highlight">individualism</span> which would be quite inappropriate really to the Soviet system, but I do think that the idea on trade practices which you have is a system that is controlled and ensures that there are no cut prices at all- a system which ensures that those people who want to buy things will pay the high price for poor quality which is so much a part of the Soviet system.

* I believe it is important to recognise in any discussion of the wool industry the degree to which it has traditionally stood on its own feet- the degree to which initiative and <span class="highlight">individualism</span> have been typical of it.
