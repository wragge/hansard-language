* I want to observe very quickly that in the first place this programme was designed not to encourage <span class="highlight">women</span> to enter the work force but to deal with an immediate problem which now exists and which, as I understand it, is of such dimensions that a quarter of a million children under  6  years of age have mothers who are currently in the work force.

* For that reason, the Repatriation Commission is examining the repatriation system, lt is important that the Government and the taxpayers should continue to appreciate that the ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen who served the country so well in time of danger and threat to our existence are entitled to retain a special place in the community.

* Because of the 26-year period since the last major involvement of Australia in war - that is, in a numerical sense - and because of our relative security at the moment there- is a, perhaps understandable, tendency for people to attach less importance than they have previously to the debt we undoubtedly owe to the members of our fighting forces - men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, past and present.

* According to the terms of a statement issued in Melbourne by the honourable gentleman he was not dealt with in similar terms to the 5 <span class="highlight">women</span> and because of the absence of similar treatment, to use his words, there was cynicism in the application of the law.

* I am informed by senior officers of my Department that the situation depicted by the honourable member for Lalor is a distortion and a misrepresentation of the facts because his misadventure at the office of the Department of Labour and National Service in Melbourne on Monday was very different from those of the 5 <span class="highlight">women</span> concerned.

* As a result of the imprisonment of those <span class="highlight">women</span> for 14 days for a trivial, insignificant offence, as far as I could discover - and nothing that the Minister has said today in any way contradicts that - I decided that from the point of view of civil rights and civil liberties this was going too far.

* I think it is a very poor thing that at a time when these proceedings are being broadcast all over Australia a responsible Minister in a national government is willing to say things that were never given in evidence in court against those <span class="highlight">women</span> and which were never suggested to me yesterday by officers of his own Department when I asked what complaints they had about these <span class="highlight">women</span>.

* Nothing that the Minister has said has suggested that there has not been discrimination in this matter, when 5 <span class="highlight">women</span> whom somebody thought they could intimidate along with a lot of others were imprisoned for 14 days for the purpose of intimidating them and when, for some special reason or other - whether it be political or some kind of view that one can go too far - no action was taken against me.

* In respect of other inquiries I have made, I find that the only time when any of these <span class="highlight">women</span> were on the floor is when they were being dragged out or lifted out of the Department of Labour and National Service into the hallway where they could be arrested legally.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0)

* There is no doubt about that even though sometimes, I must admit, as one who supported the abolition of sales tax and so forth, that I was somewhat depressed by reasonably intelligent <span class="highlight">women</span> arguing the way the previous Government had argued, namely, that many people in the community who became pregnant were unable to take the pill because of the cost I do not accept that argument.

* The estimate of the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who might use oral contraceptives if they were listed as benefits is based on a total population of <span class="highlight">women</span>, 18 years to 45 years of age, at 31st December 1970 of 2,346,614. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0)

* It has been assumed that 50 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the 18 to 45 years age group who do not at present use oral contraceptives would use them if they were free and that those at present using them would continue to use them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0)

* The argument is that there were, according to the previous Government, about 815,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> who were unable to use oral contraceptives even though they wanted to use them, because they did not have the money for them.

* In fact, when I asked the then Minister in a follow up question the basis of the reasoned estimate, as he described it, given in an earlier answer which enabled him to say that an additional 824,000 Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> would use oral contraceptives if they were available free as pharmaceutical benefits, the then Minister replied: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0)

* The estimate was based on an assessment of information provided ... by the pharmaceutical industry on the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> using oral contraceptives, statistics on the population of females . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0)

* So the previous Government calculated the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who would use oral contraceptives, if they were included in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, on the same basis as it might calculate if aspirin or any other sort of tablet were included on the list Obviously it is a ridiculous method of calculating.

* I think it would be a most unfortunate day for this Parliament if we ever passed legislation which put a thrust into the law to break down the traditional role that <span class="highlight">women</span> have played in our community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* I would be the first to concede that perhaps in years past there has been an undue bias in that direction and what ideally speaking we ought to achieve is a situation where, with proper regard to the interests of children, <span class="highlight">women</span> are in a position to exercise a choice as to whether they should fulfil a full-time wife and mother role or only a parttime one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* The proposition that is inherent in the amendmentI think it needs to be recognised- is that in the process of redressing the balance we might have gone a bit too far and we may be effectively closing off, not only in this legislation but in other legislation that affects the relationship in marriage between men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, the option of the full time wife and mother role. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* In fact I think that the amendment may in reality as a principle tend to downgrade the status of <span class="highlight">women</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* The reason I wish to speak to the amendment is specifically this: The presumption throughout this legislation has been the equality of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> to enter divorce and therefore to have exactly the same basis on which their marriages should be terminated, the fact of the matter is that a vast number of marriages up to the present time have been based on decisions made on social mores which were the accepted views of the community as early as 50 or 60 years ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* Many <span class="highlight">women</span> who entered into marriage contracts in earlier times did so on the specific presumption that their husbands would take care of them and be the sole or main source of their maintenance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* In  other words, a vast number of marriages do not in fact give <span class="highlight">women</span> the basis of equality that is presumed in this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* I notice it in speaking to married <span class="highlight">women</span> who stop at home. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* There is this extraordinary avant-garde attitude that if a <span class="highlight">women</span> is divorced and finds herself with a new status the forces of equality take over and she should be considered on all fours with the former partner of the marriage.

* In the brave new world in which we live and in which <span class="highlight">women</span> are, in their estimation, being elevated quite frequently to a position of equality, and the right to go out to work is not a choice but a necessity, we find that it is now being said to them: 'You are equal- equal in the right to pay your bills and equal in the right to go to work'.

* When I became involved in the great political party which has made such a contribution to the development of Australia over the years- the Australian Labor Party- I was reared on the credo, on the thought and on the belief that what we were trying to do for <span class="highlight">women</span> was to take them out of industry- take them from the mines and from the workshops- and give them a position of dignity in their own home in which they could care for their children, be greatly respected and preside over the moulding of the character and human quality of our people and the building of our nation.

* I want the Committee to remember that of the widows pensions that the Government pays over half are paid not to de jure widows but to notional widows- that is, to separated and divorced <span class="highlight">women</span>- it is the availability of this pension which makes this amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Fraser)  so much desired, because what is happening is that only a small subvention from the husband or the ex-husband will be capable of keeping a woman in domestic circumstances rather than sending her out to work, as the pension will be available also.

* I rather hope that the majority of members of this Parliament are prepared to vote in favour of this amendment to ensure, if in fact there is some doubt about it, as I believe there is, the rights and the protection of <span class="highlight">women</span> under this new Family Law Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24)

* Coming as it does from one who, quite honestly, has a very tender regard for the position of <span class="highlight">women</span>- I say this quite solemnly and seriously; I know that he does- I can only say that he is misguided if he believes that the proposed new clause ought to be put into the Bill.

* Many of us can think back to the experience of sevicemen who returned to tertiary education after the Second World War and can recall how infinitely greater was the advantage that those men and <span class="highlight">women</span> took of their university places at the more mature age at which they were able to take them up.

* One of the diplomats answered the questions very courteously by saying that more <span class="highlight">women</span> worked in the Soviet Union that probably in any other country in the world, the reason being that when they were at war as our allies against the tyranny of Nazi Fascism, so many of their men were in the fighting forces that it was necessary for the <span class="highlight">women</span> to do the men's jobs.

* <span class="highlight">women</span> workers are treated like guests, lured from the kitchen stove into the economy during war and boom times, only to be cast off again when peace returns or the economy falters, as today.

* The need for refuges is increasing, along with the need for rape crisis centres and <span class="highlight">women</span>'s health centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* The other thing to which the honourable member for Robertson referred was the transfer of the office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Affairs from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to my Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* The Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Affairs was being placed in a department where it could have access to the Minister and could start to do things positively. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* It also is involved in an important project which is assisted very much by the report on human relationships, and that is the development of laws relating to rape and the protection of <span class="highlight">women</span> in relation to sexual assaults in the Australian Capital Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* Another thing that the Office has organised is the establishment of the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Advisory Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* The purpose of that body is to give <span class="highlight">women</span> a voice in government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* It is all right for honourable members on either side of the chamber to talk about the role of <span class="highlight">women</span>, but <span class="highlight">women</span> do not have much voice in government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* At least this Government has a Cabinet Minister who is a woman, but the voice of <span class="highlight">women</span> is not often heard in government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* So, the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Advisory Council will do exactly, precisely, what has not been done in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* Under the chairmanship of  Mrs Beryl  Beaurepaire and with the assistance of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have been chosen from right across the political spectrum in this country, I believe that the cause of <span class="highlight">women</span> will be furthered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* One thing of note that will happen in Canberra this week is that a shopfront office will be established in the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Affairs in the CML Building in Civic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* If the honourable member for Kennedy wishes to know something about <span class="highlight">women</span>'s affairs- I am sure that he could learn a lot- he can go to the CML Building, visit the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Affairs and find out something about the Government's policies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* The other purpose of that office is to enable <span class="highlight">women</span> to come in off the street, as it were, and seek information about where <span class="highlight">women</span> can be aided in government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* Honourable members opposite guffaw when I say that, but <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community do not have the opportunity to go to places or offices where there is a concentration on matters relating to <span class="highlight">women</span> 's affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* In a sense this is an experiment, but in another sense it is a real project by the Government to enable a form of access to information to be obtained by <span class="highlight">women</span> throughout the nation and <span class="highlight">women</span> who live in the national capital. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* If it is a successful experiment I hope that in future years the Government will see fit to set up similar offices around this country, I hope in co-ordination with State governments, so that there will be places to which <span class="highlight">women</span> can go to have some of the questions that affect them answered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* If those 1.3 million married <span class="highlight">women</span> were taken out of the work force it would not solve anything. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37)

* People such as the honourable member for Hindmarsh- I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  would back me up- apparently believe that married <span class="highlight">women</span> should stay at home.

* One direction, issued in 1948 and reaffirmed in 1973- those dates ought to be significant to honourable members on the other side of the chamber- prohibits the granting of assistance to a person who served during the 1939-45 War in the Citizen Military Forces or the wartime <span class="highlight">women</span>'s Services unless that person served outside Australia.

* Lurking somewhere, I am inclined to think, in the Government ranks or indeed in the bureaucracy- although I must say that the bureaucrats who administer the defence service homes legislation are a very modern group of people- is somebody who has the sneaking idea that some servicemen or servicewomen who may not comply with all the technicalities possibly could qualify for a loan at 3% per cent interest.

* By abolishing paternity leave the Government does nothing to assist the new relationships that young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are working out. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0)

* This fact was brought to light by statistics provided in 1977 by the Australian Government Joint Council following a survey of <span class="highlight">women</span> returning to work after maternity leave. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0)

* In regard to the criticism that only- I emphasise the word 'only'- 50 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> return to work after maternity leave, the fact is that a return rate of 50 per cent is much higher than might be expected from the normal work force participation pattern of <span class="highlight">women</span> responsible for children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0)

* Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that only 30 per cent of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> who are responsible for children aged 0 to five years in fact work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0)

* Thus it would seem that provision for a woman to return to her previous job at the same salary and seniority level, with accrued entitlements, for example long service leave and superannuation, has given some <span class="highlight">women</span> a choice of returning to the paid work force or not. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0)

* The aim of such leave is not to force back into the work force those <span class="highlight">women</span> who want, and can afford, to stay at home to care for young children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0)

* It is also likely that many <span class="highlight">women</span> are prevented from returning to work because of inadequate child care facilities, lack of part-time work, restriction of the period of unpaid leave, or a combination of those factors.

* Instead of withdrawing provisions which certainly were not generous when compared with those operating in other countries, the Government should be facilitating the establishment of maternity and paternity leave provisions in the private sector; providing adequate child care facilities instead of reversing advances made by the Labor Government in this area; exploring ways of providing adequate permanent part-time work for government employees with young families, and encouraging the private sector to follow suit; and, finally, investigating the effects of making provision for easier re-entry or retention of career rights for <span class="highlight">women</span> who stay out of the work force longer to look after children.

* I inform the House that after the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who is at the table, made some comments last June or July foreshadowing changes in the maternity leave provisions, I received five phone calls from both men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who were concerned about those provisions, either because they were men married to female public servants or, alternatively, being <span class="highlight">women</span>, because they were planning families.

* After years of devoted study of abortion law versus choice morality, Callahan found it necessary, reluctantly, to choose permissive abortion as the only type of abortion law which recognises <span class="highlight">women</span>'s rights over their own bodies, but not absolute rights because due regard must be given to the foetus and to society, and which upholds the dignity of the law by not allowing it to fall into disrepute, as laws prohibiting abortion do.

* If we as a community believe that our society would be a better and more humane society with fewer abortions, and regardless of how we as individuals vote on the motion before us today, we must as a community take increased steps to lessen the number of situations arising where abortions are contemplated by the <span class="highlight">women</span> concerned.

* The alternative is a supporting mothers' allowance, a guardians' allowance, a dependants' allowance, a family allowance and supplementary assistance for accommodation because most of the <span class="highlight">women</span> receiving the supporting mothers' allowance draw on that benefit- a total cost over 16 years in current terms of $61,000.
