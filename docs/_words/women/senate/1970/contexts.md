* I repeat that we aim to end these anomalies but the important thing about this Bill is that it is a clear demonstration of this Government's determination to bring an end as quickly as it can to the discrimination that existed against <span class="highlight">women</span>, and in this case certain classes of <span class="highlight">women</span> such as unmarried mothers, deserted wives or wives who have been separated for other reasons.

* It is also considered that the offers of reimbursing travel and removal costs from interstate sources and the availability of housing fall well short of what could be considered an added inducement to undertake arduous work in hot and dusty conditions in a remote location with little in the way of employment for <span class="highlight">women</span>.

* I ask the Minister whether any action has been taken regarding the fixation of this set of salaries because I think - I am not quite sure of this, I am speaking from memory - that the salaries of these men and <span class="highlight">women</span> were before the Senate last year.

* I want to refer to the attitude of the Government in this matter because it does give the impression that the granting of these maternity leave provisions has fulfilled somehow the promise to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia that this Government understands the situation in which <span class="highlight">women</span> see themselves in this time of social change while it seeks to give a discriminatory benefit to only those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are employees within the Commonwealth Government instrumentalities.

* I pose the question: How does the Government see itself to be implementing something which is to be an elimination of discrimination when under this particular Bill it gives a higher benefit to <span class="highlight">women</span> who receive a high salary and a lower benefit to <span class="highlight">women</span> who receive a low salary and no benefit at all to those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not employed by the Commonwealth Public Service? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* Should it be society as a whole or should it be the industry where the <span class="highlight">women</span> are employed or should it be part of the whole social service pattern so that some maternity benefit is paid to all <span class="highlight">women</span> who have a maternity condition and who have the responsibility of the expenses of confinement and other matters related to the birth of the child? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* The fact that so many more Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> are now seeking to combine employment with their role of motherhood and home maker has brought us to the need for revision of many of our attitudes and to the stage where there will need to be  a  revision of many of what have been our conventions in this area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* If we are talking about the way in which a woman should have the freedom of choice to exercise whether she wishes to be wholly engaged as a home maker or to combine this with some career for her own fulfilment and for a national contribution to our economy, we need to consider that perhaps Government assistance will be required in the form of incentives to employers to provide more flexibility in hours and types of services in which <span class="highlight">women</span> may work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* We have all sorts of statistics to show us how many more of these <span class="highlight">women</span> are married and who have children of pre-school age, yet it has been some years since the first Gorton proposal, that the Government would create child care facilities for the children of working mothers was announced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* When we hear all of these statistics about <span class="highlight">women</span> who are in the work force in Australia, we really do have to ask: Where are they at the top level in our professions and in our commercial activity? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* If they are not yet at the top level in their chosen professions, whatever employment they have sought, we must then take up the point that was made at the end of the Minister's speech when introducing the Bill, when he said that these <span class="highlight">women</span> would be making a contribution because they had had the facilities of education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* If we regard education and training as a national investment, surely we should allow the aspirations which will flow from that to reach the top level in all of the chosen professions of the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia.

* There have been gaps in opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> and the fulfilment of <span class="highlight">women</span>'s aspirations has not yet been reached. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* I would like to think that this Government or any government in Australia would see the whole question of <span class="highlight">women</span>, their opportunities, the facilities for them to fulfil their professional careers and the ideal way in which the family structure should be protected, as part of a whole national institution and not one in which a single Bill is sought to give a discriminatory benefit only to those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are Commonwealth Government employees and then to have, as a rider to that, the fact that the Government would intervene if this principle were to be introduced in the ordinary, commercial sense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* I would have to support a Bill that gave any benefits to <span class="highlight">women</span> in their employment situation, but I question the way in which this Bill gives a handout only to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia who are in the Commonwealth Public Service and discriminates against those who are in other commercial employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* Should we really not be asking who should bear the cost of what should be a national policy in order to allow <span class="highlight">women</span> to have their right of choice in the future, namely, whether they combine their role of motherhood with a career which they may wish to pursue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* Custom, tradition, the thoughts of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are such that a Bill is introduced, the Minister makes a second reading speech and when thi debate is resumed the Opposition, the Country Party, the Democratic Labor Party and the independent group each have the right to have at least one of their senators speak.

* Yet for the sake of paltry short-term savings, as the price of losing the time and talent of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have agreed to serve their country, judges, academics, State public servants and businessmen our opponents propose to throttle these new activities; they intend to cut off the source of expert and public advice so essential to any planning for the effective, efficient, most humane and least expensive ways of dealing with Australia's accumulated social and economic problems for the rest of this century.

* In other words, whilst I think we can look forward to a social consciousness developing which will eliminate the notion of maintenance altogether, at the present stage of the development of our institutions, having regard to the fact that there is still a large generation of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have undertaken as their sole life work the upkeep of a home and the nurture of their children, account has to be taken of these people with these attitudes and in this situation in life.

* I do not think it has done the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia any good to have this special privilege in the area of widows pensions because it makes it look as though it is a problem germane only to <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia instead of what it truly is, namely a family problem in Australia.

* First, I draw attention to the fact that in October 1974 the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee circularised all doctors in Australia, drawing attention to a possible association between the use of a drug and the development of cancer of the breast in <span class="highlight">women</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* But there has been very little recognition given to the fact that the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have undertaken what we call home duties, who have occupied the traditional social role of wife, housewife and mother, have had a very large bearing in many cases on their husband's earning capacity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* But we must recognise- as against groups such as the Divorce Law Reform Association which want to see the pure theory followed without looking at these sorts of mitigating facts- that until other laws which actually determine the economic and social role of <span class="highlight">women</span> are changed, this Bill if and when it is passed must reflect those other facts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* The general statement can fairly be made that most <span class="highlight">women</span> between the ages of 25 and 40 withdraw from the work force because they become mothers and they have to care for their children to the stage when they feel the children are old enough or independent enough to look after themselves and where harm will not be done to the families if the <span class="highlight">women</span> do go out to work.

* The situation has changed rapidly, but the fact is that very many young <span class="highlight">women</span> in their late twenties and early thirties are now in the position that they left school at the age of 1 3 or 14 years, possibly did a 6 months' training course in business studies to teach them shorthand and typing, if they were lucky.

* In recent times, along with many other members of this Parliament, I have had an opportunity to meet and to mix with a large number of people, men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of varying religious and political attitudes, and it has become more and more evident to me that in reference to this piece of legislation there is in their minds a determination that they need a full measure of time to examine something which is basic to them, something which must come with a measure of change but something which they are not prepared to admit in its present immense and virtually unresearched form.

* Their theory was to arrange the economy so that it would be just about impossible for a family to subsist on one wage and, by doing so, men and <span class="highlight">women</span> would be discouraged from having children.

* The fallacy on the part of the <span class="highlight">women</span>'s movement argument is that while is rejects what it calls the sexist assumption that <span class="highlight">women</span>, by reason of their biological makeup, were destined to follow a particular sort of course in their life and that it was unnatural for them to want to do anything like follow another careerand I would agree obviously wholeheartedly with that rejection- I fear that the <span class="highlight">women</span>'s movement has appeared to impose on <span class="highlight">women</span> a different sort of assumption.

* Does the Minister accept that there are many <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not receiving supporting mother's benefit but whose domestic circumstances are such that they also need qualifications to enable them to earn a living that will cover the responsibilities, which they have taken on, of raising a family? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0)

* What has been suggested with regard to training programs for supporting mothers or for other <span class="highlight">women</span> who have family responsibilities is also consistent with our attitude towards the personal development of the individual with the opportunity to take part in the mainstream of activity in our community.

* Last year as a delegate to the United Nations conference for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year I was very privileged and interested to meet many of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who had attended the population control conference in Romania as delegates for their countries in 1974. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0)

* The <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Third World became very angry at the kinds of population control programs that were being inflicted on their sisters because those programs were based on Western values and Western technologies and completely ignored the spiritual and cultural values of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who were supposed to fit into those programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0)

* It was from many tragic experiences where <span class="highlight">women</span> involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of family and child rearing and child bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0)

* I think if  Senator Sheil  had considered what was said by <span class="highlight">women</span> delegates at that conference he would be better informed as to why some of the population control programs in the Third World had failed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0)

* It was the view of those <span class="highlight">women</span>, <span class="highlight">women</span> who were intimately involved in what is happening to their sisters in the Third World countries, that if population control is to be successful, it must bc something that the <span class="highlight">women</span> themselves want and understand and which does not destroy their whole fabric of family life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0)

* But it is certainly totally unacceptable to say this to the <span class="highlight">women</span> in villages in India or parts of Africa. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0)

* I point this out because I think that it was rather incomplete for  Senator Sheil  to talk about the failure of population control programs in the Third World without talking about what seemed to me to be the most morally significant aspect of that failure, namely, that the <span class="highlight">women</span> on whom these programs were inflicted were never consulted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0)

* Enrolments in this program have now been reduced to, I think, 30, which means that <span class="highlight">women</span> are being deprived not only of employment but also of the opportunity to acquire the skills which could lead to employment in better times.

* The National Council of Aboriginal and Island <span class="highlight">Women</span> has had its budget cut by at least 50 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0)

* That the Senate ask the Government to make such funds available as will enable projects commenced during International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year 1975 to continue and be expanded, and take urgent and immediate steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia, and to actively encourage the elimination of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in all parts of the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* I rise on this matter because I feel that, as International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year finished about two or three weeks ago, the matter should not be dropped but should be kept before the Government and the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* Because when International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year was first mooted the government of the day had long recognised that discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> was incompatible with human dignity and with the wellbeing of society, it saw International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year as a chance to highlight areas to which the community had turned a blind eye for so long. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* In the year 1974 it was thought necessary to give the world 12 months in which to recognise that there had been discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>, that there was discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> and that unless steps were taken to bring <span class="highlight">women</span> out of themselves and to realise their full potential, the world was missing out on the potential of over 50 per cent of the population. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* So it was thought necessary to nominate a year to ensure that the basic human rights of <span class="highlight">women</span> were recognised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year was seen as a year to provide opportunity to stand back and assess what had been achieved and what needed to be done. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* In many areas nobody had thought it necessary to do anything for <span class="highlight">women</span> in a particular fashion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* Some of the projects that were taken up during International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year, of which I think we should not lose sight, have only just begun and should be extended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* I refer for instance to the continued establishment of a network of community centres to respond to <span class="highlight">women</span>'s problems and to encourage their activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* People talk a lot about suburban neurosis, about the problems of the nuclear family, about the problems of <span class="highlight">women</span> from other countries who do not speak English and who are isolated in outlying areas of our major cities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* Up until this point nobody thought that by providing the sheer physical environment, a place where <span class="highlight">women</span> could meet, talk and discuss their problems, we might be going a long way towards curing some of those very real, very nasty and very modern complaints that do so much to tear the fabric of our modern society apart. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* As I was about to say, <span class="highlight">women</span> in country areas sometimes have an even harder row to hoe because at least in some areas of our cities people can occasionally board a tram- when the tram runsand go to communicate with their fellows, with people who speak the same language or with their families, although that is becoming increasingly difficult in the cities which we have created. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* <span class="highlight">Women</span> isolated in the country where they have not even a telephone cannot communicate with their fellows. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* Other areas in which <span class="highlight">women</span> needed the establishment of some sort of community centre were the areas of health, shelter, refuge, counselling and rape. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* Some very hard things have been said about the sort of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have taken advantage of these centres and the sort of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have set up these centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* But I suppose that it is a bit hard for men to understand that there are times when <span class="highlight">women</span> want to talk to people who understand exactly what their health problem is- and that is not a man. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* For very little outlay and upkeep such centres can be established where <span class="highlight">women</span> can go and find out that they are not freaks, that the things that happen to them happen to other <span class="highlight">women</span> and that somebody ought to be taking some notice of the things that happen to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* By the same token, <span class="highlight">women</span> who because of their domestic difficulties, because of overworkthere will be more of them- have broken down and have found that they cannot stand the pressure of working, keeping a family and looking after a house, need some place where they can go after the first violent reaction so that they can find their way back into the community, talk to their fellows or their peers, talk about ways to manage their lives and ways to manage the seemingly endless problems that come up. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* But in this instance I am very much aware of the fact that there needs to be a place where <span class="highlight">women</span> can go to seek shelter and refuge and some advice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* It is terrifying for <span class="highlight">women</span> more so because while their husbands go out to work and of necessity must have some contact and learn something of the community they live in, those <span class="highlight">women</span> can be locked up inside 4 walls day in day out.

* When the national secretariat for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year advertised the fact that money could be devoted to various projects coming under the heading of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Year, by 4 December 1974 the costed submissions it received amounted to $3.5m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* I am not saying that discrimination does not exist in other areas, but in this instance we will not find out how far discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> goes unless we give <span class="highlight">women</span> a chance to speak out, to talk about their needs, thoughts, worries, hopes and dreams.

* In the following few weeks I received letters from individual <span class="highlight">women</span>, groups of <span class="highlight">women</span>, scientists and doctors saying that no research had been done and that up to that point nobody had thought it terribly important that research like this be done.

* One got the distinct feeling that, because it was something that was happening to <span class="highlight">women</span> who, after all, do have babies and always have had babies, and because everybody knows how it happens- although I am not sure that everybody knows how it is brought about- nothing had been done.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* Because society now is in some ways dependent on the pill and because so many <span class="highlight">women</span> are pressured into using the pill, one would think that science would investigate very promptly, as it concerns such a large proportion of the community, the effect that the pill has on <span class="highlight">women</span> 's systems and the effect that it has on <span class="highlight">women</span> mentally, and would take immediate steps to make sure that <span class="highlight">women</span> were safeguarded against any excesses.

* This is a basic principle, because in enticing <span class="highlight">women</span> into the work force in many ways we arc getting them out there as cheap labour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* Perhaps we should think of a new name for it, because I find that in the community there are people who think that <span class="highlight">women</span> who leave work to have babies get 12 months leave on full pay. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* It is important that the <span class="highlight">women</span> who feci that they want to come back into the work force should be able to do so under the best possible conditions, but it is even more important that the <span class="highlight">women</span> who have to come back into the work force are able to do so under the best possible conditions.

* I ask the Government to look at this matter as a matter of great priority: There are <span class="highlight">women</span> being trained under the NEAT scheme who have lived on the supporting mother's benefit for a long time or who, if they have not lived on the supporting mother's benefit, have done menial jobs in the community- scrubbed floors, taken in washing and kept house for other people- to provide the sort of income they need to enable them to keep their children as best they can under the same conditions as those enjoyed by the rest of the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* By the same token there are <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who because of their domestic circumstances- they may have a husband who is an alcoholic and upon whom they can never depend to bring in a regular income but who brings in some income- should be given the chance to achieve those qualifications that will enable them to look after their families in a solid fashion without, as has been suggested to some of them by some government employees, having to leave their husbands and so entitle themselves to the supporting mother's benefit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* If we are really talking about <span class="highlight">women</span> coming into the work force and we are not doing more than paying lip service to retraining we ought to look at these things. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0)

* I know that it raises a bit of a giggle among my male colleagues and even my male constituents, but the fact of the matter is that <span class="highlight">women</span> are depicted on radio and television and in the newspapers as happy little twirps who have no mind of their own and as some sort of a vegetable that has a continual smile on its face, that is never allowed to lose its temper, that is never allowed to be a human being and that is never allowed to have hates and loves of its own.

* I do not suppose we can legislate to ensure that newspapers present us with the sort of material to read that would broaden our outlook, broaden our minds or give us more information, but at least governments could legislate for <span class="highlight">women</span> to be treated as whole human beings and not as some sort of cardboard cutout that is propped up either to sell soap powder, trucks, carpets or any other thing that happens to be going at the moment.

* I am not criticising this measure but I am criticising the claim that this improvement in the child endowment payment, by itself, constitutes some sort of independence for <span class="highlight">women</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I think there has been something of a misdirected moralism from some speakers on the Government side of the chamber which has appealed to the prejudice of some sections of the community towards the belief that somehow being a poor mother is a better position to be in than any other position a <span class="highlight">women</span> can be in in society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I bring this matter up in this debate because this kind of division of <span class="highlight">women</span> into the deserving poor mothers and the other kinds of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have jobs or who think they may like to train or study to get jobs is very mischievous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* It causes hostility between different groups of <span class="highlight">women</span> who should be supporting each other because, after all, they do have common objectives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* The situation in Australian society today- it has been the situation for a long time- is that all <span class="highlight">women</span> work at some stage of their lives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* There are very few <span class="highlight">women</span> now who do not work at some stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I think it is very mischievous for some spokesmen and spokeswomen for the conservative elements in our community to talk as though there were some contradiction between working <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span> who say at home- as though there were some serious conflict of interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* Just as most working <span class="highlight">women</span> have children and are therefore aware of the needs of families, particularly poor families, and are happy to support an increase in child endowment, so I think we should encourage <span class="highlight">women</span> who are at present at home with their children to think in terms of supporting policies for <span class="highlight">women</span> who need or wish to work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I hope that the Government in making this admirable small measure towards helping the position of poor <span class="highlight">women</span> at home will not feel that it has done enough for <span class="highlight">women</span> and will not ignore the extent of discrimination which is still suffered by <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* On pages 6 and 7 of this report there is evidence to show that discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force on the basis of sex is still extremely widespread and extremely disadvantageous to those <span class="highlight">women</span>.

* If we are to talk about giving independence and real choice to <span class="highlight">women</span>, there is much more a responsible government needs to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* The Labor Government, which was a responsible government, started to do many things in the areas of improving educational opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span>, in providing training opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span> so that when they went into the work force they could take skilled and rewarding employment, and in such things as removing tertiary fees which allowed <span class="highlight">women</span> who had never had the opportunity to undertake tertiary studies to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* Perhaps the most important thing done by the Labor Government in relation to giving <span class="highlight">women</span> real choice and independence was the formulation of a national child care program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I was quite amazed last night to hear  Senator Baume,  speaking for the Government, claim that this Bill, which increases child endowment payments, represented some sort of radical program for a genuine redistribution of wealth throughout the community, that it was innovative and that nothing like this had ever been done for <span class="highlight">women</span> or families before. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I suggest that programs started under the Labor Government, such as the National Employment and Training scheme which for the first time gave <span class="highlight">women</span> and men an opportunity to train for employment on an allowance comparable to average weekly earnings, were a much more radical step. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* Of course, the removal of discrimination within the Public Service gave more opportunities to <span class="highlight">women</span>, as did the introduction of maternity leave and, to a lesser extent, paternity leave for government employees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* The other claim that has been made during the course of this debate is that <span class="highlight">women</span> now will have a choice to stay at home and not work and that this is a choice which most <span class="highlight">women</span> want. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I also found  Senator Baume  's suggestion that this Bill recognised the productivity of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the home to be rather insulting. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I return to the question of choice for <span class="highlight">women</span> to enter the work force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I think that we in the Australian Labor Party have always considered it desirable that <span class="highlight">women</span> have a genuine choice as to whether they go to work or stay at home; but we recognised that for many <span class="highlight">women</span> there was no such choice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* Many of these, like the National Employment and Training scheme, have been wound down almost to a standstill by the present Government, thus actually reducing the genuine choice available to <span class="highlight">women</span> in this circumstance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* She said that the high proportion of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force in the last couple of years came about somehow as the result of a Labor Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* It gives some indication of the fact that the participation of married <span class="highlight">women</span> and mothers in the work force has been increasing steadily since 1947. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* For example, in 1 947 the proportion of all working <span class="highlight">women</span> who were married was 15.3 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* Similarly, the proportion of all married <span class="highlight">women</span> who were in paid employment in 1947 was 6.5 per cent; in 1 97 1 , again still during the period of a Liberal-National Country Party Government, it was 32.8 per cent; and in 1974 it was 40.5 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I hope that my reference to those figures will prevent from being made yet again in the Senate the claim that somehow the high participation of mothers and married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force was a phenomenon that came about only as a result of the Labor Government and somehow as a result of pressures put on families by the Labor Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* It was these sorts of pressures that caused <span class="highlight">women</span> to go out to work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* Other sorts of pressures that caused <span class="highlight">women</span> to go out to work in the 1 950s and particularly in the 1960s included the fact that Federal funding of education was so low that <span class="highlight">women</span> felt they had to go to work to be able to improve the educational opportunities of their children by sending them to private schools, which they considered at that time to be better, or by supplementing their children's educational resources through the purchase of books, extra lessons, tutoring and things of that kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* I suggest that, if we really want to understand why married <span class="highlight">women</span> went into the work force in such large numbers during that period, we can gain enlightenment on the subject from the sorts of policies pursued by the Liberal-National Country Party Government during that time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* It is totally inaccurate to try to look at such a complex social change as the change in life style of married <span class="highlight">women</span> and families in terms of anything that might have happened during the  5  years of the Labor Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* There are certainly many more steps that this Government can take if it is at all interested in improving opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* As to my first reason for speaking, I agree with  Senator Ryan  that part of the reason why <span class="highlight">women</span> were forced into the work force was the development of consumerism and materialism to the extent that there were socially created wants instead of needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* These forced <span class="highlight">women</span> out into the work force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* That factor was the combination of forces resulting from employers and the Department of Labour and National Service seeking to attract <span class="highlight">women</span> into the labour force as a source of cheap labour prior to the introduction of equal pay. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* The trade union movement was conscious of the fact that if the employers and the Department of Labour and National Service were allowed to get away with their campaign to attract a large number of <span class="highlight">women</span> into the work force as a source of cheap labour, obviously that would have a most disastrous effect on employment opportunities and wage standards of breadwinners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* In addition, and most importantly, the trade union movement sought to achieve equality- that is, equal pay for work of equal value- for <span class="highlight">women</span> as of right. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* We did have a large number of complaints whilst I was a member of that Committee from <span class="highlight">women</span> because they were discriminated against in their employment and occupation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* To emphasise the point that I made on a previous occasion that many <span class="highlight">women</span> at home are discriminated against in their occupation, I wish to quote from a letter that was written to the Tasmanian Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation by a  Mrs H.  M. Speden. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0)

* Of course, as my colleague the shadow Minister for Primary Industry said, it is a crying shame that in a nation where <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in the industrial areas in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth cannot afford to buy fruit the only solution that can be found to try to improve the lot of the canned fruit industry is the scheme brought in by the McMahon Government to pull trees out so that fruit would be dearer.

* I presume that the word 'those' includes exservicewomen, because at the moment there is no provision in most of the previous Acts, including the War Service Homes Act, for a great number of ex-servicewomen who were in the Services during the war but who did not serve overseas.

* Are we talking about thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> who will suddenly apply for this benefit, or are we talking about a few hundred <span class="highlight">women</span> who are at an age- the war finished 30-odd years ago- at which they need security and the advantage of knowing that they have decent, comfortable accommodation for which they can afford to pay and which will be provided for them in their old age.

* Single ex-servicemen get loans for homes and nobody begrudges the widows of ex-servicemen the benefits that they receive; but I am talking about the <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly those <span class="highlight">women</span> who were quite prepared to sacrifice themselves if necessary, who sacrified their time and their human resources in wartime service.

* There has not been any move by this Government not only to increase funding for the <span class="highlight">women</span>'s refuges which are at present operating throughout the States but also to spend more money on providing the shelters for which <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly those in Western Australia, have a need.

* I think the fact that 1,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> turned up to seek 80 jobs demonstrates something of the extent of unemployment amongst married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian Capital Territory.

* One might add to those bald unemployment figures the fact that a survey done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May 1977 showed that in Australia there were 72,500 people working part time who were anxious to obtain full time employment but could not do so, and that there were another 200,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia who wanted to obtain employment but could not do so.

* However, what is not acknowledged by the Government or by anyone else, it would seem, is the circumstances facing <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly married <span class="highlight">women</span>, who have lost their employment and their livelihood because of the current economic recession. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* Yet, if we look at what has happened to <span class="highlight">women</span> in our community who have exercised the choice to be part of the work force, who have shown the incentive to go out to work for the improvement of their families or for thenself fulfilment, who have had the motivation to be constructive and energetic about their community and about their families, we find that the Government has totally ignored what has happened to them when they face unemployment.

* Let us examine some of those international covenants and compare what is contained in them with what is the real situation in Australia today, specifically in regard to unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> workers and what the Government has done, or to be more accurate, has failed to do about them.

* Despite the fact that <span class="highlight">women</span> have constituted one-third of the work force until very recently, the unemployment rate for <span class="highlight">women</span> as measured is higher than the rate for men in every category, and this is despite the fact that the mechanisms for recording the number of unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> are quite unsatisfactory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* I say 'married persons', not 'married <span class="highlight">women</span>', because the Act does not discriminate on the basis of sex. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* Because of that extremely discriminatory situation, most married <span class="highlight">women</span> who lose their jobs and whose husbands remain in employment simply do not go to a Commonwealth Employment Service office to register as unemployed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* The overworked and understaffed staff at the Commonweath Employment Service offices do discourage <span class="highlight">women</span> in these circumstances from registering as unemployed because they recognise that those <span class="highlight">women</span>, or men if that happens to be the case, are not eligible for the unemployment benefit and indeed their chances of finding employment through the Commonwealth Employment Service are very small indeed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* Generally speaking, married <span class="highlight">women</span> do not register as unemployed and therefore they are not counted in the unemployment statistics which are measured regularly by the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* Despite the fact that so many <span class="highlight">women</span> do not register, for the reasons that I have just explained, the unemployment statistics still show a higher rate of unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">women</span> than amongst men in every category and in some categories it is quite disastrously higher. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* Despite the difficulty of measuring the extent of unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">women</span>, an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey called 'Persons not in the Work Force' which was published recently claims that at least 200,000 <span class="highlight">women</span>- that is nearly a quarter of a million <span class="highlight">women</span>- are looking for jobs but cannot enter the work force either because there are not any jobs available or because child minding facilities are totally inadequate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* It shows that 15,900 unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> are considered by employers to be too young or too old for work, whatever that may mean. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* So, in a way that is quite different from that for men and in a way that shows that they are much more disadvantaged than men, <span class="highlight">women</span> often are judged to be too young or too old for work which they would be qualified to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* We find- I think this is particularly significant 11,000 unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> giving unsuitable hours- that is, shift work- as the reason why they cannot take employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* It is the case, of course, that the Government has maintained in a way the child care program which was initiated by the Labor Government, but it certainly has not been prepared to put resources or planning into it so that the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> needing child care facilities to enable them to take employment would be in a position to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* So, those 11,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> who are unable to take employment, even if they could find it, because of a lack of child care services will continue to experience a lack of child care service in the forthcoming year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* But from the point of view of ethics- this will be repugnant to a few Government senators- I have been to eastern Europe many times and seen things with which one would agree and with which one would not agree, but I have never known a European radio or television station to use <span class="highlight">women</span> as show ponies in order to sell goods.

* The problem cannot be solved by discriminating against married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force, as some have suggested; rather, the solution lies in Government financial measures which will recognise the economic worth of the homemaker, contribution to family support programs and thus reverse the economic discrimination now experienced by single income families.

* If those programs are adopted the majority of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force who, according to recent surveys such as those conducted by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Electrical Trades Union, have been forced to enter the work force through economic pressure will have a true freedom of choice and the option to leave jobs, thus creating employment opportunities for the young.

* When one adds to that the kind of separation factor which is now of two years' standing and the stress that causes to <span class="highlight">women</span> with children who are on their own in Australia, one sees that a very real social problem is developing about which we believe the Government should be quick and alert to do something.

 - Mr President, I regret having to speak on the adjournment but I must do so in view of an answer that was given to a question by me on 16 March concerning the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> 's Centre in Melbourne.

* Before attempting to explain why  Mr Ellicott  's fulsome praise of the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> 's Centre, which prompted my question to  Senator Guilfoyle,  was thoroughly inappropriate, there is one matter which I should make clear at the outset. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* Quite simply, the Sara Dowse parable indicates that while she was working as an adviser to this Government her first loyalty was always to a non-Public Service organisation, the <span class="highlight">Women</span> 's Electoral Lobby, and that she saw the <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Electoral Lobby and its attitudes as providing an integrated backdrop for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Affairs Branch of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

* I have been told by a union official in Melbourne that a possible reason for the official trade union hostility is that on several occasions <span class="highlight">women</span> associated with the centre have attempted to by-pass the elected officials of unions and enter factories and work places in order to spread their propaganda. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* Certainly, abortion is of interest- controversial interest- to all men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, whether they are working or not, but is the promotion of abortion the purpose for which Federal Government funds are used? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* One might think that we are getting closer at last to something which deals directly with working <span class="highlight">women</span> but the purpose of the broadsheet becomes clear when one reads right through it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* The two principal <span class="highlight">women</span> at the Centre- Sylvie Shaw and Mary Owen- have both been prominently involved with the <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Electoral Lobby. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* When  Senator Guilfoyle  announced last year the Government's grant of $8,000 to the Centre and another grant to an organisation in Sydney, she stated in her Press release that she was particularly pleased that the Government had been able to assist these two organisations 'which had been established by working <span class="highlight">women</span> to help themselves'.

* Mr Ellicott  's remarks were an insult to all of those unions which, in their own way and under their own rules, free of pressure from extreme radical feminists, are attempting to do something for their <span class="highlight">women</span> members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0)

* If the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>'s Centre in Melbourne got rid of its partisan political propaganda attitude, confined itself to genuine working issues and was not so closely identified organisationally with WEL and other groups one might anticipate that the official trade union movement would reconsider its approach to it.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0)

* As those three bodies represent specific groups of <span class="highlight">women</span>- professional <span class="highlight">women</span>, country <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span> from one religious group -and in view of the fact that when last September the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span> was told by the Government Office of Child Care in Canberra that it was one of only three organisations that had shown any interest in the Year of the Child, will the Minister increase the membership of the Committee to give wider representation, including representation of the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span> which has done a deal of work on its own on this important matter? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0)

* Many organisations, including the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>, which have made representations to be on a national committee or to work in connection with the observance of the International Year of the Child may find that they are invited by State governments to be on their committees.

* I do not think that there is any need to go over the important innovations in the original legislation of 1 976- for example, the introduction of a uniform 5 per cent contribution provision with an option to contribute to up to 10 per cent, a wide range of new benefits, and some special provisions important to temporary employees, <span class="highlight">women</span> and the handicapped.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* Of the remainder, there are three main recommendations: Firstly, that private free-standing abortion clinics should not operate in the Australian Capital Territory; secondly, that there should be a clinic, conducted by the Capital Territory Health Commission, within the grounds of a public hospital, to perform abortions authorised by law up to 11 weeks of pregnancy; and thirdly, that all <span class="highlight">women</span> having abortions performed in the Australian Capital Territory after 1 1 weeks and up to 20 weeks of pregnancy should be in-patients in a public hospital. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* The designating of facilities- for example, the setting aside of some portion of the building as a clinic in which counselling and termination of pregnancies may take place in the first 1 1 weeks of pregnancyand the provision of in-patient care for <span class="highlight">women</span> between the 11th and 20th week of pregnancy are matters for the Capital Territory Health Commission acting under its own Ordinance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* That is a fact which is inescapable and, as between <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking an abortion in Sydney and <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking an abortion in Canberra, there is a discrepancy, a discrimination, which is important and which I believe would have been important in the deliberations of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* But I do take the view, which I believe is strongly supported by circumstantial evidence, by facts and by the history of the abortion debate over many years, that, whatever this Senate does in relation to legislative proscription regarding abortion, abortions will still be sought by <span class="highlight">women</span> and will still take place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* The significant point that I seek to make from the law as it has been and still is in most legislative prescriptions is that, however we might like to characterise abortion, the fact of the matter is that many <span class="highlight">women</span> who are confronted with a difficult moral and social problem do not see it in that way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* I find it appalling that the people who take the anti-abortion line can seriously believe that <span class="highlight">women</span> have abortions for cosmetic reasons, that <span class="highlight">women</span> take abortions lightly, that they have them for no serious reason but just for their own convenience.

* Under present procedures, as I understand the matter, this committee of six may not necessarily include a woman although it sometimes does; that <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking termination are not allowed to put their cases personally to that committee but only through a doctor, and that terminations are carried out more or less in parallel with other hospital procedures using the same staff, who may or may not wish to be involved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* If its experience is that <span class="highlight">women</span> of the type described in the Estimates committee do provide the service which is required by the Bureau, I think it would be an extremely odd thing if the Government intervened and told the Bureau that it should use these people to find pockets of unemployment that could be relieved and to get rid of its existing staff.

* That is not the situation and, as a result of the lack of child care facilities and, now, the necessity for a woman to be really ill before she can use up her sick leave credits as well, we will see <span class="highlight">women</span> returning to the work force, because they need to hold their jobs, before they are properly fit to do so, or have been able to make really satisfactory arrangements for their small babies.

* If the Government had a more flexible staffing policy with regard to the Public Service those <span class="highlight">women</span> absent on maternity leave could be replaced just as other employees on sick leave, recreation leave, study leave, long service leave or any other form of leave available to all public servants are replaced or should be replaced temporarily by other officers.

* As I see it, there is no stated Government policy, in these documents or elsewhere, which says that that is the aim, but the deliberate pressure, both in the past and at present, on married <span class="highlight">women</span> to enter the paid work force has helped to promote the trend.

* The fact that there are only 23 <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Second Division of the Australian Public Service reflects, in part, the fact that until late 1966 married <span class="highlight">women</span> were precluded from becoming officers in the Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110)
