### Sample sentences:

* We will hold those five seats at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> because we are a united team determined to do something for Tasmania and in particular to restore our State from the damage caused to it during the Whitlam years of 1972-75.

* The Constitution provides that if the Senate in certain circumstances twice rejects Bills passed by the House of Representatives, the GovernorGeneral may dissolve the Parliament and new elections may be held.

* Debate on this Bill is long overdue: Is the reason why the Government does not bring this Bill on for debate because the Government wishes to continue with the present electoral set up in Australia which favours a system which elects to this Parliament 22 members of 1 Party which, at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, across the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, polled less than 8 per cent of the total vote?

* Therefore, I shall say at the outset that I completely support the Bill to alter the Constitution so as to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives elections.

* He will recall the present Prime Minister guaranteeing in Hobart during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that Tasmania would not be disadvantaged in respect to shipping freights as compared with freight rates on the mainland.
