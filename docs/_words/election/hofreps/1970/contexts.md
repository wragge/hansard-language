* The conclusionsI have reached after a most detailed and exhaustive study of the relevant documents are as follows: In my opinion the honourable member for Farrer when acting as  Chairman  of the Australian Mineral Council at the meeting of 26th September expressed the view that because of the impending <span class="highlight">election</span> it was impossible for him to know what the Government would do or whether he would be in a position to influence its actions or decisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0)

* Can it ever be said that it was not unprecedented, immediately after winning an <span class="highlight">election</span> for a former Minister of the Crown, quite deliberately and sanely, to say that he was not prepared to serve in the same Ministry or in the same Cabinet as a victorious Prime Minister? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0)

* It is essential to the case that is being made against the Government today firstly that there should be shown to have been a commitment given on behalf of the Government at the meeting held on 26th September 1969 that the incoming Government, assuming it were the same Government in political colour, coming into office after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, agreed that it would not introduce unilaterally legislation with respect of off-shore minerals without, as a necessary pre-condition of introducing that legislation, first consulting with the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0)

* But more importantly than that, if one is to look at the second part of the case made against the Government, those who seek to press this attack must demonstrate, and demonstrate according to a pretty heavy burden of proof - because this is, as everybody agrees, a serious charge - that those members who took office in the Government after the general <span class="highlight">election</span> of October 1969 knew that the honourable member for Farrer when a Minister had given this commitment, but proceeded to disregard it before, and at any time up to, the point when the Cabinet made its decision, I think in late January, to legislate.

* It was apparently considered in July and August, when the correspondence took place between the honourable member for Farrer and the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  that it was not an appropriate time to have another meeting with the State Mines Ministers, having regard to the busy programme in connection with the Budget and the forthcoming general <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* Follow ing the yet unhonoured <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  to reduce exorbitant taxation on the lower and middle income groups, there is no alternative but to resort to the latter controls, that is, to the control of money supply and interest.

* I am very proud to say that a large proportion of the people of Australia, whether they have supported all the decisions that the Government has made since the <span class="highlight">election</span> or whether they have not, at least have been singularly high in their praise of the Government for at least making decisions and of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  for at least acting as a Prime Minister should.

* We on this side of the House who were honoured to be members of the last Parliament know full well that the opportunity was taken by the people of Australia on the occasion of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> to cast out the Liberal-Country Party coalition and to elect the Labor Party into office after 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule despite the gutter tactics that were used and despite the lies of the previous government and particularly those of the Democratic Labor Party.

* Support for communists and denigration of our allies, not only by the Prime Minister but by any of his Cabinet who choose to shoot off his mouth has become the accepted mean; If it was not so disastrous to the nation it would be humorous to recall the words of the - American Ambassador who, just before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> said that he did not see any variation in Australian-United States relations if the Australian Labour Party won the <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* It is most unexpected that a Government should have acted so badly so soon after its <span class="highlight">election</span> - a performance so poor as to deserve censure in the first week of the new Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0)

* While the Government can claim that some of its actions have been taken as a result of the mandate given to it - a mandate that was by no means overwhelming - the Australian people were not aware or expecting, let alone told, that the degree of national political realignment following the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government would be so radical and pursued with such indecent haste. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0)

* But if we read the 'Australian* of 27th February - a journal which was not noticeably unsympathetic to the Prime Minister during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign - we learn that the Prime Minister's self-assumed mantle of an Evatt-style world statesman has been hit for six by his Indonesian escapades. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0)

* It is valid for the Left to support the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Australian Labor Party to government, at the same time attempting to develop approaches and initiatives which would bind the Government to a left-wing course of action when it took office.

* After uttering soothing words in the period prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> about the importance it attached to the Five Power Arrangements and playing down those provisions in the ALP platform which required it to bring the troops back to Australia, it was confronted with the imminent visit of Lord Carrington. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0)

* I do not say this in any political sense, but on the eve of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, for some unknown reason, the Liberal Party decided to demolish the Prime Minister's suite. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0)

 Mr DALY (Grayndler - Leader of the House (3.51)  -  in reply - Anybody listening to the debate this afternoon, particularly the speeches from the Opposition side, would have no doubts as to why honourable members opposite were rejected at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* We recognise above all things that just as our basic task in this Parliament is to oppose, to criticise and to scrutinise, equally our task is to initiate, to formulate and to develop new policies upon which the people of this country can make their judgment when the next <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place.

* In view of this, it was more than a matter of surprise that the present AttorneyGeneral,  Senator Murphy,  made an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in November 1972 stating that a Labor government would introduce and establish a women's bureau in the Department of Labour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0)

* Clause 20 contains the general provision that at the time of each general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives an <span class="highlight">election</span> of members for the Territory is to be held.

* It reaches its culmination when the local mayor or member ends by running for <span class="highlight">election</span> against him. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* Was this intended to refer rather to the extent of representation - for example, the number of representatives - and the terms of representation in the sense in which one refers to the manner of their appointment or <span class="highlight">election</span> or is it without express mention, a way of altering earlier sections in Part II of the Constitution? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* They are to run for <span class="highlight">election</span> always at elections held for the House of Representatives and clearly only on House of Representatives issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* I would not oppose a proposal such as was put forward in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the Constitution in 1959 to bring the Senate elections into line with the House of Representatives elections by making senators have, say, 2 consecutive Representatives terms as their term of office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* However, while I was Attorney-General, I sought to devise a scheme by which this could be done and I presented a paper in which, with some variation of what had been proposed in 1959 by the Committee, a scheme was propounded which would make it possible for senators to be elected for about 6 years - 2 successive House of Representatives terms - still being elected in succession, overlapping each other, and so that always, the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives would be synchronised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* Their <span class="highlight">election</span> will be at a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in which the issues are different. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* Taking the last 3 House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> figures for the Australian Capital Territory as a basis it is clear that, on one occasion cer tainly and on the last 2 occasions probably, on distribution of preferences they would have produced 2 Senate representatives from one side of the House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is suggested that this method of appointing 2 senators for the short term coming after the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and having 2 senators possibly carrying the balance of power in the States chamber should not be put into effect before the States have had an opportunity, as the Constitution really contemplates, of passing their opinion on the matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* I am reminded that as long ago as 1970 the then Prime Minister spoke during a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in which 1 was elected to this House in support of the proposition that the size of the Australian Capital Territory was such - I quote him loosely because I do not have his exact words in front of me - that it either was or shortly would be ready for increased representation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* However it is indicative of the different thinking of the 2 Parties - the Liberal and Country Parties on one side saying: 'We will not, because we cannot see advantage for ourselves in it', and the Labor Government saying: 'We will honour an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that has been in our policy for many years to do the right thing by the Northern Territory even if we cannot take advantage to ourselves as a Party from it, and we will do the right thing by the Australian Capital Territory at the same time'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* I can tell this House right now that if Jim Fraser had run at another <span class="highlight">election</span> or had stood behind a candidate for this place one of the things that he would have been saying from the platform in that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign would have been that the job of representing the ACT is too big for one man. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* He should have remained throughout that term without a vote and then should have gone to <span class="highlight">election</span> when we would have had a member elected who had voting rights, that matter being determined by the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* I repeat that the conferring of the right to vote in this House on the member of the Northern Territory when it was done in mid-term and not as a condition of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in which he was originally elected was one of the most disgraceful episodes in the electoral history of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* The commissioners may need more than 10 per cent to achieve one vote one value at the time of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, depending on the capacity of growth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* The term of service of  a  senator for a Territory commences on the day of his <span class="highlight">election</span> and expires  at  the close of the day next preceding the polling day for the general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House  of  Representatives next following his <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* Furthermore, if he thinks that this is part of a sinister plot of the Labor Party completely to dominate and control the Parliament by the <span class="highlight">election</span> of these senators, I suggest that he should have a chat with the  President  of the Liberal Party in the Australian Capital Territory who thinks that it is a first class Bill and that it should be introduced by the Opposition side of the House even if the Government did not do it in this session.

* Also, apart from that is the consideration that every person who has a responsibility to vote in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Parliament should exercise it consistent with the laws of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0)

* I would suggest that the Minister for Defence study this in conjunction with clause 25 (1) and sub-clause (3) for it is my interpretation that some hundreds of service members could be penalised by the inclusion of these words 'but for', which would deprive them of the right of making an <span class="highlight">election</span> referred to in sub-clause (3).

* But if I may come back to the historical background of this legislation it was quite clear that a policy decision made by the Opposition back in 1972 which was outlined to the people of this country during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of December 1972 proposed that the DFRB legislation would be introduced in this Autumn session of the Parliament.

* For 6 months prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Labor Party was making unconditional <span class="highlight">election</span> promises that it would require the Australian National Line to operate the Straitsman' which has been tied up in Melbourne since 4 June, and to start an immediate shipping operation to King Island, which would carry a separate subsidy account.

* I am sure that the result of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span>, which would be the pattern in other parts of Australia, measures the amount of the popular disillusion with this Government, which is a temporary Government.

* I ask: Where development, technical and environmental considerations can thus be harmonised and are further supported by the economics of the matter, and still the environmental viewpoint is overruled, does not the Treasurer agree that the professed concern of his party and his Government for the environment, which it is said was an important factor in their winning the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, is humbug and a sham?

* During this time the standard of personal living and affluence of the people of this nation raced ahead of that in most other nations and I could not but feel amazed that this Government, after so many years and so many <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and after having set itself up as champion of the small man, the wage earner and the small business man, could introduce a Budget so devoid of any policy to deal with the crippling rate of inflation.

* When the effect of that policy starts to show up in increases in mortgage repayments, when the bond rate goes up to 8i per cent and when the lending rates of institutions such as building societies and insurance companies operating in this field go up to 10 per cent or more, the man in the street and in particular those people who were led by <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to expect not higher mortgage repayments on their houses but an effective reduction as the interest component in that was to be made tax deductible, will rise up in anger at the actions of this Government in seeking not to attack inflation in this Budget but in this way to throw the whole weight of attacking it onto monetary policy.

* The honourable gentleman this afternoon has sought to encourage the House to accept one simple proposition, which is that this Bill is a simple measure merely calling for the simultaneous .<span class="highlight">election</span> of both Houses of the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* It would mean that every time there was a political disturbance in this House which forced the Leader of the Government of the day to hand in his commission or, rather more pointedly, to go to the Governor-General and say 'I ask you to dissolve the House of Representatives' the effect of that would simply be that half of the Senate would have to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> again for no reason at all other than a political disturbance which had taken place in this chamber. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* In that period the Senate and the House of Representatives' elections were not in conjunction and yet at no time did the government of the day decide to go to the people to bring them into line so that money would be saved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* The result was that in that period elections cost the Australian people say another $7m because the Senate and House of Representatives elections were not held in conjunction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Minister for Services and Property mentioned that the conjoint elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives in 1961 cost $866,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Committee has recommended (19S8 Report, paragraph 49) that the Constitution be altered to omit the provision now made for senators to be chosen for terms of six years and to provide instead that senators should hold their places until the expiry or dissolution of the second House of Representatives after their <span class="highlight">election</span>, unless the Senate should be earlier dissolved under the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* But I do fundamentally question the present 'out of phase' state of our electoral process, requiring us to conduct in each 3-year period one House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and one separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* As part and parcel of the exercise of the bicameral system, under our Constitution the Government represents the party with the majority in the lower House and the party with the majority in the lower House at any House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> need not have a majority in the upper House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* The House of Representatives has always had in its power the capacity to go to the people and to synchronise elections if it so desires or if it does not so desire, to call elections out of phase for the House of Representatives alone or to call for a double dissolution subject to the approval of the Governor-General. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* So there is a flexibility within the Constitution which enables the Government to go to the people and seek another mandate through its majority in the House of Representatives, to go to the people by way of a double dissolution or to go to the people by way of an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives at the time of the normal 3- yearly <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the members of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* For example, under the British parliamentary system the House of Lords lacks the power that the Senate, the Upper House in this Parliament, enjoys; that is, the power to deny the passage of legislation and the power to force the Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* A 6-year term gives a senator a measure of independence which a relationship between his term of office and a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> would deny him. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* I believe that a case can be set out for the retention of that independence, related alone to the fact that when elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives are out of phase people register a more meaningful vote for their senators. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* I believe that when a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place at the time of a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the very nature of this chamber, the nature of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of government, the nature of policies that originate in this chamber and the machinations of power that those who abuse it in the Labor Party seek, are likely to distort the democratic process, and particularly the democratic process that applies to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators.

* Sir George  Turner went on: which is not very likely to happen in connection with the Federal Parliament - we may allow an <span class="highlight">election</span> for senators and for representatives at certain times to take place together, and by that means save a considerable amount of expense.

* My figures are a little different from those of the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  but the fact is that it is the economic question that ought to be considered when we talk of synchronising the elections for both Houses.

* In his second reading speech the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  made the point- I think this would be accepted by all those who have followed the discussion on this Bill in this House and prior to its presentation to this House- that with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government in 1972 came a new approach to Australia's railway problems.

* The only reason that they would call for a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> at the moment, of course, would be to .save the skin of the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  because there has been set in motion, which is the appropriate term to use.

* It is true that the Government has reversed many of its economic policies and has adopted a number of those proposed by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  which, incidentally, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  rubbished and ridiculed in his usual manner during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last May.

* Until probably four or five weeks ago there was a possibilitysome people believed there was even a likelihood- of an <span class="highlight">election</span> being fought in the middle of this year, and the Liberal Party had given an undertaking that Medibank would not be perservered with if that Party won the <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* The new Leader of the Opposition went further and quite correctly said what we have been saying for some time- that Medibank had been an issue in at least 2 elections, that it had certainly been an issue in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that there had been a double dissolution and a Joint Sitting of the 2 Houses of Parliament during which Medibank had been accepted, and that it is now law.

* So we have the spectacle under their proposal of, on the one hand, a person who says that he will not join a trade union, who does not vote, who does not pay anything, who does not take any part in union affairs at all and who has committed no breach, and on the other hand, a person who joins a union on a voluntary basis, who attends every union meeting for a period of 5 years, who pays his union dues and plays an active part in the union but who, because he forgets to vote in a union <span class="highlight">election</span>, can be fined under this ludicrous and stupid proposal.

* As with the parent Electoral Laws Amendment Bill itself, the proposals contained in these 6 Bills, taken as a whole, are designed to implement improved voting facilities; to provide more realistic and less cumbersome voting procedures which will assist electors to exercise their franchise effectively by the recording of valid votes; to permit a speedier finalisation of <span class="highlight">election</span> results and to reduce the scope for electoral malpractice in any guise.

* As honourable members are aware, under the existing preferential system, each voter, irrespective of his or her individual wish, is compelled to rank in order of preference all the candidates on a Senate ballot paper, even where this requires the sequential numbering of 73 squares, as was the case for the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales.

* It is true that if all voters deliberately refrained from expressing any preferences beyond the first preference, the result under optional preferential voting in an <span class="highlight">election</span> for a member of the House of Representatives would be the same as in a first past the post system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0)

* It can be said that the optional preferential procedure ensures that meaningful preferences are distributed whereas the present system can lead to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a candidate with a manufactured majority based on what may well be preferences randomly assigned by the voters.

* 2) 1975, this is a non-partisan reform which is designed to introduce a system of voting which provides for the maximum flexibility and democratic freedom of choice for the voters while maintaining the essential elements of a full preferential system, should the voters choose to indicate preferences for all candidates in the <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* The proposed variation in the conditions governing forfeiture of deposit at House of Representatives and Senate elections, and the new schedule of electoral offences and punishments, are matters which met with substantial agreement when the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill was before the House and I do not feel that there is a need for me to deal further with these aspects in respect of the present Bill.

* The 1974 Senate elections in New South Wales, when there were 73 candidates, and to a lesser extent the 1 974 Senate elections in certain other States, gave a clear indication of what might happen in the future unless a sufficient deterrent is introduced to operate against frivolous candidature or candidature designed to infringe upon, or obstruct, the democratic process of <span class="highlight">election</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0)

* To turn to a further reform proposed in this Bill, the Government believes that, given the present ineligibility of members of State parliaments to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Australian Parliament, it would be appropriate for a member of the legislature of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory to be placed in the same category.

* This Bill, the last in the series of Bills incorporating proposals previously contained in the Electoral Laws Amendment BUI, provides for: A speedier finalisation of <span class="highlight">election</span> results, by introducing an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and by providing for the return of postal votes direct to the respective returning officer; prohibition on the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in certain specified circumstances; restriction of postal vote application forms to be used at an <span class="highlight">election</span> or referendum to those specified by notice in the Australian Government Gazette; postal voting faculties for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; discretion to appoint a licensed or registered surveyor as a Distribution Commissioner in lieu of the Surveyor-General of the State concerned; and other minor amendments to the existing electoral law.

* As honourable members are well aware, the present electoral system involves intolerable delays in finalising the <span class="highlight">election</span> results, particularly when a large number of postal votes is admitted to the scrutiny as was the case in the 1974 House of Representatives elections when almost 5 per cent of the total votes recorded throughout Australia were postal votes.

* There is a growing tendency for party workers to take advantage of the existing provision which enables a person to examine the postal vote applications in the office of a divisional returning officer, to compile a list of electors who voted by post at the <span class="highlight">election</span> and to use this list to forward postal vote applications to the persons concerned at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, without knowing whether those persons are still eligible to vote by post.

* This must be done, as I say, for the sake of the safety and security of this country even when it means that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held at a time when the party elected to power has had a shorter period in office than the term for which it was elected.

* Unfortunately, because of the expressed rights of the colonies at the time and because they felt there was a need to have a States House, which after federation rapidly became a Party House, the situation developed- and it exists at the present time- where the Senate in certain circumstances could refuse Supply and thus force the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> without having to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26)

* We should think very seriously about this matter because we could reach a situation where a party or a number of parties with the majority in the Senate could continue to refuse Supply regardless of what happened in an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26)

* I can recall that, when I was on the staff of the Reserve Bank and prior to that in the exchange control department of the central banking division of the Commonwealth Bank, I came across some highly confidential and highly politically explosive information which could have brought about the downfall of the Menzies Government in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1961- an <span class="highlight">election</span> which that Government won by only 2 seats.

* It is not a matter of whether the Budget pleases the Senate; the point is that the Senate has no right at all to force any elected government to the polls, not because it does not have a majority in this Chamber, not because it lacks a majority on the floor of the House of Representatives, not because it does not have the support of the people at an <span class="highlight">election</span> but because it does not have the money to govern.

* Of course, the motive behind the whole package of the proposals being put to this Parliament now for the third time in under 12 months is that the legislation if passed would greatly help the Australian Labor Party get more votes, and in the present political climate preserve more of its members when we next go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* I put it to the House that the Leader of the House should have further qualified those remarks by saying that if a sufficient number of voters in an optional preferential system refrained from expressing a preference, the result would be the same because the example I have given to the House shows precisely the same effect in that it leads to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a person who has received less than 50 per cent of the formal vote.

* But of course it was quite legitimate that the Minister should use those words because previously during the Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  campaigned there strongly but he did not do very well- the Prime Minister made some comments and the Minister supported him in his statement 6 months later.

* Yet I believe in effect the <span class="highlight">election</span> was about the loans affair; it was about Labor's bid to gain public equity of a substantial degree in Australia's resources; it was about the world's biggest supply of natural gas worth thousands of millions of dollars lying off the North- West Shelf of Australia of which people were demanding delivery.

* Elections involving the Australian Railways Union were estimated to cost $40,248, elections involving the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation were estimated to cost $34,643, and elections involving the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union were estimated to cost $22,195. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* One can see that a candidate standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> in that sort of system could face the problem of having to run a campaign costing $20,000, $30,000, $50,000 and perhaps more in order just to get his name across, in some superficial sense, to every member of the union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* It could well be the case that a better system in such a union would be to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> for office bearers at a regional or State level where the campaign would not be so costly.

* All honourable members will recall that during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Government said time and time again that it proposed to legislate, upon regaining the Government benches, to provide that all union members would have a postal vote, or the ability to have a postal vote, in union elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* I put as a natural extension of the federalist philosophy which I adopt the argument that, in my opinion at any rate, if the collegiate system is taken away the smaller States can say goodbye to any chance of having an effective role to play in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of federal office bearers of their unions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* The legislation makes it clear that unions that had the collegiate system then had the right to continue the collegiate system  ad infinitum  except that those federal positions within the union that were full time jobs and the holder of which was a member of the management committee of the organisation, had to go to the rank and file for <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* It clearly shows that the Australian people are bedevilled by frequent elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* If this referendum is not passed we will have 4 elections within the next 5 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* It would cost some $4m or $5m per <span class="highlight">election</span> with the people themselves well divided on that issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* Again, in a cynical fashion, one wonders whether this would be a primary concern of the Government at this stage if it was not aware of the fact that unless this is done it will face a halfSenate <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1978, some 6 months before it was due to go to the polls. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* The motivation of the people when they cast their votes for the <span class="highlight">election</span> for a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in accordance with the policies expressed by political parties would also flow to the Senate candidates being elected at the same time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* The Constitution, the law and Parliamentary practice each Prime Minister to have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> on the same day as any Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* Under section 13, if one wanted to get elections back into kilter one could put forward a phoney proposition to a tame and friendly Senate, which would reject it, and then one could ask for a double dissolution around the end of June and organise an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives some time in July. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* At least by virtue of the referendum proposals we are now bringing before the Australian people they will know that if they elect a Liberal senator or a Labor senator at an <span class="highlight">election</span> and that senator ceases to hold office for any purpose whatsoever during the ensuing period of his term of office, he will be replaced by a Liberal senator or a Labor senator as the case may be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* I said to the Attorney-General earlier- I have considered the matter carefully and have reviewed the view that I previously took- that it was a pity, as I then thought, that the right of State Governors to fix the time for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was being taken from them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* But it has been correctly pointed out to me that that in fact has to be done to give efficacy to the amendment and that, in any event, in respect of double dissolutions it will be the Governor-General of Australia and not the State Governors who will declare the time and the date for the appropriate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in conjunction with that for the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* That this Convention affirms the principle that a casual vacancy in the Senate, should, in order to maintain the principle of proportional representation and the wishes of the people of the State at the relevant Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, be filled by a member of the same political party as the senator whose vacancy is to be filled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* The new senator supported the Government on some vital issues, such as the passage of Supply, but he voted against the Government on other important issues such as the redistribution for which given the results of the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span> of 18 May 1974 the Government had a clear mandate.

* A political party may choose to nominate as a candidate for appointment to the Senate someone whom it would not be prepared to put on its party ticket at an <span class="highlight">election</span> because that party might know that the person whom they were nominating would not have public appeal and might in fact lose it votes if he had to face an <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* The occasions when I get least enthusiasm from my own Party supporters- I am sure this is the experience of honourable members opposite- is when they have to get out and campaign for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> only and not for their local member in the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* For many years my Party has advocated simultaneous elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* The Government wants to avoid that like the plague because it knows that when that <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, either late this year or early next year, it will be soundly defeated at the polls. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* If it has a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> early in the period permitted for this type of <span class="highlight">election</span>- that is, between July and December- it knows that it will be badly beaten. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* If the Government postpones the <span class="highlight">election</span> until later in the first half of next year, which is the latest possible date on which it can hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the retiring half of the Senate, the date for the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> will be brought so close to the date when the House of Representatives is due to go to the electorate that, by virtue of the stupidity of not doing so before, it would be forced to have the House of Representatives go to the electorate at the same time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* I believe that much more important than simultaneous elections is the power of the Senate to refuse Supply or to reject money Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* If that power were taken away there would not be the same need or urgency as there now is for simultaneous elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* In respect of the filling of vacancies, the Government is acting in the way it is now acting for the sole purpose of trying to prevent the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Senator Brown  at the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> because, as the Constitution now stands, it would be necessary for Victoria to elect 6 senators instead of five. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* One thing about the change concerning simultaneous elections that I like is that it will have a disciplinary effect on the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* The Senate will be in a position of knowing that, each time it refuses Supply or whenever it behaves in a way that causes the Government of the day to deem it proper to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the retiring half of the Senate will have to face an <span class="highlight">election</span> as well. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* If not, would the Parliament of Tasmania have the right to appoint as a successor to  Senator Townley  a representative from the party which had the largest number of votes at the <span class="highlight">election</span> at which  Senator Townley  was elected?

* He spoke about the elections next year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* It would not matter at all if the Government called for a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in May next year followed by a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in December. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* Moving on to the question of simultaneous elections, the reasons that elections should be held simultaneously are fairly obvious. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* People tend to become apathetic and if we have too many elections too often there is a tendency for the value of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the public mind to become somewhat debased through apathy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* Originally it appears on a fair reading of the historical position that the elections were designed to be synchronised in any case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* Although I understand the concern of persons who consider that it may be a derogation in some way of the power of the Senate the fact is that it was only a political accident in the early 1960s that removed the synchronisation and prevented simultaneous elections from proceeding as they had for quite some years before the early 1960s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* I do not think that these rumblings will be seen by the people as substantial and I do not think there can be any really substantial argument advanced against the proposal to hold simultaneous elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* One effect of the present proposal will be that there will not be a situation in which one House can force another House to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> without the former itself having to face the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* I would go one step further: I think there is much to be said for federal elections taking place every 4 years in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* In England the normal period is 5 years but often an <span class="highlight">election</span> is called on before that time has expired. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* The American federal experience of 4 years with mid-term 2-year elections seems to work reasonably well. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* Indeed, for the American presidential elections there is a specified day every 4 years upon which the <span class="highlight">election</span> must be held. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* If we are to get long range planning into this country 's affairs, regardless of political matter, in my opinion it would be satisfactory to extend the period of elections to 4 years so that governments are not tempted to indulge in political activity for much of their term of office or act within the constraints of political circumstances most of their time but are able to devote more of their term to those functions of government which would produce a longer range benefit to the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* That would also avoid the costs involved in holding various elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* It is obvious that these 3 Labor members who have spoken today are making a last ditch stand in a vain attempt to influence the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* We all know that in a general <span class="highlight">election</span> the question before the people is who will govern the country for the next period of years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* Those of us who have participated in elections are also aware that in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> people generally, say: Why the hell do we have to go out and vote on Saturday? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* I think that the argumentit is put usually by a minority, but a vocal minoritythat simultaneous elections diminish the power of the Senate, on the one hand is based on opportunism and, on the other, shows an inferiority complex. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* In almost all cases very few political leaders have shown any enthusiasm for single Senate elections at which people have been asked to vote for senators and which do not involve the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* The result has been- the recent Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> indicates this quite clearly- that people tend to vote for those people who put forward a point of view which is attractive but which would not attract their votes if the choice of a government depended on their decision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* In one recent Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> an independent senator was elected from Western Australia on a platform to abolish estate duties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* In Victoria a candidate received 20 per cent of the vote but his Party in a general <span class="highlight">election</span> was able to achieve only between 9 per cent and 12 per cent of the vote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* Another important reason should be advanced in favour of the referendum, namely, that this Parliament has been subject to a continual succession of elections over the years for the Senate and the House of Representatives to the extent that in the last 10 years there has hardly been a year in which some form of <span class="highlight">election</span> for this Parliament has not taken place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* It creates the unfortunate situation in which governments have to plan on a relatively short term basis those policies which may be unpopular because at the end of every year in recent times there has been an <span class="highlight">election</span> or an <span class="highlight">election</span> due early in the following year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* If there were an <span class="highlight">election</span> the vacancy would be filled on a single vacancy basis or would add to the number of vacancies which would normally occur and therefore distort the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* It would not appoint the man who had run in the previous Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and who was nominated by the Party, but a senator from the Labor Party nominated by the Labor Party was ultimately appointed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Labor Party would normally win two out of the five seats in that State in a single vacancy <span class="highlight">election</span> because it is in a minority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* An <span class="highlight">election</span> took place within about 6 months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* It acts to the disadvantage of the Labor Party in this instance because in Victoria at an <span class="highlight">election</span> due 6 senators would be elected, four of whom would be from the Liberal and National Country Parties.

* I suggest that there is no evidence at all, and I hope that the present senators would support me, that they are m any way inferior or constitute in total an inferior Senate than those senators who were elected at single Senate elections in 1964, 1967 and 1970. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* As I said earlier, it is an opportunist argument, an argument designed to inflate egos and in some cases to advantage minorities, not to bring about a proper rational <span class="highlight">election</span> of members to both Houses of this Parliament when the responsibilities of government and choosing government are upon the electors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* For example, in the case of a Labor Party senator changing his Party affiliations, as did many Labor Party members in previous years who joined other parties such as the Democratic Labor Party, we would be courting a dangerous situation if we had to ensure that a casual vacancy was filled by a person of the Party to which the departing senator belonged at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>.

* I do not know the cost of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> but it would be at least as much as a referendum plus of course the many millions of dollars spent by political parties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)

* Two of the better referenda, namely, that relating to simultaneous elections and that relating to electors of the Territories being able to vote on referenda, were mixed up with others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0)
