* The then shadow Minister for Social Security and for a short time the caretaker Minister for Social Security, who is now an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> senator in this place, promised, on behalf of the Government- he has said repeatedly since then that he had the support of both the Liberal and National Country Parties- that pensions would be automatically and immediately indexed to the consumer price index twice yearly and that pensions would be taken out of politics.

* I am conscious that standing here, the youngest person to address this chamber for over six decades, I do so in several capacities: Firstly, as an individual- unique I hope, and if not yet worth cloning, at least worth listening to; secondly, as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who believes that to govern is to serve; thirdly, as a member of a unique chamber; and, finally, as a Liberal.

* Nothing pleases me more than to see ex-activists of the Liberal Party and Labor Party working together amicably and constructively in so many <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> branches because in that process we have a microcosm of a future Australia which operates through the politics of cooperation rather than the present politics which in spite of words to the contrary continue in practice to be confrontative [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44)

* Attractive though it is maybe, for any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> to favour the idea of the people making the decisions, the fact is that it is just no longer possible, if indeed it ever was possible, for the people to be aware of all the factors that are necessary to sensibly determine an issue.

* The success of that policy in Sweden under a social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> government is shown by the fact that that Government has been much better able to withstand the recession that has hit all the Western world countries over the past three or four years.

* It is not the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> view that Australia should indulge in foreign adventurism or that we should involve ourselves extensively in a network of alliances that might attract unfavourable attention to us in time of war; but it is certainly the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> view, and I suggest the view of the citizens of this country, that we should be in a position to defend ourselves.

* I had not intended to rise again on the Bills, but since  Senator Keeffe  has chosen to make an unspecific statement concerning Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> policy in this regard, I feel that I should stress to him and to other honourable senators that the relevant point of Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> policy is very basic to our Party: It is that this country is a multi-racial society and that, within reason, all Australians should share the same privileges and responsibilities.

* Although  Mr Baker  stood as an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> candidate in 1977, the Australian Democrats are not liable for debts incurred by him. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0)

* I believe there is a moral obligation on the Australian Democrats, as a political organisation and as a political party, to honour a debt incurred in terms of material prepared not only for the promotion of  Mr Baker  as a candidate but for the promotion of  Senator Mason,  who gathered together the 6.6 per cent of the votes that he received in the electorate of Paterson, in amassing the total of votes which brought him, as an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>, into this Senate.

* My constituents, who run the Regency Press as a small private concern, accepted the account of  Mr Baker;  they printed the material in good faith, in the belief that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> candidate would honour this account. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0)

* Frankly, they cannot afford to carry a debt of $ 1 ,300, which it appears that the Australian Democrats are not prepared to honour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0)

* In view of these economic factors, will the Government now use its influence to persuade the Government of South Australia to support the recently expressed policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> Legislative Councillor,  Mr Lance  Milne, to mine copper, gold and rare earths at Roxby Downs and to return the uranium ore to the ground as mine fill, as is being done elsewhere in the world?

* His  explanation for having said that the Democrats, whom he expects will hold the balance of power after 1980, will introduce private member's Bills to do three things appears to be that, from the Bills that he proposes to introduce, the sections that actually appropriate the money will be omitted and therefore the Bills will not be disqualified by virtue of section 53 of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41)

* What he is really saying is that the Democrats propose to introduce meaningless Bills as some sort of a political stunt by which they hope to secure support within the country, without delivering the goods that they have promised to deliver.

* Firstly, one Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> vote last night- I think  Senator Chipp  said that there could have been only one <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> vote because  Senator Mason  was sickwould not have affected the outcome of the division and, secondly, no honourable senator can properly blame any other honourable senator for his failure to vote in this place when this is occasioned by his going home to bed before the Senate adjourns.
