### Sample sentences:

* Some recent comments by people who are unfairly opposed to the magnificent work of the National-Liberal coalition Government of Queensland in <span class="highlight">education</span> would convey the impression that the State Government has not maintained the level of its spending on educational services which existed prior to the introduction of the Schools Commission funding scheme.

* I do not think that is a fair comment, but it is a view that is held, in certain circles, of colleges of advanced <span class="highlight">education</span>.

* What requests or suggestions were made at the meetings of the Directors-General of <span class="highlight">Education</span> in Melbourne in November and of the Ministers of <span class="highlight">Education</span> in Melbourne in November and of the Ministers of <span class="highlight">Education</span> in Perth in February for legislative or administrative action by (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the Territories and (c) the States.

* I recall to honourable members opposite that whereas 80 per cent of the children from those schools for whom they speak in the Parliament complete their secondary <span class="highlight">education</span>, only 30 per cent of the children from government and Catholic schools, for which honourable members on this side of the chamber speak, are able so to complete their secondary <span class="highlight">education</span>.

* Everybody, myself included, is particularly enthusiastic to see this college increase in its standing in the community and increase in its standing among people involved in tertiary <span class="highlight">education</span> and among those who would employ its diplomates and future graduates.
