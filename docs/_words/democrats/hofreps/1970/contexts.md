* I compliment the Minister for the Capital Territory on being flexible enough to see that there was a groundswell of opinion in both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party locally and also in the parties that are not represented in this Parliament by people from the Australian Capital Territory- the National Country Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrats</span>- to have the referendum held before Christmas and the election next year.

* The aim of democratic socialists or social <span class="highlight">democrats</span>- honourable members can refer to me in either of those terms- is to make our society freer, fairer and more enterprising and to recognise that enterprise does not have to be solely in the private sector any more than it should be solely in the public sector.
