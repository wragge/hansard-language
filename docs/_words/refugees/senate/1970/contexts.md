* The arrangements for reuniting East Timorese now in Australia with their relatives either in Australia or in East Timor follow from an agreement between the  President  of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Australia that officials of their two countries would meet to resolve the problems of the East Timorese '<span class="highlight">refugees</span>' who had come to Australia without their parents.

* 'families' should be widely interpreted in the terms of the culture and background of the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> concerned rather than according to the normal criteria of Australian immigration procedures- this would involve the acceptance, appropriate to each particular ethnic group, of degrees of what we might describe as extended families '; [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40)
