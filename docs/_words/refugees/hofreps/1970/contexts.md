* If assistance provided by the Government for the survivors of the tragic cyclone last November, which ravaged the off-shore islands and coastal regions of East Pakistan, is any indication of our concern for these people, as only $425,000 was provided, I am not really surprised that only $3m has been provided to date for the relief of Pakistani war <span class="highlight">refugees</span>.

* When I was in West Bengal 2 months ago the Indian Government said that on the assumption the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> would be there for 6 months - it would be a good thing if they could be repatriated after 6 months - the Indian Government would need $600m worth of aid.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* I think it may also have to offer to have United Nations observers, with its army and support forces, to convince the world and the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> that this is its policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* At present, <span class="highlight">refugees</span> are still coming out from East Pakistan at the rate of more than 100,000 a week, many of them fleeing because of the operations of the Indian supported liberation army. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* If India is sincere in its desire to minimise the refugee problem and to get the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> back to their homeland quickly, the Indian Government must withdraw all support from the liberation guerrilla army and discourage its activities so far as this lies within the Government's power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* I have given what I believe is a true picture and one that reflects little credit on either India or Pakistan who have allowed their mutual hatred to override their compassion for the 10 million <span class="highlight">refugees</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* I do not know whether  it  will be possible for anyone  to  induce Pakistan and India to co-operate, but we should continue to do all we can both directly and through the United Nations to achieve whatever is possible, for our overriding aim must be to achieve conditions so that these <span class="highlight">refugees</span> can go home. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* Certainly, it is pitifully inadequate in terms of what is needed, firstly, to keep the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> alive and, secondly, to avoid the complete collapse of the Indian economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* I have with me some figures which were given to a United States Senate subcommittee convened to investigate the problems connected with <span class="highlight">refugees</span> and escapees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* These figures show that the total economic cost to India to support the current 6 million <span class="highlight">refugees</span> for 6 months would range from about $500m to around $820m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* If we extrapolate that to the present figure of 9 million - that is the figure which the Indian Government has given and I see it is the figure which the Australian Government accepts - the cost would be about S750m to perhaps a high estimate of $1230m to sustain the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> for 6 months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* Should we not be doing what the United States Senate sub-committee has done and try to determine what the needs are, precisely what the Indian Government wants and how much it does cost to sustain this enormous number of <span class="highlight">refugees</span> for 6 months, one year or for however long they will be maintained? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* The other point about this figure of $10m or $12.5m, whatever you like, is that it is not just a question of providing more aid because the problems that are imposed by the influx of <span class="highlight">refugees</span> are not entirely economic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* A problem that has been caused by the influx of <span class="highlight">refugees</span> is that a refugee who is already getting a daily supply of rations can virtually go out and offer his services as a labourer for very much less than the going price. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* The resultant downward pressure on wages has caused and I am sure will continue to cause a great deal of friction between the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> and the people of West Bengal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* Another great problem - and this is related to my point that it is not purely a matter of providing funds - is that even before the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> arrived in West Bengal that area was tremendously overcrowded, very largely due to the large number of <span class="highlight">refugees</span> that had come from East Pakistan since partition in 1947. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* Between 1947 and the beginning of this year 5,500,000 <span class="highlight">refugees</span> had come to West Bengal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* Most of the unsettled land up to the time of partition had been settled by an active programme of the Indian Government to try to settle post-partition <span class="highlight">refugees</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* I think that if there is some sort of deal made perhaps between the Awami League and the Government in Islamabad I do not think it would be sufficient to make all the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> go back. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* Even if we can get the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> or most of the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> back into East Pakistan there will still be tremendous problems in resettling them and helping all the war victims, including those people who never went across the border into India in the first place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* We failed to understand the sermons of restraint by the big powers, particularly the Nixon administration, who are supplying the arms to the military junta in West Pakistan and aiding the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> also, though Indian public opinion bore a strong resentment against such a double cross policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* The plight of the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> in many of these camps is indescribable, lt is far worse than any picture or story one has seen or read and unless the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> are quickly dispersed to better camp sites, preferably back to East Pakistan, there will be mortality on an unprecedented scale. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0)

* I hope that on this occasion the Government will allow the amendment to be put to a vote so that honourable members may express their opinions in the same way as the Australian people have already expressed their opinion on the level of aid which is being made available by the Australian Government for the East Pakistan <span class="highlight">refugees</span>.

* I suggest that if any group of administrators or any group taken out of any Parliament in the world were given the job of administering West Bengal without the 9 million <span class="highlight">refugees</span> it would show a complete and total lack of administrative capacity when faced with the problems that exist in that area.

* The sixth point I would like to make is that the development of callous public attitudes to the refugee problem may well cause governments to adopt callous official attitudes to the <span class="highlight">refugees</span> which, in the long term, will have a negative influence on efforts to seek an international solution to the problem.

* We must therefore continue to meet our international obligations and, at the same time, continue to seek solutions at an international level by supporting, for example, the concept of an island processing centre provided by Indonesia and administered by the UNHCR; by placing pressure on the source countries of Indo-China to have a more compassionate and understanding approach to this problem and, hopefully, to remove the causes of this mass exodus; and finally, by persuading other governments to make greater efforts in offering refuge and resettlement to <span class="highlight">refugees</span>.
