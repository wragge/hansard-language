* The unique information provided in the tables on the flow of goods and services in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, together with their ability to show the inter-industry and inter-sector effects of specific changes in economic policy, mean that the tables can be used for national planning of either the directive or indicative type.

* Nevertheless, this has some point when one considers the number of remarks that were made, I think properly, by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in relation to where this money is going, and in particular as to the relative merits of rural, commercial or industrial sectors of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* As was pointed out by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean),  the nucleus of New Guinea's <span class="highlight">economy</span> is agriculture and its ability to import goods and services is, to some degree, dependent - upon its ability to export agricultural products.

* The honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  apart from raising one or two matters which I thought had a hint of party political purpose in them, was interested in discussing the New Guinea <span class="highlight">economy</span> - and he certainly is qualified in this respect - with some objectivity.

* It is first necessary to build the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> to deal effectively with the problem of the cost price squeeze - not merely to have regard to the problem of increasing wages - and to take positive action to deal with all elements which find their way into the cost structure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0)

* The amendments to the Act can be classified under 6 main headings: Firstly, the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, including the structure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the separation of the conciliation and arbitration functions of the Commission, and appeals and references; secondly a strengthening of the sanctions provisions of the Act, including a review of all penalties provided by the Act; thirdly, the regulation of registered organisations established by the Act to ensure more effective democratic control of those organisations, including provisions as to secret ballots in relation to industrial bans and stoppages; fourthly the role of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in dealing with matters of particular significance to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country; fifthly, the amalgamation of organisations; and sixthly, a wide range of other provisions of the Act which are not without their own special importance to the operation of our system of conciliation and arbitration.

* Therefore, the Bil] proposes an amendment of section 39 of the Act to ensure that, when the Commission is constituted to deal with appeals and references and with the reserved matters under the new section 31, it shall, in considering the public interest, have regard in particular to the state of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the likely effects on that <span class="highlight">economy</span> of any award that it might make.

* Because of the special circumstances which I have already mentioned, I believe that it is necessary to examine government charges in all sections of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span>, including those charges on residents in country towns, with the object of easing the burden on those people of rising costs, which in rural industry generally cannot be passed on in the way that they can be passed on in so many other industries.

* I emphasise that Queensland's approach to the Grants Commission was brought about by the financial circumstances in that State, Queensland's <span class="highlight">economy</span> has been very adversely affected by drought conditions and, even though it was justified in making this claim, it might not have made it if it had not been for those particular circumstances.

* However, this other point must be made that any official, whether he be political or whether he be a member of the Public Service, who discusses the matter of the exchange rate is likely to find that the mere discussion of it creates speculation which would be counter-productive to the country's <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* One thing that was highlighted in the document was the sort of devices that are supposedly available, such as exchange control, taxation measures and so on, and how these devices can be frustrated - and this was particularly true in regard to the section on exchange control - by people who come here calling this a host country, but who in essence can become predators on our total <span class="highlight">economy</span> by the way they choose to act, either in terms of the available exchange controls or the taxation laws.

* As to our high level of unemployment, it has resulted from the credit squeeze, the tight money situation and record high interest rate, as they have impacted on the building industry in particular and the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> generally, also from the flood of imports stemming from the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut, plus the very large and unduly prolonged revaluation, and a variety of other measures on which I will not elaborate.

* -Before the time factor interrupted my observations last evening I was proceeding to summarise the lamentable state of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and I was drawing attention to the fact that both by accident and by design the present Labor Government has brought this country to the very edge of national bankruptcy- a contention which is not to be lightly resisted, not even by the wiles, the charm and the determination of the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly).

* So on these 2 key indicators we can see there has been no remarkable effort by this Government- a government which came to power on the basis that the Labor Party could not manage this country and that it would be able to get the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on its feet, turn on the lights and all that sort of thing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* It depends entirely for its success on the consumers of this country deciding to spend more money because by reducing Government expenditure the Government is taking out of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> expenditure on goods and services thereby reducing demand for all the various products which are produced in this country, and the only way in which that cannot lead to higher unemployment and more recession, less economic growth and so on, is for people to start spending more money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* What has been said and what I have said over and over again is simply this: It is an absolute tragedy that Australia's <span class="highlight">economy</span> was so underutilised that the Government, which is now the Opposition, had to plunge this country into a deficit of over $4,000m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1)

* Considering that no significant problems are developing between Australia as an <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the other economies with which we have dealings, on this occasion the Party has asked me to make a specific point to the Minister assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson)  who is at the table, that the Party is completely foursquare behind the proposals which the Government is putting in this respect.

* I want to stress to the Australian people that the key factor in getting this result has been the moderation achieved in the wages-prices merrygoround, the futile process of wages up and then prices up, prices up and then wages up, in a futile attempt to get ahead, and in the process weakening the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and creating- or, as things are now, maintaining- the high and totally unacceptable level of unemployment.

* For instance, if prices rise by 3 per cent then there should be an increase of the order of $3 for the low income earner, but the increase should taper so that a person with an income as high as $30,000 per annum, for whom a 3 per cent increase represents nearly $20 a week, should receive a much lower increase than that in the national interest and in the interest of containing inflation and getting the <span class="highlight">economy</span> moving again.

* That is a very important aspect because if, first of all, the Bureau of Statistics is funded sufficiently to ensure that it can maintain such a research bureau, and, secondly, its forward estimates in regard to what is going to occur in the future are given not only to Treasury but also to our proposed department of planning and to the public generally, we will have a far more healthy <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole.

* If the Government is to approach the problem of a blown-out deficit by cutting real government expenditure it may still be faced with a high Budget deficit but at much lower levels of economic activity, because by cutting the level of government demand it will be pushing the <span class="highlight">economy</span> further into recession thereby reducing receipts and increasing certain expenditure such as the unemployment benefit.

* What I am saying, if the honourable member will allow me to get on and develop the argument, is that if one is to intervene in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> one ought to do it in a rational sort of way so that we know what we are doing rather than having a mish mash of ad hoc decisions and processes which in effect can lead to the misallocation of resources and the dislocation of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> and can in many cases be entirely counterproductive.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* What one must realise is that, as I have indicated and as the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Roger Johnston)  has already acknowledged, there are many instances in which this Government is prepared to intervene in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and therefore necessarily distort the free market processes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Examining both the history of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> or economic experience in comparable economies around the world, we do not believe that the type of policy advocated by the Leader of the Opposition would, at best, provide anything more than a short term reduction in the level of unemployment followed before very long by a revival of inflationary expectations and a consequent increase in the rate of unemployment.

* At the present time Japan is battling to achieve its 6 per cent growth rate, and in order to bring that about the Japanese Government has introduced a Budget providing a 20 per cent increase in public works expenditure because it realises that this is the area where there are high multipliers flowing into all sections of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the area which generates economic growth.

* Let me refer to the 1977-78 annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission to show how a sort of snapping- much as one may snap at irritating flies on a summer day- at policies is not the way to handle sustained economic development or to strengthen in the medium to long term the performance of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* In so doing, it is admitted by those who hold to this argument that the long accepted analysis from Keynesian economics that a deficit increase through reduced taxes or increased government expenditure would have stimulatory effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and conversely that a deficit reduction by tax rises or an expenditure cut would have contractionary effects on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* The Opposition ought to consider this proposition: If a deficit is allowed to increase enormously at the same time as there is promoted a lack of confidence, at the same time as which productivity has become negative and at the same time as which there is an increase in inflation and a rise in interest rates, the circumstances of that deficit could be very damaging to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* This Government recognises that inflation is not particularly important of itself, but it is important because of the flowthrough to all people in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the flowthrough effects on the confidence of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and the flow-through to the working people and the old people.

* -It is a great commentary on the Government that in a major debate on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> it puts up someone with such a deplorable understanding of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Sainsbury).

* The reason we said that this Budget would have a contractionary effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was, taking it on one basis, that the Budget was taking more money out of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> than it was putting back.

* The problem is that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is not even getting the appropriate treatment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0)

* But the people in charge of the treatment of the illnesses of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> suffer from both incompetence and ideological obsessions which frustrate the necessary cures.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0)

* If that is what 'stagflation' is supposed to convey then that does not describe the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0)

* But it is symptomatic of a good deal of loose talk about recession and stagflation among media commentators for example, used almost as a throwaway line, but still serving to spread a false view of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* The next difficulty I would mention is the international outlook, particularly the outlook in the world's most significant <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the United States, where production is declining, where in the six months to September inflation was at the level of 14 per cent and where interest rates are currently 15 per cent and higher.
