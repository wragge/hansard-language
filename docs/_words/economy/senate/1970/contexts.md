* It is correct to say - here I agree with  Senator Rae  - that probably no issue in Tasmania in recent years has caused as much controversy, as much concern and as much alarm among Tasmanians generally as has this decision, and that no decision will have more effect on the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">economy</span> than will this one.

* If the present industrial lawlessness is to continue and costs continually increase not only will primary producers be put out of action altogether but also, to put it mildly, the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will be placed in a very parlous position indeed.

* This means that while the bulk of the community faces rising expectations - I still say that the bulk of the community is affluent but there is an increase in the area of poverty each year and we must concern ourselves with this increase because it can affect the stability of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> - those on social services face the prospect of a continuing fall in their standard of living relative to the rest of the community.

*  I think the best way to approach this Budget is to begin by quoting the concluding remarks of the speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  because it would be refreshing if we did from time to time in the Budget debate address ourselves to the subject of the Budget and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

* These are relevant things to do because 1949-50 was the year of change from what I call the running of a Socialist <span class="highlight">economy</span> to the running of a market <span class="highlight">economy</span> and 1970-71 this is the year in which we are now, so we have a useful bracket of time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

* From 1949-50 to 1970-71 we have had 20 years of market <span class="highlight">economy</span>, Liberal-type government, sound economic growth, great opportunity and great growth in living standards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

* But what I really wanted to say to the Senate, if with the  Deputy  President's help  Senator Georges  will permit me to have a moment of silence, is that we have in this country this year a highly responsible Budget which is giving whatever concessions it is proper to give and which is operating a balanced-Budget <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

* At a time when all members of this Parliament, irrespective of party affiliations, arc concerned about the effect of inflation on our national <span class="highlight">economy</span> it is only natural that a great deal of comment should be made outside the Parliament by the Press and leading economists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

* The fact that the Government is budgeting for a surplus and is prepared to introduce measures to restrain inflation indicates that the Government proposes not to take deflationary action to the point where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will be harmed, but to control inflation as is considered necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

* It has cost the Government a good many millions of dollars each year, but I am quite sure that the returns to the producers and the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and in good times to the Treasury through taxation, have more than paid for the cost of the subsidy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3)

* Despite the recognition of many of the claims made by the Australian Labor Party that Australia is getting into debt very quickly because of our inability to control ownership and overseas interests in this country, and in spite of the recognition obviously given to these matters by the Prime Minister, great burdens are being placed on the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

* As I see it, that was the prime condition which the Government had to take into consideration when preparing its Budget; but it was not the only condition, lt had to decide its expenditure and its taxation requirements in the light of the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

* Nevertheless in expressing those views which are not deeply researched but merely an expression of opinion which one hears I think the Government did acknowledge the condition of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and recognise that it was one of the backgrounds in respect of which its Budget had to be implemented. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

* In other words, what is now necessary is a complete examination of the structure and infrastructure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> to find at what points and by which reorganisation the matter can be approached and investigated to see that the national wealth is accumulated and developed as quickly as possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

* As the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> has always traditionally provided a great part of our national wealth and is today threatened with a diminishing role in this respect, this problem particularly has to be handled not only in the economic and human interests of the people concerned, but because obviously resources in that field of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> are not being used to best advantage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

* I simply direct the attention of honourable senators to the fact that the propositions which we advance are really related to the structure of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that if those items are handled properly the Parliament and the country will not be faced with the position with which they are faced in this Budget. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

* Honourable senators will note that most of the propositions in our amendment are positive in context and penetrate to the fundamentals of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> - fundamentals such as defence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

* Again that is part of this method of attacking the whole infrastructure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, ft is not possible to consider a matter of such consequence as pensions in modern Australia merely by a periodic review of pensions by Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

* The means test, of course, is ancillary to that and again goes to the issue of the fundamental Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> because it goes to the issue of the conservation of resources, to the building up of savings and to the use of investment capital. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

* Paragraphs (8) and (9) are practical propositions on the nature and structure of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> which, if properly handled, will be reflected in the finances of the Budget and will enable the Budget to become a real and vital document from year to year, gradually advancing the conditions of the people, gradually enriching their lives and gradually extending their opportunities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-14-0)

* My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and it relates to the statements by the Prime Minister and other Ministers including himself about the inflationary trends in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in which very strong criticism of wage increases was made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0)

* In view of the Government's stated policy of cooling down the overheated <span class="highlight">economy</span>, can he inform the Parliament whether the Government has any plans to declare hire purchase companies hanking institutions? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-21-0)

* The net result is that the apparent conclusion reached is that, provided adequate provision is made for re-hearing if necessary, the method of service provided for in the proposed amendment is the best method to be adopted in the interests of efficacy, <span class="highlight">economy</span> and convenience. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47)

* Well, with an <span class="highlight">economy</span> of language but with an absolute simplicity and clarity and purpose, the Minister has justified these provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47)

* There is an <span class="highlight">economy</span> drive at present to help control the inflation that is current in the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0)

* As the Government suggests that it is seriously concerned with the rising rate of inflation, although I cannot see how, with an expanding <span class="highlight">economy</span> with full employment, an increasing population wilh an increasing demand for consumer goods and a population with little or no desire to work and of spendthrift habits in excessive gambling, drinking and smoking, we can avoid inflationary pressures, 1 simply ask the Prime Minister: Will he and his Government give serious and favourable consideration to bringing in a Bill to reduce parliamentary salaries by 10 per cent or lake steps to reduce other allowances by 20 per cent? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-3-0)

* What flows from it is the restraint which it will encourage, the example which it will set in the community at large in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">economy</span>, and the benefit it will bring to the housewife and, in fact, to everybody who is confronted with the problem of inflation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0)

* Will the Minister get a report on the situation with a view to inaugurating a plan to preserve this important part of Tasmania's <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to ensure that this section of the wool industry does not fade out? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-25-0)

* The allowance was one of a series of measures designed to stimulate demand and restore confidence in the future growth of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and was particularly directed to encouraging expenditures on equipment and re-equipment of manufacturing industries which were then at a low ebb. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0)

* If the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  wishes to launch an <span class="highlight">economy</span> campaign he could cut down the staff of the Public Service by half and save $2m straight away. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0)

* Very often our good friends from other parts of Australia do not properly understand the economic condition of the sugar industry and the role it plays in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0)

* I am sure that our good friends in other parts of Australia are conscious of the great role the sugar industry is playing in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in general, and in the settlement and the maintenance of settlement over the continent of Australia.

* Therefore, if it becomes a matter of the preservation of a major industry such as this - and it is responsible for the settlement of a large area, of the continent of Australia - Australia will have to be regarded as what might be called a single industry <span class="highlight">economy</span>, just as Cuba is regarded in that sense.

* In view of the deep concern of wide sections of the Australian public about current trends in the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, will the Minister endeavour to prevail upon his colleague the Treasurer to make a detailed and comprehensive statement to the Parliament on the present state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and thereby provide much needed reassurance to the Australian community that the difficulties being encountered over wide sections of national endeavour are not as serious as they appear to be?

* I would add for my own part that I believe there is a ready acceptance all over Australia and throughout the world that the price of wool is very low and represents a very serious threat to our wool industry and to the whole of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> which has a relationship with that industry.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0)

* Subject to the approval of all governments concerned, this extension of the affinity group scheme will come into effect on 1st April and will provide for eligible passengers, for example, a Sydney to London return fare of $730.70 compared with the full <span class="highlight">economy</span> rate of $1,304.80. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0)

* But having looked at the effects of this legislation and examined the principle of this taxation concession in the generality and in its effect on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> I am highly doubtful whether we should have contemplated the legislation in the first place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0)

* To suggest that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country will be improved by the elimination of the allowance for depreciation in calculating assessable income is, in my view, to advocate the ridiculous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0)

* If we are to keep a buoyant <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to give encouragement to those who are prepared to lay out capital in order to keep modern and competitive I hope that the word 'suspension' is real when it is applied to this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0)

* I am hoping that in this period this company which has control of practically all the sales of this commodity in this country will be able to claim that through the assistance the Government has given it in the past it is possible for the company lo produce competitively a commodity which contributes to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country without the assistance of bounty.

* That is why our Party has always said that unless the whole structure of the rural <span class="highlight">economy</span> is closely examined and is given a new look in the light of our approach to the new world, we will continue to have these crises and the Parliament will continually be asked to try to retrieve a desperate situation and to succour the dying rural industries.

* Nevertheless, in recognition of the special difficulty confronting minimum wage earners, the Commonwealth, while opposing any increase in the total wage, in its recent national wage submission said that it did not set its face against any increase in the minimum wage but added that any increase should not be of a magnitude which would have serious repercussions on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or which would spark off agitation for the increase in total wage rates to restore relativities.

* First of all I want to say that it is evident to me that what is involved in the matter of industrial relations in a situation where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is rapidly expanding and where inflation has taken over and is rising very sharply every year is the ability or non-ability of trade unions to secure for their members that to which they are rightly entitled, that is, their share of the wage increases which flow from national wage cases or determinations made outside the arbitration tribunals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0)

* On the domestic side, the Tariff Board's report will be valuable in enabling the Government to make an assessment of the scope for early action to achieve cost savings in the domestic <span class="highlight">economy</span> without causing injury to Australian industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0)

* However, there are other forces and influences outside the immediate area of where wage rates are established which bear heavily on standards of living; that is, the decisions of the Commonwealth Government in relation to the management or mismanagement of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* So it follows that, if the national <span class="highlight">economy</span> is mismanaged and the purchasing power of the dollar paid in wages is eroded, organised labor - be it public servants or others - has no alternative but to press claims to do nothing more than merely retain or at least restore the purchasing value of the former wage paid.

* I must comment that it seems remarkable that the suggestions which we put and which were unacceptable to the Government only last August, after there has been a period of restriction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> which caused unemployment figures to rise and which created a sense of instability throughout the whole of industry, are suddenly acceptable and the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has suddenly become flush enough for the Government to be able to afford to do the things that we suggested were within the compass of the national expenditure last August. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0)

* Perhaps some of the other steps that the Government took to control inflation, such as a reduction in interest rates, may be proving more effective than trying to impoverish and draw back the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a restrictive measure.

* As I have said to the Government time and again - we think it has been shown by the trend that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> has taken - one of the major causes of inflation was the medicine that the Government was pouring into the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-33-0)

* We have said that the policies that have been pursued by the Government of allowing into Australia uncontrolled and untrammelled capital for the purpose of taking over Australian enterprises would damage our internal <span class="highlight">economy</span>, would militate against our overseas trading situation and could deleteriously affect, if not destroy, Australian characteristics and our very identity.

* It also suggests as guidelines that could be useful to other national governments the introduction of a screening process via a government agency with the power to negotiate for better performance from foreign direct investors and with the power to block investment that does not make a net contribution to the nation's <span class="highlight">economy</span> or that does not accord with government objectives.

* When he talks of the problem of unemployment, which, as I say, was the central theme of the discussions that took place on 14th February 1972, he said in relation to being consistent with our objective of maintaining steady growth in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that we should maintain a high level of employment.

* In this statement, as always when the Prime Minister makes statements, great emphasis is placed upon the factor of wages in relation to the control of the national <span class="highlight">economy</span>, but it is significant that the Prime Minister gives scant regard to the factors upon which wages are based, that is, the costs of goods and services in the community.

* I am sure that the representatives of the Commonwealth Government here would agree that it is right that a government - in the case of Australia, one government - has to accept this responsibility, because to carve it up amongst the States of the Commonwealth diversifies the control of the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> into so many hands that it is not a cohesive whole and inevitably must run into trouble. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Commonwealth Government has control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and exercises its capacity to influence, if not to control completely, the policy of the Reserve Bank, which enables it to control the credit resources and the lending facilities of the nation as well as the interest rates which will apply throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0)

* Indeed, it is possible, by the infusion of finance into the various projects carried out in Australia through the State governments, to exert pressures on the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by releasing extra spending power or, if the Commonwealth Government feels that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is getting out of hand, by decreasing spending power.

* We all recognise that, but what puzzles me whenever Bills of this nature are before the Senate is the patronising attitude the Government adopts towards the sovereign States of the Commonwealth which have sacrificed their own taxing rights to the Commonwealth in the interests of the sane and sensible management of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* I can appreciate that an economic problem did develop in non-metropolitan areas in this country in the last few years when it was necessary for the Federal Government, which manages the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to take specific steps to counter a set of economic circumstances over which it had little or no control.

* I maintain that if the Commonwealth is responsible for the control of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the nation, as we have agreed, and if a set of circumstances arises where we have escalating wage costs brought about by escalating prices and escalating demand, then the Commonwealth has some direct responsibility for the economic circumstances which brings about those things.

* What was adequate in the circumstances prior to 1970-71 is completely inadequate now because of the existing levels of prices and wages in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> that the Commonwealth is managing in 1971-72.

* If those commitments are aggravated by circumstances in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> over which the Commonwealth has no control or circumstances over which the Commonwealth does have control, it is not an act of generosity by the Commonwealth to do what has to be done; it is a practical necessity for the whole of Australia.

* I am not advocating that course; 1 am merely pointing out that if a proper inquiry reveals that there is the genuine unemployment that some figures seem to indicate, there arc now many ways and means available to the Government which it has not had in some circumstances in the past when the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the country was unable to sustain employment.

* We merely point out at this point of time, without expressing any opinion at all, that the evidence should be collated and that it should be considered in making a decision on a national level, first of all, as to whether there should be any alleviation of the customs duty normally paid in this area and, secondly, as to whether there should be governmental action to see that any contracts of this character have some Australian content included in them in the interests of the whole of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* It is said that because the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this nation, except for the pressing needs of inflation, is still buoyant and is still maintaining a level of employment, and because the general level of prosperity of the whole community is probably equal to, if not better than that existing in almost any other country, everything is all right and we have no more need to plan, to take precautions, to worry or to doubt that in the next 5 to 1.0 years of challenge we will be just as successful.

* This sort of measure is a necessary corollary to a reserve or central bank situation in a nation like Australia- a country with a sophisticated <span class="highlight">economy</span> which is developing rather fast and which, although it is not large, as a trader and a country of economic consequence has a position in the world scene higher than its population might otherwise justify and is more subject to the problems of world trade and world monetary movements than are many other countries whose production does not pass into world trade to anything like the same extent.

* When we read the extremely accurate economic assessment of the Honourable Frank Crean we must wonder whether the accuracy of his economic attitude and his knowledge of economic theory and of the things that make an <span class="highlight">economy</span> work could be the reason that he is unfortunately very shortly to cease to be the Treasurer.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0)

* It seemed also to reveal to me that whilst the Federal Treasurer had indicated a very fine concern for the realities of economic theory in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>, this concern was to be contrasted against that of the incoming Treasurer who may be more concerned, as I believe much of the taxation material is concerned, with matters which are basically ideological rather than economic and social. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0)

* It is significant indeed that the Treasurer should have made such a statement, for we are constantly being reminded that the inflationary tragedy in our <span class="highlight">economy</span> is a world wide disease, and the presumption is that it is contagious and that in Australia 's case it is an imported situation.

* Everyone will accept that a normal measure of risk taking is the proper and natural province of a free enterprise society, but I am sure that everyone will agree that the sort of inflationary risk taking with which the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> is faced today is most definitely incapable of being solved by the best managerial skills here or anywhere.

* There has to be instilled into this <span class="highlight">economy</span>- I suggest that one of the most important ways that this sort of thing can be instilled into the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is through taxation measures- a confidence and a determination to increase productivity across the board; in other words, to increase the size of the national cake instead of spending our energies on dividing it in different ways and leaving its size the same perhaps as it was or even smaller.

* I could go on but, as I support the amendment moved by  Senator Carrick,  I choose to say in closing my remarks that the tragedy of the Bills we have been discussing is that they are totally designed- I regret to say designed but I assume that is the correct word-to deny incentive at a time when this <span class="highlight">economy</span> and this society needs nothing more and certainly nothing more urgently.

* Because 95 per cent of our wool is sold overseas and only 5 per cent of it at the most is used locally the industry has always been in a position in which it has been dependent upon the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the purchasing countries and has always been in difficulty in Australia because of the high cost structure at home.

* One can go right back to the period after the Second World War and follow through the basic wage cases, the margins cases and the national wage cases which took the place of basic wage cases, and one will find that in every one ofthe decisions in those cases the Commission has been asked by the Government and by the parties, be they employers or unions, to have regard to the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* It would seem to me to be important, indeed imperative, that a government as the ultimate organiser and co-ordinator of an <span class="highlight">economy</span> should have the right, indeed the obligation, to seek that any results and any recommendations of these tribunals, where considered necessary, should be referred to the full bench. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* This legislation will lead to the greater possibility, perhaps even the probability, of responsible compromise in this field of industrial relations which, as I said when I started to speak this afternoon, is probably more basic to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and consequently to the whole of Australian society than any other single matter.

* They need to get their state of understanding and their state of confidence from a confident <span class="highlight">economy</span> and a well run <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that in due course they will say 'Everybody regards this as the fact', not 'Everybody regards this as a matter for argument for difference of opinion, and a matter on which we ought generally to be chopping each other about'.

* The economic growth that is now occurring and the reinvestment that is now occurring will, in due course, produce the solutions to those problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> with which we are confronted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* We asked the IAC to consider particularly in its future reports the method and level of tariff and other assistance necessary to protect industry against import competition; whether industry could be made more efficient; the basis forjudging that efficiency; the possible improvements in it; the level of tariff assistance that this would require; whether restructuring was called for; if so, how this could be done; whether industry was less efficient than it could be due to fragmentation, insufficient specialisation or restrictions; and the consequences to the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to the social fabric and to employment of changing the levels of tariff assistance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* What we try to do in the White Paper is to say what will be the broad shape of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, how its employment characteristics will move, how we will look to maximise the opportunities of the people of Australia, what the best way is to look after those people and to help them to do the best possible job for themselves and their country, what should be our balance of trade position and the balance of local opportunity, how we should best add value to the natural raw materials we find or grow them in the ground, and how to maximise the opportunities for the Australian people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* They rely to a very great extent on the public sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, on the construction of roads, bridges, railway lines, railway carriages and rolling stock, pipelines and sewerage lines, all of which construction has been cut seriously as a direct result of this Government's policies.

* So all in all we have a situation in which the Government, firstly, had to find out what sort of a mess the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in and, secondly, had to devise policies to remedy it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* May I finish my remarks by again pointing out to the Senate that although this motion of itself is of no value, I am glad to have been able to speak to it and to give people an opportunity to understand what the Government has been able to achieve during its relatively short period in office in the area of manufacturing industry and, in fact, in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a whole. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* It was quite obvious to anybody who read between the lines that there was a fundamental brawl going on, not only in the Government Parties but also in the bureaucracy, on the vexed question of tariff policy which is at the heart of the future not only of manufacturing industry in this country but also of our entire <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* The manufacturing industry has further been hampered by bad working conditions, by its small scale- its smallness on the domestic market- and the Jackson Committee pointed out that there has been needless duplication of plant, there has not been any of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of scale and it must become internationally competitive and become an exporter so that it can burst out of the straitjacket of the constricted local market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* In this regard I do not think that anybody can possibly query the claim that the Government's main responsibility regarding the <span class="highlight">economy</span> at present is to deal with inflation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* If we were to provide Government measures that would give a great impetus to business at the moment out of balance to and failing to recognise the needs of the rest of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, we would suffer again the worst surges of inflation as we did in 1974-75.

* Its failure to produce a report on manufacturing industry, and its failure to achieve any worthwhile success on the state of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in relation to wages and prices is an indication of its inability to develop properly an alternative strategy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* I suggest that the inability of this Government to make any fundamental review of the nature of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the problems besetting manufacturing industry and the divisions that therefore exist within the Government are the reasons why the report on manufacturing industry has not yet been dealt with and placed before the Australian Parliament and the Australian community for a public debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0)

* I know we must look forward and not backwards to any great extent but I only wish that the previous Government in 1972 had thought about establishing a committee to give it a bit of advice on the realities of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and on the need to give assistance to industry rather than leaving it until 1974 when, as I have just shown from the figures I have cited, the damage was done.

* At a time when the whole of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> is going through some very painful adjustment processes, especially in the motor vehicle industry and at a time when industrial disputes have been reduced substantially, the action by General Motors is not to be treated lightly.

* A new investment of at least $370m has been announced in the last 12 months, including an investment of $150m by General MotorsHolden 's and we are due to see more announcements of new investment in the future from people who obviously are prepared to back themselves down the long haul as this country's <span class="highlight">economy</span> gets better and better, as it certainly will.

* If what is expected is that everybody be guaranteed by the Government to do well all the time in respect of everything they do, I do not think we would have a free market <span class="highlight">economy</span> at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0)

* There is a prospect that in due course from this position, by creating a stable base in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to ensure growth again and by getting cost competitiveness back into the scene through the investment programs and general restraints, we will get back into the export market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0)

* But it will best be resolved in an <span class="highlight">economy</span> that is stable and growing, and with a cost structure in the industry which is realistic so that Australia can get back on its feet and once again have a bigger market, much of which will have to be in exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0)

* I find myself in complete agreement with an increasing number of spokesmen of farm organisations who believe that the future of agriculture in Australia depends upon a prosperous domestic market, recognising as they do that about 50 per cent of all that we produce is consumed on the domestic market and that any downturn in any sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> therefore affects the prosperity not only of the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> but the rural sector in particular.

* So we see that the Premier, who on 28 February stated that unless more money was obtained many major projects of vital importance to the State's <span class="highlight">economy</span> and development would have to be deferred or slowed down, concluded a deal to spend less and then had the audacity to claim that as a victory.

* I think most of us v/ould be very pleased that finally the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has come clean with the Australian community and has admitted what has been said by the Labor movement for a considerable period about the problems of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and about the fact that we have reached a stage in our development where unemployment, particularly amongst young people, has become, and will remain for a considerable period, a permanent pan of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* Some are even prepared to blame the Press for highlighting things which, they say, create difficulties in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and they blame a lack of confidence by those who seek to invest.

* Let us look at the extent of the penetration of transnational corporations into the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> and at the startling dimensions of some of these transnational corporations which have already been set up in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0)

* Australia's gross domestic product in 1976-77 was some $82,224m but some of the transnational corporations are larger than this in these terms and combined, of course, they completely dwarf the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0)

* The sheer magnitude and percentage of such key economic aggregates accounted for by the transnational corporations gives some indication of the influence that these corporations' decisions have with regard to investment and capital movements and what they mean to the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, to the economic policies of this Government or, for that matter, any other government, to the monetary and fiscal situation, to the exchange rate, to the balance of payments and to the size and direction of investment.

* We know that that is true in your State of New South Wales,  Mr Deputy President,  in South Australia and particularly in Victoria where the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the State is dependent upon the efficiency, maintenance and healthiness of a particular industry.

* But rather than undertake technological adaptation and produce a plant and a process that was dovetailed to the needs and the situation of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in most cases they merely installed a scaled-down version of the existing overseas plants or they took the other step of underutilisation of production.

* I think that this Government, the Parliament and honourable senators opposite should put that view out of their thinking- the problems are more fundamental than that and mere repetition of rhetoric goes nowhere towards the solution of the more fundamental problems with which we are confronted- if in fact they are genuinely concerned, and I suggest that many honourable senators opposite are, with the problems concerning the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, the lack of job opportunities and the permanence that now seems to be part of the unemployment scene in this country.

* I refer to the extent to which foreign owned companies are able to determine the direction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, are able to determine in what areas investment funds should be placed, are able to determine whether companies will expand and are able to determine whether jobs will disappear for all time from very important sections of the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* The problem, of course, is how to prevent inflation through wage pressure from over powerful unions as the <span class="highlight">economy</span> reaches full employment, thus wrecking everything that has been carefully built up.

* The degree to which the present Budget is anti-inflationary and to which inflation could fall further is entirely dependent upon the <span class="highlight">economy</span> being driven deeper into depression, as it will be.

* There have been the changes to economic circumstances occasioned by international factors- the oil price rise, the problems of weakening international trade, the ever-deepening penetration of our <span class="highlight">economy</span> by major international corporations, the degree of inflation which was triggered off to pay for the involvement of the Western world in wars in the Asian region.

* In fact the Government has no policy which will create more jobs; it has no policy upon which the Australian community can be encouraged to spend; and it has no policy upon which one can see any development of growth in the private sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* Mr Dunstan  went on to make some comments about what the Prime Minister had done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, comments which my natural modesty and sensitivity to the delicate sensibilities of Government senators prevent me from repeating in this chamber.

* Some Government senators will recall what  Mr Dunstan  had to say about what the present Prime Minister had done to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country, but I will not repeat that here. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44)

* Because of the slow growth in world trade we cannot look to resurgence in general overseas trade and markets to lift our <span class="highlight">economy</span> and thus increase employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44)

* I believe it is time for the Government, as part of its examination of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and as part of its responsibility to our near South East Asian neighbours, to have research carried out, in Treasury, trade, employment and other areas, into the feasibility of an extended South East Asia Pacific community with common economic, trade and defence policies.

* However, no doubt the impact of other government measures in relation to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> will have an even greater effect on the success of Australian tourism insofar as inflation will be reduced and therefore the costs incurred by people travelling to and within parts of Australia will be reduced and opportunities will flow from people being able to spend their money more easily.

* The resounding swing in that by-election and also the landslide victory in the State election in New South Wales show clearly that the people of Australia are disillusioned by the string of broken promises and the inability of this Government to put the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back on the road to recovery.

* Although that large sum of money will also have to be repaid at least it will be used to develop wealth in the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> in exactly the same way as the proposed $4,000m loan of the Labor Government in 1974 was intended to do.

* At the same time, the increased unemployment benefit payable and other commitments mean that any government has to be assured of obtaining adequate revenue without lumping the burden of tax on to a section of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> or the community which cannot afford to pay it or which is unequally bearing the burden.

* My real fear is that, combined with other measures adopted by this Government, the tax surcharge, which may have to remain for at least two years even though the Government has said that it will be imposed for only one year if the <span class="highlight">economy</span> does not recover, will have an actual and psychological impact on consumer confidence and will comprise the worst Christmas present the Fraser Government has given the Australian people yet.

* The reason why the deficit has increased and the tax cuts had to be imposed were as I have given them before in the Senate, and they were eloquently summarised by a former Liberal member of the Victorian Government when he said that  Mr Fraser  had ruined the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the building industry.

* I think that there are benefits for the development of our rural areas, which is the development of our whole nation and whole <span class="highlight">economy</span>, in allowing people or giving them particular incentives to involve themselves in investment in primary production areas, even if they are not fulltime primary producers, regardless of whether their reason for not being fulltime primary producers is one of choice or one of necessity, as has been the case with many of our beef producers, particularly in Queensland although I think probably also in Western Australia in recent times.

* The Government said that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was in such a state that we would have to develop the private sector and that to do this we would have to develop consumer demand.- Yet, this' very strategy is negated by the five Bills that we are considering because $5 60m will be taken out of the hands of the consuming public, particularly out of the hands of those to whom payasyouearn taxation applies, at a time when the Government states that private sector activity is part of its aim.

* I can well remember stating last November that if the Government pursued its policy of unreasonable contraction of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and blind faith in the reduction of the deficit pensions would inevitably suffer and the indexation of pensions twice yearly would go.

* That was borne out in no uncertain terms, firstly, by the results of the Werriwa byelection and, secondly, by the results of the New South Wales State election held about eight or nine days ago when the Fraser Government got a massive rebuff for the way in which it was handling the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of this country and for its treatment not only of the States but of the people in need.

* Wage and salary earners, not only in their capacity as earners but also in their capacity as consumers, will be unprotected and left high and dry as a result of the inept attitude taken by the Government in this statement which will have the effect of strengthening the big business sector in our <span class="highlight">economy</span>.

* It is related to a problem which involves us all throughout the whole community, that is what can be done to ensure that an economic policy can be pursued which will reduce inflation to a level which is manageable so that the <span class="highlight">economy</span> can be brought out of the period of recession which world economies have experienced and into a position of growth whereby growth in the ABC and various other areas will then be able to take place.

* It was also recognised that the position of individual countries varied considerably, and that if we were to succeed in steering the OECD <span class="highlight">economy</span> along this so-called 'narrow path' some countries would need to concentrate primarily on bringing inflation under control, while others would carry a particular responsibility for maintaining the momentum of the recovery.

* I would like to sum up my contribution to this debate by saying that it is acknowledged that the ABC, any more than anybody else in the community, has not had it easy over the past two or three years while this attempt to bring the <span class="highlight">economy</span> back under control and get it going in the right direction has been taking place.

* If we wish to give incentives to <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the use of drugs and hospitalisation- as we surely should- the Minister should provide that health maintenance organisations should receive, for each contributor the average amount spent per head of the community by the Government on drugs and private hospital care.

* I remind the people of Australia that in that period inflation rose to 18 per cent, interest rates soared to unprecedented heights, the short term lending market was in a desperate situation, the whole <span class="highlight">economy</span> was overheated and the primary producers, along with others, had enormous difficulties because of basic costs in getting their goods onto world markets.

* If we compare the percentages of the work force which have been involved in the various sectors, we find that in 1 950-5 1 rural industry accounted for 14 per cent of the work force whereas in 1977 the percentage had dropped to 6.4 per cent; the mining industry accounted for 2 per cent of the work force in 1950-5 1 but the percentage had dropped to 1.3 per cent in 1977; manufacturing industry accounted for 29 per cent of the work force in 1 950-5 1 but in 1 977 the percentage had dropped to 21.6 per cent, a drop of about one-quarter on the 1950 figure which is a very significant change in the light of the very great growth that has occurred in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and the manufacturing sector since the end of World War II.

* When we consider the forces that are working to move jobs from one sector to another, it is quite clear that while there has been a very significant period of boom in those 25 years when viewed in the longer term, there have been very great changes with people moving from one sector to another upon incentives that have occurred more or less naturally in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> as a result of increasing profits in one sector as against another and increasing developments brought about by definite government policy; for instance, the encouragement of development in regional areas, in sections of States and indeed in some States as against others.

* It is pretty fair to say that had the recession not occurred and had the Australian <span class="highlight">economy</span> remained as buoyant as it was in the 1960s and early 1970s very little would have been heard of the problem of structural change.

* Suffice it to say that, during that discussion, the point was made that change in manufacturing industry in Australia was necessary, albeit on a gradual basis and after having established a firm foundation for the <span class="highlight">economy</span> so that significant changes can occur with the least possible social and economic disruption.

* In contrast, this Government has now borrowed more than $3,500m overseas and there is a likelihood that if there is no real recovery in the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, that sum could become $5,000m within the next 18 months.

* That is a pertinent interjection because I was about to say that in the 1948 case before the Arbitration Court, when the unions argued for a reduction in the working week from 44 hours to 40 hours, those very arguments were put forward- that the costs would be so great that the country's <span class="highlight">economy</span> would be sent broke.

* It might be recalled by honourable senators that last evening when I was speaking on the Budget I was endeavouring to make the point that the Budget has to be seen as only one of the instruments which determine the level of economic activity in this country, but in fact it has a limited influence on the course which the <span class="highlight">economy</span> takes.

* I made the point that in the operation of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of a modern industrial society the real basic decisions about growth, development, the course the <span class="highlight">economy</span> should follow and the creation of jobs depend largely on decisions which are made privately and not publicly- decisions which are made by major corporations on whether they shall invest here or there, whether their capital will leave this country and go off-shore to Asia, or whether the building of steel mills, oil exploration or other major projects will be undertaken by those owners of capital.

* As a consequence, the Budgets which have been characteristic of the Fraser Administration, including the current Budget which is a Howard-Fraser Budget, can be described only as class Budgets insofar as they seek to take in taxation from the common pool of income in Australia a greater proportion from the pockets of the wage earners and to redistribute that money in the form of incentives for big business or the big corporate sector of our <span class="highlight">economy</span>.
