* While there may be a very small incentive contained in this Bill, the fact that the charges by and large fall on people who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, may just be one extra factor- I will not make much of it- which will encourage people to think about the advantages of taking out Australian citizenship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0)
