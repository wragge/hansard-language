### Sample sentences:

* We became the guests of the Portuguese authorities who had begun the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, preparing the people for the act of self-determination and for independence.

* It was further agreed that there should, 'at the earliest possible time', be a 'meeting between Portugal and all the political parties of Portuguese Timor' aimed at 'ending armed strife and bringing about a peaceful and orderly process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>'.

* Nonetheless, the Government understands that Portugal is to make an attempt to retrieve some lost ground by sending a negotiating team with a view to persuading Fretilin and UDT to stop fighting and to agree to negotiate new arrangements among the Timorese parties for orderly <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>.

* It reflects, above all, the immaturity of Timor's own aspiring political leaders, who in less than eighteen months have succeeded in wrecking Portugal's <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> program, sharply polarising political opinions through the territory, and finally plunging the territory into violent civil war.

* Australia is not a party principal to the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Portuguese Timor but it is concerned that in that process the best interests of the people of the territory should be of paramount consideration, and Australia has always acted with that viewpoint in mind.
