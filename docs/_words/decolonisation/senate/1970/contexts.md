* I do not believe that it would be helpful to comment further at this stage on what is obviously a delicate and difficult situation, beyond saying that it remains the Government's strong hope that the political forces in the territory can compose their differences to the extent that they can co-operate peacefully in its further <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0)

* It is in this situation of drift, of Fretilin's refusal to accept that UDT or Apodeti has anything further to contribute to the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process, and of Portugal 's regrettable inability to reassert its authority in the territory, that we view the various policy pronouncements, newspaper reports and the like from Jakarta and Timor itself.

* 
 Senator Sir Magnus Cormack, in relation to South Africa, has failed to understand that the United Nations, by an overwhelming majority and in many cases by votes in excess of ninety with a small number of countries abstaining and with one or two countries in opposition- often countries like Spain- called upon the rest of the United Nations organisation to assist in <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and in the movement for independence in Africa.

* But I must say that undoubtedly Australia and particularly the Cocos-Malay community should be indebted to the '<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>' Committee of the United Nations- the Committee of TwentyFourwhich went to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in November 1974 at the invitation of the then Labor Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* I think that each June the Australian Government has had to report to the '<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>' Committee on the steps that it was taking to achieve political and social reform for these people.
