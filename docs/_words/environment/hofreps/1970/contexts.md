* In speaking to the estimates now before the Committee, I intend to confine my remarks to a subject which in my opinion is receiving very little, if any, real attention from the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24)

* I shall not deal at length with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and Aborigines beyond saying in the context of my particular thesis - the development of an Australian identity - that nothing could redound more to the advantage of our national image than, firstly, that we should succeed in dealing humanely and intelligently with the problem of promoting the happiness of and establishing a satisfactory relationship with our Aboriginals - 'the first Australians.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24)

* Although it is a new Department which when it was set up came under some criticism as being a miscellaneous sort of department, there is no doubt that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has under his control some very important facets of the national life and some very important responsibilities that the Commonwealth has to meet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24)

* When we consider the expenditure of Commonwealth money and where it is being spent we find that it is spent mainly on Aborigines who live in towns, and that the largest amounts of money spent have been on Aborigines other than those living in a fringe dwelling <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

* What I can say is that if anyone knew the full story relating to the VIP incident, rather than being critical of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, he would say that he took upon himself an enormous responsibility when there was no need for him to have taken any responsibility whatsoever.

* Within those years I have realised that the people of the world have become increasingly conscious of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live and are attempting to ensure that it is a healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> for themselves and future generations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38)

* Within the last 20 to 25 years the progress in industry and communications and the increase in the number of city dwellers have created a situation in which man has to take a quick, serious look at the environmental problems which he has created and is still creating and which have certainly been to bis own detriment.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38)

* But when one sees the evidence of the dangers that are created by pollution in a closely settled city which has been allowed to grow haphazardly - and this is what has happened in every major city in Australia - with no thought at all having been given to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, this argument becomes so much rubbish. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38)

* As I said before we have the areas in which this development can take place; we now have a Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts; the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Howson)  is currently the Minister at the table. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38)

* So, I believe that a case has been fully established for an examination of this important area of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, for the simple reason that the greatest number of people in this country will be affected by environmental changes in that particular area.

* Therefore, despite all the problems of the countryside - and there are some in relation to agriculture and pesticide use and that sort of thing - the fact is that the quality of urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the direction in which it is moving is the outstanding problem which remains for this or any other government in Australia to take on.

* I have had an opportunity to study the way in which Federal and State systems relating to environmental matters have been adopted in places throughout the world, but I have not studied it in great depth because the time has not been available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29)

* Secondly - and the honourable member for Dawson did mention this point - the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the wool is grown has a very large influence on the type of wool produced, and whether in fact sheep of a particular strain can survive is often determined by the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live.

* The purpose of tonight's statement then is to define the strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> which, in the view of the Government, is most likely to exist during this decade and could potentially exist in the 1980s; to describe how in general we believe Australian defence capabilities should be shaped in accordance with the responsibilities of an independent country; to make clear the Government's policy of strengthening and not withdrawing from our international defence associations; to describe the burdens and the gains and the clear balance of national advantage which we believe flow from these associations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0)

* It aims as well to remind the House of some of the perils which will arise if any Australian Government should flout our commitments or jeopardise confidence in our word or our endurance, or seek refuge from contemporary burdens by reducing the country's defence capabilities and retreating from a military role in helping to maintain the security of the external <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which Australia is destined for all time to live.

* But it is, I believe, an essential ingredient of Australian diplomacy that Australia should be understood to be a country whose security interests are growing; whose population and wealth are growing; and whose determination to take some part in shaping the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live is more lively than ever now that the great western powers have served notice that their involvement in lesser situations is not to be taken for granted.

* What can be achieved by a defence programme giving us the ability to project Australian armed strength beyond our continental shores is twofold: It will give future governments options to have some influence on events in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> so that we may contribute to the greater security of all countries in that area.

* I might mention at this stage that a great deal of credit for the success of Canberra - a success which was recently acknowledged at the United Nations Conference on Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in Stockholm - is attributable to the work of  Sir John  Overall as head of the National Capital Development Commission.

* Clearly the concept of such a department held by the Government is very limited and out of date and if I asked honourable members to state the first couple of items which came to their minds when I mentioned the word '<span class="highlight">environment</span>', we could see what part of the problem is.

* Guidelines which the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> can lay down are sets of rules which define environmentally-wise ways of doing anything; of building dams or roads or a new town; cleaning land, managing city air, planting forests, building and siting industries, designing transportation and maintaining natural ecosystems to allow evolution to continue, or managing our arid interior or our precious coastline, or harvesting wood, mining and exporting minerals, generating power or viewing the population policy, and many others.

* He has not got so far as to put 2 and 2 together and realise that this is absolutely the best means of achieving the reverse of his first objective* Perhaps some time he and the people who help him with these matters will put the whole thing together and decide whether they are going to go for balanced development so that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is seen in the perspective of economy and vice versa, or whether they are going to keep them absolutely separate and therefore almost totally meaningless. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55)

* We are well aware that the initial attempts of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to enlist the cooperation of the States in a national intrusion, as it were, into this field were not universally acclaimed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55)

* I suppose it is fair to say now that the much criticised, in some ways, impact statements are in fact a very considerable move in the direction of a national framework for environmental awareness and action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55)

* We have, in simple terms, the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> which involves things like air pollution, water pollution, perhaps the consequences of over-population, depletion of resources and matters of that kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55)

* On the other hand, we have the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which aesthetics, interpretations, perception and the quality of life in a general sense are more likely to be involved, although both these facets-the physical and the social - add up to the quality of life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55)

* However, I would just say that it is a very interesting fact that whereas the Labor Party has been saying for a very long time that all the ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation problems of Australia should be compounded into a responsibility of one monstrous, huge centralised organisation here in Canberra, this has never been, and never will be, I am sure, the policy of the Liberal-Country Party Government.

* I do so in some ways to rebut what the previous  speaker  the honourable member for Cook  (Mr Dobie)  just said, in that he has taken the concept of the Opposition as one of an overall structure dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> rather than an overall concept of what a Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> means and what it should deal with.

* In examining the functions of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, I am afraid that its functions are far too nebulous and that they do not give us any clear guidelines as to what we are determining.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Although in the past a number of people have been concerned about the relationship between man and his <span class="highlight">environment</span>, about the utilisation and conservation of scarce resources, about the preservation of unique natural land forms and the conservation of the earth's flora and fauna, only recently has this concern become widespread amongst the people of the developed countries of the world.

* In the past we have emphasised quantitative growth at the expense of qualitative growth; the failure to attempt to assess environmental effects when undertaking new developments; neglecting to account for the social costs of pollution; the increasing dependence on conveniences such as the car without due regard for the environmental effects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* To develop a new consciousness towards the problem of living in harmony with our <span class="highlight">environment</span> we need new knowledge, new attitudes new insights, not only through all levels of government - and here I would like to place special emphasis on the role of local government which has particular responsibilities particularly in city areas - but in the private sector as well, in the protessions, in industry of course, right through to the individual citizens themselves.

* All this leads to my second warning, and this ls specifically directed at those who see the cause of our problems as being the growth economy and the onward march of science and technology and who advocate as a cure the restriction or abolition of our dependence on technology, the cutting bask of an economy based on growth and the introduction of extremely harsh environmental legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Firstly, as I have said already, the economy and environmental action are irretrievably intertwined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* If there is no expansion of output within the economy roughly equivalent to the cost of cleaning up the <span class="highlight">environment</span> then, of course, that cost can be met only by cutting down on other sectors of the Budget. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* The only way out of the dilemma, is to expand the economy, with its consequent risks to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Not to do so is to invite the slowing down or stopping of environmental action as a result of the backlash I have referred to. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Secondly, we must realise that cleaning up the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will need the development and application of costly technology. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Thirdly, it has often been suggested that harsh legislation should be introduced as the means whereby those polluting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be made to pay and pay dearly for their sins. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* What is required is cooperative incentive based legislation, aimed at encouraging manufacturers to adopt new and worthwhile pollution methods aimed at encouraging individuals to keep in mind their effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Punitive laws have to be enforced if they are to have any effect, and in an area as widespread as environmental control the sheer size of the law enforcing agency necessary is frightening. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* If, however, both companies and individuals secured worthwhile rewards - and this would almost automatically have to be economic - for acceptable environmental actions, the chances of widespread co-operation would be greater.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Perhaps one of the most significant national developments during the 1960s was the widespread realisation by the public that the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live is declining, that the air and waters around us are becoming increasingly polluted and that much of the land upon which more and more of us live, is becoming increasingly congested with mounting burdens of waste disposal and with growing social problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Another factor which is becoming an increasing problem in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> is the population increase throughout the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Therefore, I think it is of extreme importance to our future generations that we as a people do something to conserve our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, whether we do it individually or collectively. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* We must learn that the conservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> must be a joint venture between man and nature if we are to hand our country and our way of life over to future generations in good order and condition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* The challenge of preserving this <span class="highlight">environment</span> may well become one of man's greatest tasks in the near future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* It is not a matter of ecology and <span class="highlight">environment</span> versus development, but rather of ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Therefore we should think in terms of ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* I have taken part in this debate today merely to sound the warning that it is not <span class="highlight">environment</span> versus development; rather it is ecology, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and development.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* The various piecemeal activities of several government departments must be lumped together so that the environmental policy reflects the <span class="highlight">environment</span> itself - a whole and integrated system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* 1 say to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  that we have an opportunity here to do likewise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* Both stressed the need for balance in environmental considerations and said that we must balance the needs of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> against the needs of the economy and try to see that the two march hand in hand together. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* They were not saying that there must be economic growth and that there must be care of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but rather that the two can be made to co-operate and not to fight against one another. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* The Government, through the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, has established the means by which we can see that we do get this balance not only in relation to matters which are the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth but also in relation to those which are the responsibility of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* I am glad to see that as a result of the announcement by both the Commonwealth Government and State governments of the polluter pay' principle that industry is cooperating with governments in seeking solutions to <span class="highlight">environment</span> and pollution problems and that the governments and industry are working together to find better solutions than they have had in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28)

* There is .also the danger that the courses we provide are- much too sophisticated for the kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which these young people are to operate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Very early in its term of office the Western Australian Government established an environmental protection authority, and the Government has consistently acted on the basis of its recommendations even where, as in the postponement of the Pacminex refinery project, they were in conflict with other basic Government aims. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30)

* The 2 variables are: At what stage economic take-off occurs and how quickly that stage can be reached if enough money is infused into that local regional <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0)

* It is easy for all of us in this Parliament and for members of State parliaments to say that we will build a magnificent concept of a new city, that we will develop a new region, that we will start where there are few people - perhaps 10,000 - and try by capital infusion to turn the area into the sort of <span class="highlight">environment</span> where people will be most fulfilled and happy in the years to come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0)

* In addition, we should do something to ease the older generation out of agriculture - and the abolition of the means test is of considerable significance here, with the property component so far adding to the immobility of older people in agriculture - and allow them to move into a nearby rural community where socially they are happier and they are still in their own <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

* Recently we have had much talk about decentralisation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> - this new found love that the Government has - but why did it not apply some of these principles when it brought forward these proposals?

* These include improving the efficiency with which the community's productive resources are used - this involves the making of an economic judgment concerning the prospects of success for an industry and surely that should be within the compass of government and not within the compass of an outside commission as should be matters relating to the maintenance of an appropriate standard of living and full employment - facilitating adjustment to changes in the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> and recognising the interests of consumers and consuming interests likely to be affected by measures.

* The small percentage of national revenue allocated to the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation by this the first Labor Budget in 24 years indicates that these two important facets of modern living are treated just as nice sounding rhetoric and not as matters of fact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* It was rather amusing to hear the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  talk of the niggardly appropriation for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation because,  Mr Deputy Chairman,  you are no doubt aware that in 1972-73 the appropriation for the Department was $778,700, the actual expenditure was $760,215 and yet the appropriation for this year is $1,729,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I think that the honourable member for Darling Downs should read the Appropriation Bill and perhaps reflect on the years of neglect of this field when there was simply the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation; it had not been brought up to the rank of a full department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I think that the honourable member would be generous enough to admit that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is going through a building-up period and is steadily defining the functions it will serve as far as Australia is concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* It is going to be rather important in the future that we should be clear on the functions of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation because I note that the initial funding of this project was done through the Department of Science or through the Australian Minister for Science. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I hope that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will sum up the present position of the Botany Bay project when he is making his closing remarks because it would seem that the results that will be obtained from that will have a great deal of application to many other areas in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Too often, of course, the questions of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation are overshadowed by the question of wildlife conservation, or the term might even be 'preservation'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I wonder whether the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is giving any attention to this aspect, because if we are to think of this third alternative it is quite obvious that we must have a look at what regulatory devices we put into the system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Only in this way will the most important source of urban environmental pollution in any case be satisfactorily tackled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I know that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has indicated in another paper his interest in this matter of water supply, water resources research and water resources determination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* This is one of the problems that is predominant in Australia because of the relatively dry <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the arid nature of a lot of the area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* There are many other environmental matters on which I would like to speak. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I think that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has got off to a very good start in this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I will certainly not endeavour to attack the Government on the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I, like previous speakers, have no desire to attack the Government on this issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I believe that more money, thought and action must be devoted to the conservation of our forests and our water resources and to protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is most important from every point of view. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* The <span class="highlight">environment</span> and, in particular, the countryside hold resources capable of many uses for agriculture and forestry, for water catchment purposes, for mineral workings, for settlement and, increasingly, for outdoor recreation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* At the same time the rural <span class="highlight">environment</span> is valued in a less tangible way for the culture and history of its community, for its wildlife, for the beauty of landscapes and, in some areas, for its remoteness. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Environmental conservation is therefore concerned both with the quantity and quality of many different resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* This problem can be eradicated by putting some more muscle into pollution control and by giving the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation more finance to enable him to work in co-operation with the States so that this dreadful raw sewage is stopped from entering our coast and desecrating the lovely beaches about which I have spoken. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* The honourable member for McKellar  (Mr Wentworth)  said that pollution and environmental control has mainly been in the hands of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* This is true but I feel that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will agree that we should be using our best endeavours to co-operate with the States to do whatever we can to improve our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to eliminate pollution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Tonight while debating the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation I wish to say something about the effect of cities and urban development on the quality of the air. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Most spectacular among the effects of the city upon the atmosopheric <span class="highlight">environment</span> are those caused by air pollution . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* However, because we have an international responsibility for the protection of the global atmosphere, the Australian Government has in its platform on <span class="highlight">environment</span> a clause stating that it is the responsibility of the Australian Government to show leadership in co-ordinating measures designed to monitor the level of air pollution and to develop programs to protect the quality of air in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* We are at the present time debating the estimates relating to the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* He spoke of his concern about the environmental effect - particularly with reference to water - on the development of a new reservoir in the State of Victoria. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I urge the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to act as the Government's conscience and as the nation's conscience to make sure that we do not develop urban areas out of political whims - building castles in the sky - and seek to place them at locations which seem attractive for political purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* When analysed in the calmer atmosphere that should prevail in a department such as that headed by the Minister, we should, if we find there are risks of an environmental nature which cause us to question politically made decisions, be strong enough to be outspoken and to have those decisions changed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* In this debate many of the speakers have drawn attention to the significant - though I still suggest small - increase in the Australian Government's financial allocation in respect of its concern and responsibility for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Where are the resources whereby governments - State, Australian or local - can be funded to enable them to buy other areas of environmental significance? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I, like other honourable members and concerned people, am worried that very often in debates such as this we talk a lot about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and create the illusion that a great deal is being done when in fact little is being done and that which is being achieved is often being achieved in a crisis atmosphere; where large sums of money are needed to save something in respect of which the public conscience cries out that it should be saved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Then we find that the resources of the nation are spent in saving something which, if the public had been alerted previously, could have been saved at a fraction of the cost and the balance of the money used for saving that environmental resource could have been spent in preserving other significant assets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I gained an inspiration to say something on this very important question affecting the nation and particularly to advert to the Labor Party's determination to challenge the erosion of the country as the result of polluting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Public alarm throughout the nation to my mind in the last decade has reached an all-time high on the question of pollution and the interest in the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* But in my view it needs to go a lot higher to truly awaken the Australian community as a whole as to the need to stir governments, both State and Federal, and the need to protect the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> for future generations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I believe that it is a pity that we never had a government, State or Federal, with the interest in conservation and preservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> that my Government has shown in this very important subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* Because we have not protected the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* The fatness of people's purses became more important to them than the preservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* The present Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and the Whitlam Administration are taking the most positive determined steps by the creation of the very ministry which the distinguished Minister holds to arouse even more the Australian people's need to support the Government and the Department which is determined to protect the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* In my electorate of Hunter, of course, our greatest problem with the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> is coal dust from inferior coal that burns in chitter dumps for years and years once a fire is started by spontaneous combustion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* If it is not economical for the mining companies to curb or prevent this nuisance, 1 believe that our Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will sympathically consider subsidising steps to alleviate the worst of these nuisances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I am very proud of my Government, the Whitlam administration, for setting up a Ministry aimed at preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* This awakened the minds of people and they went on to think about the destruction of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of man. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* I know that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  could not do so out of the amount that his Department has been allocated this year but obviously this point will arise again later. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* In my view the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation ultimately will become a most important and integral part of our future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34)

* In this way too I can see a future for this Australian Government in its role of protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation in that the Department will provide the expertise and the funds to help the smaller shires and also councils in the suburbs of the cities to provide this necessary means of disposing of their waste.

* Also, it is no coincidence that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Control,  Mr Beale,  was sacked from that office because of his ineptitude in looking after conservation matters as they affect the welfare of the New South Wales people.

* The Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  cannot move until he has his regions all worked out; the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  is tying up any decisions he may make with the Minister for Urban and Regional Development; and so it goes on.

* A very interesting range of subjects will be financed by this money: Firstly, as to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the wheat is grown - namely, the soil itself - moisture, organic matter, nitrogen content, microbiology and nutrients within the soil which are required for the adequate production of wheat.

* The Committee is concerned at the length of time the matter has been discussed, the cost and the number of reports which have been produced on various aspects of Ayers Rock-Mount Olga National Park development, and is concerned that immediate action should be taken to initiate measures to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and improve the appearance of the Park while making adequate provision for tourism and for meaningful Aboriginal involvement at every level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24)

* The rapid rise of tourists to the Park, the fragile nature of the arid <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the present management practices adopted have all led to great pressures on the area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24)

* We applaud this modern day approach to this problem of treating these people initially in their homes where no embarrassment is felt and where, through the participation of the whole of the family in the healthy <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is created, the patient can probably readjust himself and overcome his problem, whether it be an inability to cope, a problem with drink or a problem with drugs.

* There has been a great tendency overseas in the training of nurses, for example, to shift from the traditional tertiary training of nurses - if we consider it tertiary training, and I do - in hospitals to the double stream where some of the nurses are trained totally in the hospital <span class="highlight">environment</span> and others are trained in a degree course in the particular nursing subject.

* I ask the Government just to do its sums, do a little bit of arithmetic and it will see that the loss to the Treasury about which it is talking will be quite miniscule compared with the money it is spending, and in many cases spending very rightly, on improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* But I do ask the Government to consider whether there ought not to be some type of option of capitalisation available to the victim of such an accident because one of the additional tragedies of a person who suffers such a permanent accident as that is that he is so often forced out of his own family <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

* We can hardly blame the Department of Northern Development for this, because when one looks at the responsibilities of the various Ministers one finds that the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  has all the say in meat and wool production, the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  has all the say in regard to the mining industry, the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  has all the say in regard to our road system in the north, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has most of the say in this area, and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  no doubt has most of the say in any development projects which may be proposed for the north.

* I would like to put to the Government for considerationI do not say this in any critical sense- the proposition that an examination might be made of our social services to see whether it is possible to give some incentive to families to care to a much greater extent for the elderly members of their families in their own home environments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27)

* But there is no doubt that the caring of elderly people within their own family <span class="highlight">environment</span> is socially, and I think in the long run also economically, beneficial. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27)

* The whole philosophy behind the provision was to give a bit of assistance and incentive to those in the community who were prepared to undertake care of the elderly in their family, their close relatives, within their own home <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

* I would hope that perhaps as an interim measure the Government might give some consideration to the extension of the domiciliary allowance and the removal of the limit of 65 years or over where a person has been the victim of an accident and is being cared for in his or her own family <span class="highlight">environment</span> by close relatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27)

* I think in a number of Scandinavian countries some financial incentives through the taxation mechanism are given to persons who are caring for the elderly within their own family <span class="highlight">environment</span> and have had to make extensions to the home to care for these people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27)

* But I would hope that this Government and successive governments of this country will give in the provision of social services much greater emphasis to the creation of circumstances in which people will have incentives to care for the elderly within their own <span class="highlight">environment</span> and accordingly I hope that the emphasis of our social service provisions will be altered.

* I am in total agreement with him that the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> is undoubtedly the ideal one, but with so many families now in small homes and so many parents working it is not feasible for a large number of elderly people to live with their relatives, and therefore we desperately need homes for the aged where they can retain independence and nursing homes for those who are no longer able to care for themselves.

* Having looked after elderly parents in the home <span class="highlight">environment</span> myself I am well aware of how necessary it is for those who want to care for their elderly people at home to have somewhere to take them so that the younger people can have a day or a weekend off or a holiday.

* While I have no doubt that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation who is sitting at the table would, in fact, as a matter of course demand that an environmental impact assessment be provided with regard to any operations that may be contemplated within a reserve or a national park another may not.

* It is the thinking of many well informed environmentalists around the world that it is probably better to allow mining to take place where there is mineralisation and where it may be considered to be in the national interest provided the mining is undertaken according to very strict guidelines and under the codes of the plans of management.

* However, before any consideration is given to the possibility of mining I think it should be mandatory that those who are going to take part in the mining exercise, whether it be done by the proposed Petroleum and Minerals Authority, by private enterprise or in association with an authority of the Australian Government, should undertake an environmental impact assessment to ascertain the likely effect upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> within that park and the area adjacent thereto.

* I am sure that the Federal Minister is in a position to allay the fears of all the State Ministers and the State governments through the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council by indicating to them that the purpose of this Bill is not necessarily to intrude into their decision making processes but to ensure that in all decisions that are taken, where Commonwealth funds are expended, the dimension of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is taken into account according to procedures that are generally agreed to between the Australian Government and the State governments.

* Recently the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  announced that assistance to the value of about $5,000 to $6,000 would be given to a woman at Ferntree Gully to fight against quarry operations which were allegedly despoiling the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and encroaching onto the communal rights of nearby residents.

* The interpretation was that the Australian Government interfered in areas outside its concern and it sided with the woman and the environmentalists, whereas the facts were that after the woman had established that she had a  prima facie  case against the quarry company she required legal assistance, to take her case to the court.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* I believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, in enabling reports like this to be prepared and in assisting residents of areas to get information that they can put before government departments, is doing a great service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* I believe it is too simple to accept the impression that concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> now is so widespread that the battle, at least in principle, has been won; that it is just a matter of sorting out the details; that we are not in fact in an area of political dispute, as the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  put it to us earlier. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* As Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, as one of what he called the colourful figures passing him by, I think I can say with confidence, and in the hope that I have not yet passed him by, that <span class="highlight">environment</span> is one of our most highly contentious areas and as a result one of our most political areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* That arises simply from the fact that environmental questions come up so often on the basis of competing interests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* That is the sort of field in which anyone with the responsibility for <span class="highlight">environment</span> finds himself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* Finally let me say this to honourable members as I believe it will be of interest to them: A great deal of the work of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is a bit like the iceberg with only a small amount of it appearing above the surface. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* -In rising to speak on the appropriations for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I wish to direct my remarks to the sum of $315,000 set aside for the costs associated with public hearings held as part of the preparation of environmental impact statements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* The expenditure is quite necessary if the full intentions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act are to be achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* It is essential that the public be involved if forward planning and successful protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are to be achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* The environmental impact statement approach goes a long way towards achieving this end. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* The planning and <span class="highlight">environment</span> Ministers in the Hamer Government,  Mr Hunt  and  Mr Borthwick,  have come under partly unjustified attack to the point where  Mr Hunt  was forced in exasperation to say: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* For example, in similar terms to the platform of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party's own platform provides for 'recognition that effective and sensible land use planning is essential to provide for orderly development, preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and maintain and enhance the quality of life '. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* Of course, the Australian Government would require an environmental impact statement on programs which involve expenditure of Australian Government money- that is, where the money is identifiable as being Australian Government funds. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* An environmental impact study would need to take into account many factors, including the impact of the proposal on the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the flora and fauna, and man made materials. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* It would need to take into account also the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> such as health, employment, safety, the community, recreation and privacy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* If the publication of such an environmental impact statement resulted in public comments which questioned whether the proposal had been considered adequately, then the Minister could call for a public inquiry to follow, although I suspect, and it is expected, that only a small proportion of such statements would result in public inquiries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* The Australian Government is anxious that people be encouraged to participate fully in decisions which affect their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* Accordingly, finance is being provided to <span class="highlight">environment</span> centres and conservation organisations to enable them to co-ordinate the activities of community groups. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* Local government had cooperated with the State Government to bring about the re-organisation of the quarry operations in the Dandenongs also to minimise the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* Both parties thought that their plan was the best one to minimise the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* It is extremely important that that sort of assistance be given by the Australian Government and that environmental impact studies and public inquiries be carried out if all people in the community are to have their rights observed and the community rights observed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* I welcome this opportunity to speak on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, particularly because yesterday the Australian Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> published a report dealing with coastal land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* The results may form the basis of an environmental impact study if the proposal for a highway is to be taken further. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* It has a responsibility to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected, to make its own assessment and judgment on whether or not this area of land, unique as it is within metropolitan Perth, should be preserved as it is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* Therefore, both from a personal and a political interest, I think it is of great national importance that this report of the Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has been brought down, advocating as it does a national coastal protection policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* I certainly trust that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Mr Berinson)  and his Department will take the recommendations of this Committee into account. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* I think it is very important that a department working in an area such as <span class="highlight">environment</span> should constantly adjust and not become too rigid because we are dealing very much with an area concerned with value judgments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* I think that one of the most important pieces of legislation introduced into the House in the current Parliament was that relating to environmental impact statements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* Many environmental impact statements are now under way and I foresee that in the future there may be some need to look at the way that these measures have worked out in practice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* The House of Representatives Standing Committee has enabled the members of it in particular to assess the way that people involved in the conservation movement, from the Department down to individuals, are thinking and developing their thoughts on all matters concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the way that the Government can involve itself at all levels in the problem.

* One of the areas under the control of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is that relating to impact statements on the acquisition or use of land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* An environmental impact statement issued on the land in that area has shown that it is environmentally not practicable or desirable that homes should be built in these areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* But I think that as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> he has an indirect responsibility. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* I would like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who is at the table, to take note of this matter because these people are in need of assistance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38)

* One of the other more startling actions of this Government in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and a matter which is indirectly related to the subject of the debate today, was its high-handed action in directing  Mr Justice  Fox to complete the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry by May this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* It is my opinion that this Government not only does not have any commitment to the preservation and improvement of the natural and built <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also does not even understand the most important environmental Act it has to administer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* The enactment of this legislation by the Whitlam Labor Government is the only example of formalising environmental assessment requirements into statuterequirements that most Australians want followed, not ignored.

* It has not been done even though I am informed that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development had many questions to ask British Airways if its final <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statement did not satisfactorily dispel many major doubts raised by concerned Australians such as the Society for Social Responsibility in Science. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* Setting this aspect aside, the wider consequences on the global <span class="highlight">environment</span> have been well canvassed in enquiries in other countries and at this time I do not believe that further knowledge would be gained by traversing these issues again in an Australian environmental enquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* Next, in section 6 it is indicated that, in order to fulfil this requirement to examine fully and take into account environmental effects, certain administrative procedures must be followed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* In regard to road <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Authority staff and interested bodies would have had access to off-road facilities which would have enabled comprehensive testing under controlled conditions of such things as breakaway poles, guard railing and crash barriers which would yield on impact and reduce the likelihood of injury to vehicle occupants.

* Nevertheless, I wish to make this point: Towards the end of last year the position had arisen in consultation between the Department of Defence and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> where my Government was about to make an approach to the governments of New South Wales and Western Australia, to consult them about the environmental aspects of nuclear powered ships- in this case nuclear powered allied warships- visiting their ports.

* A number of people may refute this but I think the findings of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee clearly illustrate that a sterile <span class="highlight">environment</span> is produced by the planting of many of these trees.

* The Government has referred a number of factors contained in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the softwood forestry agreements for examination by bodies which previously had a preconceived view of the matter in that they had prepared material for the Forwood Conference and, indeed, had given evidence before the Committee.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is a matter for caution because of the involved nature of forestry, and because of the difficulty in divorcing from a consideration of softwood forests consideration of hardwood forests, the preservation of native forest and many natural features of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0)

* We saw an end to ad hockery and the beginning of a rational and national approach to so many problems- the problems of urban life, manufacturing industry and education, the immense problems faced by Aboriginal people, the inadequacies of childhood services and health care delivery services, the conservation of our natural and built <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the development of our natural resources and the upgrading and bringing into the twentieth century of our international relations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0)

* That cannot necessarily be translated into the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> in exactly the same terms but there is a range of things which are often meant by people when they talk about worker participation.

* A project which may attract a grant or loan moneys under this Bill would include 'the conservation of water resources or water <span class="highlight">environment</span>' and 'the management of water quality'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0)

* It must be appreciated that over much of Australia rainfall is highly variable both seasonally and from year to year and that floods and droughts are characteristic of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0)

* All our water resources- rivers, streams, lakes and aquifersand the ecosystems associated with them, must be managed in a way which as far as possible will provide overall enhancement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0)

* Furthermore, the management strategies adopted for Australia's inland waters must give full consideration to the effects on estuarine and marine environments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0)

* Hence it is particularly appropriate in the case of water resources projects that they are planned and assessed not only on the basis of the extent to which they influence economic growth, but also on the basis of their impact on social well being, on regional development, and on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally.

 -Mr Deputy Speaker, I again speak briefly, this time in respect to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0)

* I trust that the new Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)-  I will have grace enough to congratulate him on his appointment- will find some pleasure in his association with the Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0)

* If these committees come into being, we will not be able to rise at the start of a new parliamentary session and deal with subject matter committees such as the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the Standing Committee on Road Safety, the Standing Committee on Tourism and the others without giving some consideration to the overall picture. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0)

* I am an enthusiast of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0)

* But if we take a proper look at the committee system it may well be that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation Committee and some of the other subject matter committees may have to disappear as entities and that the subject matter they examine be covered by some other committees so that the most important matters in a wide variety of fields can be dealt with by members of this Parliament in the limited time they have available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0)

* It should also be required to give attention to the reasons for its de-emphasis upon the Government's desire, as expressed in the Act to 'facilitate adjustment to changes in the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, by the industries and people affected by such changes' and to give attention to the wisdom of its apparent rejection of any government intervention in the economy which is not general and not market-orientated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0)

* The more we care for the deprived, the more we think about the problems confronting Australian manufacturing industry, the more we confront the hardships faced by the rural community, the more we grapple with the major issues concerning the <span class="highlight">environment</span> the more we realise the need for increased government intervention on behalf of the community.

* The report found that the special branch kept files on people active in almost any progressive force in the State; from peace movements to the women's movement and to conservationists simply trying to save the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0)

* Although the time in which to prepare for this debate was very limited one would not need a great deal of practice to demolish the attitude of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0)

* The new agreement will also encourage the States to give additional attention to the environmental aspects of public housing, such as urban renewal, provision of open space, landscaping and community facilities.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32)

* Perhaps even more seriously is the ever escalating tendency for cities and living environments to be shaped by the private motor vehicle. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32)

* During the post-war period in Australia and in other comparable countries governments have been goaded by the powerful financial, industrial and automobile association lobby groups to spend almost unlimited funds on roads and other improvements designed to promote without limit the use of a motorised vehicle for every transport task, no matter how inappropriate or no matter what the cost to the non-user or to the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32)

* The most dramatic example of the imbalance of priorities which has been characteristic of Australian transport planning has been the attempts made in almost every Australian city to construct urban freeways, a form which is intrinsically alien to the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

* Unfortunately, the present Government, as in so many other areas, has allowed the Environmental Protection Act to be watered down so that we now have the absurd situation in Victoria where in my own electorate in the City of Heidelberg in respect of the Bell Street-Banksia Street connection, the construction authority is carrying out its own impact studies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0)

* The F1 9 or Eastern Freeway experience totally makes nonsense of this Government's commitment to devolution, to asserting the rights of local government and to conserving the social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0)

* The situation is that the unions, by heavy handed blackmail tactics, are forcing themselves on major employers who are being forced to buckle under because the employers cannot afford, in the competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the building industry, to close down the job for a protracted period while litigation takes place.

* The third factor which ought to be looked at in the light of our amendment is the question of environmental conditions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0)

* At least in the previous Bills some attention was paid to environmental considerations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0)

* In this regard I refer to the 1975 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts of 1967 and 1972.

* With the wisdom of Solomon, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation recommended at that time that the next softwood forestry agreements legislation should cover a period of 10 years- that was not accepted by the Government- with interest accruing from the commencement of the loan and with deferment of the payments of instalments of principle and interest for 15 years.

* In fact, it is a Bill of little substance because it states that the Commonwealth Government, for this next five years, will not be involved in some of the matters it was during the previous five years because of a very good consensus with the States and because of advice received from people such as the honourable member for Scullin in his capacity, some time ago, as the  chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation.

* Following the presentation of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation when the honourable member for Sculling was its  chairman  and also a very detailed report entitled  The Australian Softwoods Products Industry  by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, it has been discovered that the earlier projections over-estimated the demand and that at this stage this excess demand will not be required.

* I think it is generally believed that those people probably should have first preference in terms of some minor detriment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as distinct perhaps from the softwood industry which, if it creates problems for our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is in a better position to be cut back, probably in favour of native hardwoods.

* I would like an opportunity to say that in my view the people employed in the Forestry Commission who manage the softwood plantations and the hardwood plantations in my electorate are the true conservationists who, in their dealings with both the softwood and the hardwood <span class="highlight">environment</span>, have always been very careful in their management techniques to take account of any environmental factors that they find could be detrimental.

* Without trying to expand the debate outside the softwood area, but keeping to the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I want to refer to the woodchipping industry on the South Coast, which has created a lot of heartburning in some sections, especially to some people in the Australian Capital Territory who have created a great deal of protest.

* In my view- I have to admit that I do not have a degree in biology, but I have a great interest in the welfare of my electorate- the present regeneration of our native forests is being very well managed, especially in the area of wildlife and some of the areas mentioned in the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation.

* As I mentioned during the cognate debate at the second reading stage, the Supervising Scientist will not be able to let the members of the public know, through the Parliament, of his communications with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development during the period prior to the tabling of his report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35)

* As the Minister said when introducing the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which is designed to establish an office of a supervising scientist, a co-ordinating committee and a research institute for the region, it is the co-ordinating committee which will be the focal point of the system proposed by the Government for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of uranium mining operations in the region.

* Whilst the three Bills are truly environmental and deal with different aspects, it seems to me that the content of the two groups I mentioned is somewhat different. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  commented that the Bill will enable governments to ensure that the nuclear industry in Australia is so regulated as to afford the utmost protection to the people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* This Bill, in comparison with related Bills such as the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, clearly shows that there is a direct intrusion into local Northern Territory matters whereas the latter Bill largely equates the position of the Territory with that of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Bill envisages that the national Director will have a central role in the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in the enforcement of environmental controls, whether relating to uranium mining or not, in the area comprised in the national park or in any conservation zone, pending the extension of the national park. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0)

* I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  to consider accepting our proposed amendment in that spirit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36)

* I refer, for example, to the question of penalties for a supervising scientist who discloses a matter that he discovers in the course of his supervisory duties, which was dealt with in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36)

* -It seems to me that this is an occasion on which it would be appropriate for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  to inform honourable members of the Government's position, which seems to have changed since this Bill was introduced as a result of the reactions of the Premiers of the various States as communicated to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* It is of little wonder that the State governments are denouncing this package of legislation, particularly the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill abrogates responsibility for the actual administration of these Codes to the States, but it does not spell out how they should perform their duties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* I would have thought that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  as a distinguished lawyer, would be fully aware of that point. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* We are talking about the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, and it is the preparation of the codes provided for in that Bill that is important. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* That is why it is called the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* I agree with the view expressed first by the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Cadman),  and more or less reiterated in part by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  that ideally there ought to be uniform codes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* I join issue with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  in terms of his view that it is an appropriate form of consultation for the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to make a general statement in the House, then for legislation of this sort to be introduced in the way in which it has been introduced, with copies being supplied for the States, and then for the Government to move from that position. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* It also happens to be a fact that in my own State, whatever its imperfections, there is <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation on the statute book that goes further than anything the Government has contemplated in this legislation, and indeed further than any environmental Commonwealth statute. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* I was merely pointing out that I believe that one of the main reasons why the States are concerned about this legislation is that what will ultimately happen to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a result of long term waste disposal in Australia has not been properly thought through. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* I agree with the honourable member for Marybyrnong  (Dr Cass)-  I have not seen all the alternative codes and I have not seen the final Code proposed by the Government- when he said that the likelihood is that we will get better <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection nuclear codes from a Federal government than we will from individual State governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37)

* Reading sub-section 10 in the context of the object there, if the Territory or the State have reserved or dedicated land for those purposes, I respectfully agree with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  that it is npt unreasonable for the Commonwealth to say that it will not acquire land without first consulting the State or Territory and that it will acquire land only after it has the consent of the State or Territory.

* The whole essence of the Government's claims was that it would provide strong, tough codes of practice so that Australians- people who were working in  the mining industry, people who were living near mining operations, Aborigines and people who were in any way affected by the transportation of yellowcake- would be carefully covered so that both their health, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, would not be impaired in any way.

* I can understand why the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  who is sitting at the table, did not choose to speak in bringing down these amendments because if one looks at his speech on 10 April, which is reported at page 1297 of  Hansard - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Clause 11(1) states, in effect, that where the Governor-General says that the laws of a particular State or Territory are not adequate to provide for nuclear codes for <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection then the Governor-General- in other words the Commonwealth Governmentshould take the lead and should provide for the imposition of codes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* I shall quote from my own speech:  1 agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)-  when he said that the likelihood is that we will get better <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection nuclear codes from a Federal government than we will from individual State governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* It may be that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has greater concepts than this Committee had about this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* It was so ravenous in its attempt to reap the profits of uranium it did not care whether the matter concerned Aboriginals, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the States or anything else. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  said, in answering a previous question- and I assume he will use exactly the same argument here- that under the Constitution extra powers are available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with the health and safety of people, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that nuclear material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to nuclear weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* I simply refer to clause 13 to remind the honourable member for Robertson that the right of the Governor-General only accrues when he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory, and where there is not already legislation enacted to cover the situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* The members of the Opposition say that the Minister has backed down and been stood over, firstly, by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, and secondly, he has been stood over by the States with regard to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* There seems to be no valid reason for opposing the proposition that has been put by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  because under the amendments the legislation will allow the State governments a proper exercise of some of their capacities for the protection of the Australian community.

* If the Governor-General thinks that they may be harmed due to some nuclear activity and if he thinks that the laws of the Commonwealth, other than as provided in this clause, and the laws of the State or Territory do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, under the original legislation he could require certain regulations, but under this amendment the States will be allowed to slip out from under.

* However, every supporter of the Government, including the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom),  voted for the legislation in its original form which was one of the most centralist pieces of legislation ever to come through this Parliament.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* Originally, the Committee had hoped to examine the overall needs for environmental protection in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is a major mechanism available to the Commonwealth to identify, evaluate and co-ordinate direct and indirect impacts of Commonwealth decisions on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* The purpose of the Act is to ensure that those responsible for developing proposals and those responsible for taking decisions on those proposals think about and take account of environmental factors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* The Committee noted in its report on the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> that the Act places proposals under scrutiny to a much greater degree and this has led to tensions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* Departments responsible for these activities have a good working relationship with the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and appear to fulfil the obligations placed upon them by the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* On the other hand, there are a number of departments which are not happy with the legislation and it is apparent that, while some of these departments co-operate reluctantly with the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, others use the discretion allowed under the Act to avoid referring any proposals to the Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* To help overcome these tensions and administrative inefficiencies and to ensure departments observe the spirit of the legislation, the Committee has recommended that memoranda of understanding be agreed to between the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* As a balance to the greater autonomy of departments provided by memoranda, the Committee has recommended that the Act be amended to allow the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to request and be provided with information on proposals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* The Committee recognises the responsibility of the States in environmental protection and believes that the Act should be amended to acknowledge the States' role. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* One method would be to amend the Act to give the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> discretion in the application of the Act if proposals have been subject to State procedures and that the State procedures are considered to satisfy the provisions of the Commonwealth legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* We believe that the Commonwealth should encourage other States to adopt legislation similar to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council consider the need to introduce in each State legislation similar to the Commonwealth legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* The report emphasises that there is a need for the Commonwealth to maintain powers that would enable it to intervene in environmental matters of national concern. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* Even if the States do adopt legislation similar to the Commonwealth's the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act must remain to allow in some instances independent Commonwealth assessment.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* The legislation that has been confirmedthe <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975- has been given a great deal of publicity, particularly in economic journals, because it has been anticipated that pressures particularly from mining companies would lead to a watering down, if not the complete abolition, of legislation of this type. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* When we received evidence from some of the mining companies- they put the view forward that all environmental matters ought to be the responsibility of the States- I think we were all suspicious of the fact that their enthusiasm for ending Commonwealth involvement in environmental matters was because one or two of the States in particular seemed to give the Australian mining companies almost a totally free go. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* I hope that the Government realises that it was considered by eight members from different parties who came up with very sensible solutions to some of the problems, and that there will not be any diminution- other than what is recommended in this report- of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* It is a pity that on a matter which is of significance to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation in Australia that those who have been involved in an extensive survey of existing legislation are given such limited time to speak on this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* They emphasise the intent of the Committee that environmental and conservation considerations be discussed openly and without the privacy of government inquiries and government departmental actions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* 12 states that the Minister should provide details of the reasons why a direction on an environmental impact statement on particular proposals is not given. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* I hope that then we will be able to say that at least in the decade leading up to that 200th anniversary the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament have done something to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to conserve this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* There were pressures on the Government, particularly from the Australian Mining Industry Council and its affiliates, for quite drastic changes in relation to environmental legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* Within the Government itself there were signs of considerable pressures to the extent that extremely important departments such as the Department of the Treasury and the Department of National Development- critical departments in terms of their interests in and their management of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- were extremely reluctant to appear before the Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* I refer briefly to a further agreement by Committee members that the Commonwealth has a direct and continuing responsibility in relation to preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> across Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* We received evidence and were aware of the fact that in Australia at the present time a number of major projects which are of very great environmental significance are being developed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* Quite clearly those projects which are capital intensive and energy intensive must have a massive effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the broadest sense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* I emphasise this point because it illustrates the development of our understanding of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for that reason it is important to refer to it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

* We will have to understand that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> concerns not simply the matter of protecting trees and rare species but it involves the survival of the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0)
