* Assuming that there will be food, metals and fuel for an X period of time, say 30 years, and the improvement of research will help in the continuation of these, the implications of the population explosion include the question of whether we can support increased numbers without destroying our <span class="highlight">environment</span> of land, sea, air and water.

* The administrative step of establishing the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> within the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has been taken by the Commonwealth, but this Office appears at  the  time of the preparation of this report to have done little more than play the part of a liaison agency without developing the operative co-ordinating role in Federal action that seems desirable to focus the Commonwealth's multifarious interests in spheres of activity bearing on environmental problems.

* That is why I cannot believe that any States would be sufficiently small minded to stand out from a suggestion which was made not in a spirit of taking away from the States their rights but in a spirit of what is the only solution which is available to this country to a problem which is a national problem, if we wish to preserve for those who are to follow us anything like the beauty, the majesty and the integrity of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which we inherited.

* Whilst the Government has no objection to including in the Agreement a form of words that emphasises the need to protect the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, it would not appear to it to be desirable to dictate a precise procedure for the Forestry Council and the forest services to follow in undertaking a task to which they have diligently addressed themselves in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* House of Representatives and to which I have referred will ensure not only that planting each year is carried out efficiently and in conformity with sound forestry and financial practices but also that environmental factors will have to be considered before plantations are established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* The Minister for National Development also recommended that similar special references to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be considered in any future agreements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* We are also informed that the Minister for Conservation for New South Wales had ordered a full environmental study of the Boyd Plateau region which was to be considered before further planting was undertaken. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* Incidentally, the Colong Committee asked the State Pollution Control Commission to require the Forestry Commission to submit an <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact study on Boyd Plateau. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* Of course, the whole object of the exercise was to indicate the concern of the Federal Government and of the national Parliament on the question of conservation and the preservation of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* This was to be done by an amendment to this Bill, which provided that if the Commonwealth were to provide moneys, it should be a condition precedent to the availability of those moneys that the environmental factors should be considered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* Discussions took place between  Senator Cotton  and myself - he representing  Sir Reginald  Swartz - in which it was pointed out, I think in quite compelling and convincing terms, that if we were to insert the requirement as was proposed and was executed in the amendment requiring an environmental study by an independent expert before a reafforestation programme should proceed in terms of the pending agreement, it would involve a number of things. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* In addition, the States expressed perhaps legitimate concern that this was a trespass not only on their sovereignty but also on their real solicitude and concern for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and consideration of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in any reafforestation programme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* He pointed to what he regards as specific failures by one of the States to have that regard for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the preservation of natural forest which he would always try to engender. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* I think we must accept the fact that the States are as conscious of the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as is this Parliament; and that they already have taken very many steps in their own field on questions relating to water pollution, and conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in many areas and in many forms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* However, I think it was not inappropriate that, following the presentation of this Bill and the consideration of it, the Senate should express its insistence and its concern to put on record that it should be a condition precedent to the availability of this money, in terms of the agreement, that the environmental factor, as a matter of agreement and of law, should be considered by State governments which plan to proceed with forestry plantings with money made available under this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* That will impose on the States the obligation, if this money is to be made available and utilised, that in terms of the agreement they shall be able to assure the Commonwealth that in their forward planning they have considered the environmental factor. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* The Commonwealth Government, perhaps for the first time, has taken a strong legislative stand in relation to insistence on respect for and observance of the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* As I pointed out when speaking originally to this Bill, we members of the Democratic Labor Party have been in the very forefront of the programme for environmental concern. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* It is one in which some of our members are intensely and personally interested because they serve on various national and State committees dealing with environmental protection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* In the long term, if we developed our own softwoods we might further eliminate damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* He is reported to have said, in words of encouragement to people to build industries in that State, that he would protect them from the environmentalists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* Besides that, it is in their interests to see that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is encouraged to the utmost by giving the younger trees a chance to perpetuate forests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* I said earlier that the proposal that we ure considering was a watered down version of the amendment which we carried originally and that I hoped that it would have enough teeth to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was properly protected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* However, this is what I want to know from the Minister - and he is aware that I am now speaking on the Boyd Plateau issue: Should there be a stay of proceedings until February as a result of the outcome of the New South Wales State Government's feasibility study, whatever it may be, am I to understand that when this Bill is passed today the die will be cast and it will not be impossible in February, if the day is lost by the conservationists - and 1 certainly hope it will not be - for those involved to approach the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  or, conversely to come back to the Minister for National Development  (Sir Reginald Swartz)  for Commonwealth intervention? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* Honourable senators have the acceptance of the general proposition contained in this amendment and they have the statement that the Minister for Conservation in New South Wales intends to make a full environmental impact study before proceeding with his plans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* However, we have the advantage also of having a Commonwealth Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the report by the Minister for National Development, which I will not refer to in depth but which gives his observations on the environmental importance of this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* The States require not only well trained teachers who are able to impart their knowledge to the children but also the establishment in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the schools themselves of the standards which have been set in Canberra and which should be a yardstick for the standards to which the other States should aspire and which they should seek to maintain.

* The only thing I would like to add at this stage is some reference to the amendment which has been moved by  Senator Carrick  to the effect that the Australian Government has in some way bypassed the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and that the statutory authorities and voluntary environmental and conservation groups in the Territory should be involved in these matters.

* In the latter respect, it is my understanding, from discussions that have occurred within the Standing Committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, that the States would not be prepared to enter into any such agreement or arrangement.

* As I have said, this is the first time in Australia that there has been any statutory attempt to go nearly so far in relation to environmental impact statements as this Bill seeks to go. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* In order that the true effect of the Bills can be understood I invite the attention of the Senate to the extremely embracing definition of the word <span class="highlight">environment</span>' appearing in clause 3. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I invite the attention of the Senate to the first proclamation of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> as to the scope of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as that proclamation saw it.

* I would for myself add the further point that I do not think that in the ultimate any question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the true sense can be considered in isolation from the question of planning. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I want to pay a very brief tribute to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass,  because I know from extremely bitter personal experience how difficult it is at times for a Minister charged with this type of portfolio to be able to achieve ministerial co-operation, at least completely. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* One could debate this matter at length but all I want to say is that if this Bill is passed the first thing I propose to do is to request the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to direct an inquiry on a national basis under clause 1 1 into all aspects of the wood chip industry so far as it affects Australia and our future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* The Australian Labor Government and the Minister,  Dr Cass,  in particular, have grasped the nettle with this Bill and they have given the nation of Australia a basis for hoping that man will intelligently mould to his total <span class="highlight">environment</span>, including his social groupings, to his advancement and happiness. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* In conclusion this is a day for which responsible environmentalists have hoped but their hopes, I suggest, would never have materialised without the enlightened policies of the Australian Government which now are in statutory form. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I think everybody acknowledges that in the late twentieth century the twin questions of how man controls his <span class="highlight">environment</span> and how man respects his privacy are the most vital questions for the development and future of mankind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* We see, as we did not see earlier, despoliation of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> inways which were quite perceptibly occurring but the import of which was never sufficiently appreciated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I hope that just in the expression of some views we can resolve these problems in the future and at least make the community aware that desirable and commendable as the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is, it ought not to be done at the cost of the preservation of individual privacy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* On the subject of impact statements the statement made on behalf of the then Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts read:   . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I wish to announce that the Government has decided to introduce a system of 'impact statements' designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* That is to say that when a Commonwealth Minister prepares a submission to the Cabinet on any proposal that has some relevance to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that submission must be accompanied by a statement setting out the impact the proposal is likely to make on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I might add that State projects for which Commonwealth financial assistance is sought will also need to be supported by assurances that all environmental factors have been considered and evaluated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* However, one difference is to be noted, and that is that under the proposals which the Government is implementing, it seeks to have its own impact statement procedures apply to Commonwealth financed State projects, whereas the view of the previous Governmentand it would be the view which the present Opposition parties would preferably follow- was that the State procedures ought to be sufficient for an effective evaluation of impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of various types of proposals.

* I go further: On 3 1 October I asked the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation who represents the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in this place a question about the Newport power station project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I also asked the Minister whether he was aware that this attitude was being taken against a background of exhaustive inquiries into the environmental impact of such a power station and the fact that those inquiries had been held and that all of them had been resolved in favour of the power station. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I asked the Minister whether he was prepared, in the interests of balanced and sensible environmental policies and with a view to upholding the authority of the State of Victoria, to express his strong support for the Victorian Government's position.

* Senator Wheeldon,  the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, stated quite categorically in simple words 'no'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* The Victorian legislation which will be to a large extent duplicated by this legislation- indeed, it may even be superseded, but ultimately that is for the High Court to decide- indicates that there is an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority and an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Appeals Board which can examine whether projects in Victoria are consistent with what is required for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* It is a challenge to the authority of the Government and it is being conducted in the name of <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* -And <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection, to answer the Minister, is the name of this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I believe we ought to have an attitude expressed by the Government which clearly discloses where it stands on this matter with regard to State <span class="highlight">environment</span> projects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I have said earlier that the need to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is quite clear and unchallengeable, but this Bill imposes upon individuals the right to submit to the requests of persons appointed by the Minister- who are not judicial officers but who may be anybody in the community whom the Minister appoints- to attend before them, to answer questions, to produce documents, and indeed to allow their properties and premises to be entered without any warrant whatsoever. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* But I suggest that you cannot resolve satisfactorily these environmental protection questions by simply saying that individuals can be subjected to all sorts of impositions, to coercive powers, because the <span class="highlight">environment</span> requires that individuals must submit to those powers.

* I would hope that based on the evolutionary experience of planning in Australia members of the Opposition will not turn the clock back; that they will learn from the experiences of people even within their own Party and within their own State governments; that they will even at this late hour discuss the matter with  Mr Fuller,  the Minister for Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in New South Wales, and with  Mr Hamer  in Victoria and those other enlightened Ministers who, based on their experiences, have seen the need to change the emphasis from the bureaucracy back to the Parliament; that the Senate will not be stampeded, on the basis of a false, incorrect and inadequate understanding of what is involved in this important Darwin Reconstruction Bill, into amending the Bill, emasculating it and rendering it sterile when the important job is to pass the Bill to enable the Australian Government properly to carry out its responsibilities to the people in Darwin.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* As  Chairman  of the new Committee I was fortunate in having as fellow committee members, 3 senators who had served on the former Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee and who accordingly brought a large measure of continuity to the ongoing inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* In conformity with its terms of reference, the Committee concentrated its attention on the immediate environmental impact of woodchip programs, that is to say, the impact on soil, air and water and on forest fauna and flora. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* Other environmental threats, notably those relating to soil nutrients, wildlife preservation, and conservation of genetic characteristics, are less well understood and require further research to identify their true nature and magnitude and to determine ways to counter them effectively. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* The total environmental impact of woodchip operations cannot be fully assessed at this time because of the large number of inadequately researched factors to be taken into account. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* Empirical observations coupled with experience and some research tend to indicate that, in the short term, present operations in relatively restricted areas are acceptable provided environmental prescriptions are observed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* It is not for me as a Minister at this distance to evaluate the pluses or minuses of the project and it is not for anyone else to do so without a knowledge of the environmental impact study, without a knowledge of the report from the Foreign Investment Review Board and without knowing what are basically the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government and what is in the small print as to the nature of the undertaking, the involvement of the Australian people, whether it will be something that will create substantial employment for Australians and whether it can attract considerable tourism to Australia.

* My colleague, the Attorney-General, will be introducing a Bill to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in relation to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region, at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, or the appropriate Land Council.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0)

* The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry saw the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council as having a special interest in reinforcing the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection machinery in the Alligator Rivers Region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0)

* It saw as an advantage of the recommendations it made with regard to Aboriginal ownership of land and the creation of the national park that there would be people with the interest and knowledge to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of mining operations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0)

 Mr President, this Bill, together with the related Bills which are being introduced, are a further earnest of the Government's determination that the development of uranium mining in Australia will be carefully controlled and proceed in a responsible manner with Full regard to the need for protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of all Australians.

* The object of this Bill is to establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects of nuclear activities here in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* It will enable governments to ensure that the nuclear industry in Australia is so regulated as to afford the utmost protection to people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with health and safety of people, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that nuclear material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to nuclear weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Should any unforeseen situation arise as a result of a nuclear activity, which is not regulated or controlled by a Commonwealth, State or Territory law, and which is likely to affect health, safety or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the GovernorGeneral will have power, under clause 1 3 of the Bill, to authorise the appropriate Federal Minister to act to control hazards associated with the situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* However, it is our judgment, after considering all relevant factors, that a contingency provision of this nature is a proper and responsible discharge of our duty to provide for the health and safety of people in Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Orders made under the provisions of this clause have effect only in relation to situations likely to affect health and safety, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, that arises from nuclear activities, as defined in the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Generally, we would see the steps involved in arriving at approved codes of practice as including: initial drafting by the appropriate Commonwealth Department (for example Department of Health for health codes, Department of Transport for transport codes, Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development for general <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection codes); consultation on the proposed draft code with relevant State and Territory Ministers; the release, where appropriate, of the draft code for public comment, particularly by in dustry and Trade Unions; consideration of the draft code by relevant Advisory Councils such as the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council; final consideration within the Government and submission to the Governor-General; the provision of an order in writing by the Governor-General approving the code; tabling of the order approving the code of practice in both Houses of Parliament.

* This body of eminent non-government professional people has already played a most significant part in advising the Government on the effects of the various actual and potential sources of ionising radiation exposure on the Australian population and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, which carried out an inquiry during the period 1974 to 1 975- at the time of the Whitlam Labor Governmenton the operation of the first two forestry softwood agreements also expressed concern in its report about the lack of research available to the industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* That concern which was expressed by the FORWOOD conference and also by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation led to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics conducting a study of the industry, the report of which was finally published in 1977.

* If we were to go along with the idea of referring this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> or to the National Resources Committee, we would not achieve our purpose because no mention of new plantings is made in the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* New sections are to be inserted after section 23 of the principal Act to empower any person authorised by the land council to obtain information and documents relating either to uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region or to the applications made by the lands council to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory concerning matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator Rivers Region.

* The provisions protect the power of corporate secrecy and make Aborigines impotent to challenge a company if it considers that disclosing its technical information might tend to incriminate it in regard to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>.

* In brief, the amendments are, firstly, to necessitate a public inquiry before the confirmation of the nuclear codes; secondly, to establish an environmental protection advisory council independent of government control; and, thirdly, to require that codes not be confirmed until after public inquiry and findings have been reported to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* For the reasons I have stated with regard to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the defence powers of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* This package of legislation deals, as I said, with amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, with aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region where the mines are situated, and with Aboriginal land rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* They even cover aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I support the Government on these two Bills, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The second Bill, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, is mainly a machinery Bill which will allow us, when the mines commence, to lay down certain regulations under which the rnining operations can take place and which will allow for safeguards, for the men working there and those who would be involved down the line in transport and other ancillaries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I  shall turn briefly to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The stated purpose of this Bill is 'to provide for a code of practice so that nuclear activities are effectively controlled throughout the country in the interests of health, safety and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* We must understand that the Parliament operates in a society in which there should be freedom of discussion and debate on these matters and that persons involved in that process of freedom of discussion and debate should not be subjected to the sort of pernicious powers which are available to the Government under the Atomic Energy Act and which will be available to the Government if the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is passed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It simply enables the creation of codes designed to protect the health and safety of the people of Australia and to protect the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> from possible harmful effects of nuclear activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I repeat that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is simply an enabling Bill designed to enable Australians and Australia to be protected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* He alleged that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill goes beyond the protection of the health and safety of the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly.

* Further to the Prime Minister 's letter of 3 1 August 1 977, 1 understand the Prime Minister will shortly send you a draft copy of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It says that the Minister may authorise a person to issue any orders the Minister considers necessary to control or to eliminate any hazards, assumed or otherwise, to the health or the safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from any nuclear activity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* As it turned out, all six States objected to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The States maintain objections to the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act similar to those they have in respect of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Three of the States have been quite specific in restricting their remarks to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In consequence of the failure of the Commonwealth to consult with the States, the Prime Minister announced that he would amend the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill in a minor way, namely, by delaying the proclamation of key sections of the Bill until further consultation had taken place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* We ought to take into account the damage being done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by conventional power stations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In doing so something like 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide and many kilos of nitrous oxides are liberated to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* These create tremendous environmental problems which are not evident from nuclear power stations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Nuclear power stations pose no threat to the atmospheric <span class="highlight">environment</span> at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* We are liberating all this carbon dioxide to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is increasing, slowly but surely, the temperature of our close <span class="highlight">environment</span> to a degree-  Senator Coleman  says she is worried about life- which will necessitate serious contemplation in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It is a serious environmental threat. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Moreover, the nitrous oxides and other gases that are liberated from conventional power stations pursue a course which takes them to the ozone area and would endanger the environmental shield and increase the threat to life in this world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill does nothing to protect or safeguard human health or safety or to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The two Bills now being debated cognately are the Atomic Energy Amendment BUI and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* How does the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill or the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill protect that intimacy? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I have said already that these Bills will not even protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I take this opportunity,  Mr President,  to draw your attention to Part HI of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, which is grandiosely entitled 'Codes of Practice'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Paragraph (a) states that it may:  specify standards to bc observed, practices and procedures to be followed and measures (including measures for or in relation to the restoration of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the effects of nuclear activities) to be taken with respect to nuclear activities; [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* We observe that clauses 11 and 13 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill have come in for some comment from the Opposition and from some State Premiers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The extended period meant that the Lands, Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly had time to complete its own examination of the proposals and to report to the Assembly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I take part in this debate very conscious of the fact that the Government assumes that the Bills- the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978- will establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* I refer to a document entitled 'Conclusions and Recommendations of Report "Nuclear Power Costs" <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Energy and Natural Resources Sub-Committee of Committee on Government Operations, United States Congress'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, the government would be empowered to declare codes of practice to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and health and safety of Australians from the effects of uranium mining and other nuclear activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* However, clause 14(1) (d) of this bill ensures that the government can suppress any information relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, health and safety standards at uranium mines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The Bill leaves it to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to decide whether the public will have a chance to comment on proposed health, safety and environmental codes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The presentation of this legislation is a cynical exercise which has little to do with health, safety, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or nuclear safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill overrides several powers now exercised by the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* I seek your support and co-operation in deferring the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Act Amendment Bill until full and proper consultations have taken place at the Premiers Conference due on June 22.

* We strongly urge you to oppose the passage of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill when they come before the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Our technology is not yet sufficiently advanced to deal with all the known effects on human health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of nuclear energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Radon is one of the rare gases, without chemical properties, and the only way to remove it from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is to freeze it out with a coolant like liquid air. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Whilst on the one hand mouthing pious sentiments about the need for consultation between State and Federal governments before codes are proclaimed or enforced, the Government has so worded the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act that, in fact, the States have no rights at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Clauses 8 and 11 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill are cases in point. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* I am not in the slightest degree equipped by education or experience to pass a judgment upon the issues to which  Senator Haines-  adopting the views of others as well as speaking for herselfhas referred with so much concern but I have tried to follow them and I have formed my own judgment in the light of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and the debates that have been held. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Nevertheless, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 that are before us disclose a real concern although that may only be in deference to a significant section of public opinion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* I will refer only to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 which I will call the 'code' Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* So clause 9 inserts into the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill these provisions which, to the unsceptical would induce the first blush. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Proposed section 13 in Part V- Miscellaneous- of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill provides: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The first is that I believe that the findings of the independent inquiry into CSIRO have vindicated this Government's practice of minimising bureaucratic influence on scientific research and providing the proper <span class="highlight">environment</span> for innovation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0)

* Briefly it involves achieving a sustained reduction in inflation and creating the <span class="highlight">environment</span> both internally and externally for an expansion in the private sector. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-60-0)

* I think that anyone listening to the debate in this chamber or elsewhere tonight would not have been aware that he was talking about the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, which are two important subjects to Australia that do not figure in his dissertation at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Let me refer first to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill which is an unusual piece of legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Clause 1 3 of the Bill gives powers to the Governor-General to deal with special situations if he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, are likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Therefore, I have some concern about the results and the effectiveness of this particular <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* To requests by State governments for withdrawal of the legislation to enable reconsideration, the Prime Minister has responded that sections 1 1 and 13 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, should not commence in relation to the States until the views of the States have been considered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* The second Bill, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes ) Bill 1 978, is an important Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* This second Bill proposes to establish measures to protect the health and safety of the people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from possible harmful effects of nuclear activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* The Government clearly intends to proceed with the mining of uranium regardless of the consequences to health, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Aboriginal people and their aspirations for land rights, civil liberties and world peace and security.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0)

* On the other hand, the Australian Labor Party, the Opposition, has several major objectives in this matter: Firstly, the prevention of mining; secondly the securing of Aboriginal land rights in an unqualified manner; thirdly, the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; and, fourthly, the protection of the health of this community.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* We do support the principle that a jurisdiction should be established in relation to the enforcement of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region, but we do not agree that this jurisdiction should be in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* I was very impressed when I visited the Lucas Heights establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission to learn that the Commission itself has been studying the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Kakadu area over a period of years and certainly recognises the fragility of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly in the wet season when the floods can occur.

* In setting effective anti-pollution safeguards not only is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protected but mining companies immediately know the standards which they must maintain and will know if and when they can operate so removing speculation from their acitivities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* They are the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which is more localised, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill, which deals with much broader areas but which still deals with conservation and protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill.

* My concern at the moment is that the community can be misled by statements about, as some people would put it, the lack of concern, where it is proposed to mine uranium in the Northern Territory, for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* The Government is doing all that it possibly can, as I said earlier, in regard to marketing by way of its guidelines, and in regard to mining and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally in the area of the Northern Territory where that mining is to take place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* In dealing with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which concerns a local area, we can see very clearly just how much effort is being put into making sure that there will be environmental control and protection; that the Government will even go as far as to make sure that those activities are coordinated [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* Not only has the Government set up a consultative committee with a supervising scientist, to whom  Senator Jessop  referred this morning when he spoke to this legislation, but also it has gone further and set up a research institute to ensure that the work will not be purely observational but will involve research to make sure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> both in the short and long terms will be protected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* We are now talking about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the concern which is being expressed by a State government which has sent me and no doubt you,  Mr President,  as a South Australian senator, a telex criticising the Federal Government because the Federal Government is openly bringing in legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and doing all it can to make sure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* The problem is that if people, businesses or companies breach the enviromental protection measures outlined in the Bill in such a way as would be destructive to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to the health of workers in the industry, or to the community generally, they may conceal that breach by claiming that the information which would establish it would lead to their incrimination.

* All honourable senators know that the whole thrust of the Labor Senate Opposition's argument in the earlier weeks of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill was that the Government had been recreant in not consulting the States and that it was imperative that the States should be consulted fully and their views sought and understood, presumably so that a consensus could be reached.

* One of the few remaining features of the Westminster system as we have it in Canberra is that even though partisan politics are practised on the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives, when matters are referred to a committee such as the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, the members of the committees quite often- in fact, more often than not- lose their political identity and are able to reach a consensus.

* Our position is based not only on our demonstrated concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also on the numerous reports of inquiries which have been presented to this Parliament on this matter, particularly the report of the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources and, of course, the report of the royal commission which inquired into this matter.

* As it appears that the Minister for Transport and his Department are not particularly interested in retaining any form of manning for that lighthouse, will the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> endeavour to co-ordinate an approach involving the Tasmanian Government, the Bureau of Meteorology, the maritime services rescue coordination centre and the various other organisations which have been referred to in questions which have been asked in this chamber over a period of 12 months or more, in order to put together a plan which will enable that lighthouse to continue to be manned for all the purposes which have been made so clear so often in this chamber?
