* The point I want to make is this: I saw some of the crocodile tears expressed by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  about the rights of migrants and I wondered whether he had referred back to speeches such as those I made in the past 5 years in which I begged the then Government to change the Crimes Act in order to avoid discrimination against people who had acquired Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> not having been born in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1)

* Senator Murphy  had a tough decision to make and I say, not only to the Senate but also to the people outside - whether they be native-born Australians or people who have acquired Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> by adoption - that we have a system of priorities of safety for the overseas visitor and later remove discriminating provisions of the Crimes Act which were directed at the ethnic component of our population.

* I have known a number of people who were given adverse reports by ASIO but when I, and no doubt other senators too, took up their cases, even on a number of occasions under nonLabor Ministers for Immigration, we were suddenly proved correct and <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> granted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1)

* I say that because I know people who were grossly victimised when they applied for naturalisation and who, when we protested, were granted <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> - and that ASIO then approached them and asked them whether they would serve in certain listening post capacities.

* I look forward in the not far distant future to the time when the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Murphy,  will be introducing amendments to the Crimes Act which will meet a situation in which many post-war migrants had reservations about receiving second class <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> in Australia.

* In essence, the committee is to inquire, first into whether the civil rights of a number of Australians,  specifically migrants - and, more specifically, people of Croatian origin - are being infringed; secondly, whether there is any intimidation against any such Australians from any source, specifically from agents or officers of the Yugoslav Government, whether those persons be intelligence agents or secret police of that government, or from some other source; thirdly, to inquire into the circumstances of the visit by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  to the offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in March; and fourthly to look virtually at the problems that now arise of dual <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> of migrants and the threat to their lives and to their freedom when they travel abroad.

* I begin by speaking to the main part of the Bill which deals with the grant of <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* The guiding principle for the Government in the vitally important matter of the grant of Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> is that there should not be discrimination between different groups of settlers seeking to join the family of the nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* So it is that this Bill provides For all, regardless of origins, the same requirements as to residence, good character, knowledge of the language and of the rights and duties of <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, and intention to live here permanently. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* To avoid any suggestion of breaking faith with people who have recently come here or who come in the year after the new Act commences, and who understood before coming that they could apply after one year, the Bill provides a transitional period of 2 years during which such people will be able to apply for <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> after only one year's residence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* This means that migrants from all the 31 Commonwealth countries will now have the same opportunity as other migrants to take part in <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> ceremonies suitably marking the important occasion of their becoming citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* By these means, and by ali other possible means, it is the Government's wish to ensure that our migrants from Commonwealth countries are no longer ignored or left in the mistaken belief that they acquire our <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> automatically and that the rest of the Australian community attaches no importance to their becoming citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* It is important to end the confusion which has been permitted to continue since the <span class="highlight">Citizenship</span> Act of 1949 and the use of terminology which has given many Australian the mistaken impression they are not only Australian citizens but also citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* A Creek citizen remains, a Greek under Greek law, and an American ceases to be an America^ tinder American law, upon their becoming Australians, quite irrespective of whether they say at our <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> ceremonies tha* they renounce Greek or American <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> And so I put it to honourable senators nhat it is both the humane and the sane course to drop these distressing and Ineffectual words about renunciation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* All that is sought by this change is to clarify the real position for those candidates for our <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> who find it hard to understand why they are to swear allegiance to a monarch they have understood to be primarily Queen of another country where they pave never lived and never intend to live. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* Turning from the main provisions concerning grant of <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, another change achieved by the Bill is to bring up to date the list of Commonwealth countries whose citizens have the status of British subject under the <span class="highlight">Citizenship</span> Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* The Bill also proposes, in line with the age qualification for voting, that a person shall be deemed to be of full age for <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> purposes when he has reached 18 years of age. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* But once we confer the <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> of this country upon a person who has come to this country as an immigrant and who has resided in this country we owe to that person 2 things: We owe him the obligation, firstly, that we will treat him as an equal of persons who are natural-born Australians and subject him to no penalties, prohibitions or disabilities which are different from those to which the natural-born citizens are subjected; and, secondly, that we will not deport him to a country where he may be dealt with not on the basis of his conduct but simply on the basis of his political opinions.

* They are to be known as <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> ceremonies instead of naturalisation ceremonies, a description with which most of us are familiar. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* Finally, the age for <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> is to be lowered to  18  years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* As I said, the Bill deals with <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> and the word 'citizen' relates to 'nation building' and to 'national'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* Australian communities need the support of these migrant citizens and I think it is also true to say that the migrant needs the support of being part of the community, and being part of the community through <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, because through <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> he can obtain  various supports that he may need from time to time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* All of us speak from experience and association in this field and we know that in deciding to accept Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> a migrant takes into account personal reasons, family reasons, employment situations; he looks at the geographical influences and he takes very strong cognisance of the state and political factors.

* When we discuss a measure of this kind we discuss it against the background of immigration and immigration policies, because immigration policies determine the number and the quality or style of people that come into Australia and therefore the numbers and style and quality of people are very much related to the whole matter of <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* A policy which assumes that the total of the individual wishes of relatives and friends will always equal Australia's needs is not a good policy but one, I think, which should be watched very carefully for it takes into account the style, quality and quantity of <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> within this country.

* In the present Bill the provision relating to the 12 months period is repealed, and although there are clauses which allow for transition periods to take care of people who may want to make the adjustment in the immediate future, the ultimate fact is that Commonwealth citizens - 'British people - have had the benefit of this 12 months period taken away from them and in due course they will have to wait 3 years before they can obtain their <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* But  I do  agree that the term '<span class="highlight">citizenship</span> ceremony' has more meaning to it and, as such, I approve of the change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* We are trying to make suggestions which will help the Government of today and those who formed the Government of yesterday to see this Bill through similar eyes because we feel that in tackling a re-organisation of legislation such as this it would be a constructive move to bring it up to date, to make it more efficient and to make it easier to offer <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> to the new people of Australia - a <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> which we all want them to have.

 Mr Carr the British Minister responsible for United Kingdom <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> status in relation to Britain's entry into the European Common Market indicated that even with the best intentions in the world the old links with Australia and New Zealand, and probably to a lesser degree Canada, were not quite the same.

* I object - I will not take this belief to the, point of voting accordingly - that the British migrant should have to wait 3 years, exactly the same length of time as a migrant from any other country, before he is granted <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* Apart from the fact that I do not think it has any legal significance whatever in the country of origin, there must be a certain amount of heartburn and a certain amount of emotional turmoil when, at a <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> ceremony, this phrase has to be repeated by the applicant for <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* As we know from the arguments which we have had about dual <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> in Greece, Yugoslavia and the United States, we are not able, by any law which this Parliament passes, to remove the legal effectiveness of laws enacted by a person's country of origin when that person returns to the jurisdiction of his country of origin.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* I think that most, if not all members of the Parliament, will agree that the Government's intention to do away with discrimination in regard to <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> is a very laudable objective. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* The simple fact is, as I pointed out in my second reading speech, that British <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, as we know it in this country, relates to no fewer than 31 different countries.

 Australian <span class="highlight">Citizenship</span> Bill 2329 a monarch and which provides for succession, I think that that is the course that should be followed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47)

* By having the declaration on our statute books that the Queen is our head of state according to the 5  June  1973 style and title which the Government is proposing, and by including the reference to renunciation, our migrant citizens will be protected and we will guard against situations in which migrants might use their <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> unscrupulously. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47)

* All that is sought by this change is to clarify the real position for those candidates for our <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> who find it hard to understand why they are to swear allegiance to a monarch they have understood to be primarily Queen of another country where they have never lived and never intend to live. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0)
