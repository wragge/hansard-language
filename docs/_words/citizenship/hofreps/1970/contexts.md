* To place this matter in its correct perspective let me say that in the period from 1st January 1949 to 30th June 1969 some 580,000 persons were granted Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, and during that time only 405 persons were refused <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> in accordance with the policy I explained earlier.

* The fact that a number of migrants do not make application for Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> results, I believe, from a fusion of factors which would include indecision at to longterm permanent residence in Australia; the fact that they may be waiting for other members of the family to become eligible before themselves making application; unawareness of the importance of <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>; or being aware, the fact that they have not come to the point of making application or would prefer to become further established in the Australian community before playing a complete and meaningful part.

* It has always been the policy of the Commonwealth Government that migrants should become Australian citizens, not so much for the material benefits which this would confer upon them but rather because <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, once conferred, would enable them to play their full part as Australian citizens in the affairs of the community and to have the opportunity of total identification with the people of Australia.

* If one were prepared in this debate to go through chapter and verse and to take each of the Press statements which the Minister has put out on the question of <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> directly relevant to this Bill, or on other matters - as my colleagues will do later - one would find that very little of what has been claimed as initiative on behalf of the Government can, in fact, be traced back to the initiative of the present Minister.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* This conjures up a picture of tens of thousands of British migrants seriously disaffected because they do not have the privilege of being naturalised at a naturalisation ceremony and, instead, are seriously discriminated against by being able to acquire <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> by registration.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* Indeed, it can be claimed that a substantial proportion of the people who do not take out Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, particularly those from Britain, settle in Australia so successfully and naturally that the act of acquiring Australian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> does not occur to them, or if it does it does not appear to add anything of significance to their life in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* Recognising this, to save Australia from further embarrassment as a nation which has discriminatory <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>, and to bring some justice to migrants, to rescue the Bill from a Senate pigeon-hole - now a deep well for all sorts of things which have been irresponsibly rejected - this Government reluctantly accepts the Senate amendment and  1  commend the motion that I have moved.
