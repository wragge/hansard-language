### Sample sentences:

* This Bill is a token of our dedication in that direction and of the endeavours that will be pursued in this session of the Parliament to ensure that there will be no discrimination between citizens; that there will be one <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>; that there will be one criterion; that there will be one allegiance.

* Statistics of persons granted <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> by country of former <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> and year of arrival in Australia can however be compiled and will be made available to the honourable member as soon as possible.

* I conclude by saying that Lady Adermann, the honourable Evan Adermann and other members of the family, can be very proud of  Sir Charles  Adermann 's outstanding record of public service and the fact that he always maintained the very highest standard of public spirited Christian <span class="highlight">citizenship</span>.

* I must say that the very fact that we have announced that we are to make a review of the whole British <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> laws is an indication that we think the time may have to come when changes will be needed.

* 1 am gravely disturbed at the very many cases which occur in Australia where people seeking <span class="highlight">citizenship</span> find their applications rejected largely on the basis of some sort of secret report which often comes from countries outside; from such great democracies' - I ask Hansard to put inverted commas around 'democracies' - as Spain and Portugal.
