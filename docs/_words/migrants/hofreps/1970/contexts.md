* Another vital point in favour of sea transportation is that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> can bring their personal effects and household belongings with them on the ship without charge,, whereas if they come by air they are substantially limited in the amount of baggage they can take with them and any excess has to be paid by the Government or the migrant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* I refer to the Sitmar Line which has transported <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration from the early 1950s and under official contract to the Australian Government since 1956. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* I have no business connection with the Sitmar -Line but, like many honourable members on both sides of the House who have informed themselves as to the service being provided for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia by this company, I have a full appreciation of the excellent way in which it has carried out its contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* It is well known that with the advent of the Sitmar Line in 1956 stabilisation of the rates being charged to us by the shipping companies which carried <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia was brought about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> had complete access to all parts of its vessels; this did not obtain previously with other lines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* It must also be remembered that Sitmar's contribution to Australia has not been limited to the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* Finally, I would like to say to the Minister that this company has carried 250,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia without the loss of one life and to the satisfaction of those travelling on its vessels as well as to the contractual authorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* I hope that the excellent service given by this company is recognised by the Minister and that within any limita- tions that might apply he will see that everything possible is done to retain its ships on the Australia run, which could be in doubt if its services for the transportation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is not utilised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* The background to this issue is that in response to an invitation by the Government on 19th August last to all passenger shipping lines operating from Europe to Australia, 3 companies offered to carry <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by sea on a contract basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* Up to 15,000 berths are to be taken at the option of the Commonwealth for the carriage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Britain and northern Europe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* I emphasise that the arrangements are confined to Britain and northern Europe and do not include the transport of the balance of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from elsewhere in Europe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* The remainder of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under the assisted passage programme from the northern area will be carried by Qantas Airways Ltd and/ or its associates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* The new transport arrangements negotiated by the Government involve a change of contractor and an increased use of air movement for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* The new contractor, Chandris Line, has carried <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for many years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* By the end of the 3-year period of the contract it is expected that approximately 75% of assisted passage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will travel by air from Britain and northern Europe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* Already the movement of assisted passage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by air has grown to half the total assisted passage programme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* This represents an exercise of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>' own preference for this form of travel and is consistent with world trends in general passenger movement by air. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* This is underlined by the fact that programmes from areas where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are now moved totally by air have not suffered in any way because of this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* I emphasise that, contrary to the impression given by the right honourable member for Melbourne, it is not valid to say that 50% of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> elect to travel by sea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* Because of commitments to sea berths it has been necessary in the past to have this proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> travel by sea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* The right honourable member for Melbourne also mentioned the advantage to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Europe travelling by sea in that there is provision for training in the English language. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* As 85% to 90% of the people carried under this contract are from Britain there is little weight in the argument that by curtailing sea travel we are denying <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the opportunity to learn English. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* There is no evidence at all available to me or to my Department which suggests that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> settle down more readily if they travel by sea, or that there is a greater returnee rate amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who travel by air. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* I do not see that the voluntary organisations or other people nominating <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be disadvantaged because of air travel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* It should be remembered that 50%, and sometimes more than 50%, of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> now travel from the United Kingdom by air. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* The large air movement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over the past 10 years has demonstrated that the 88 lb of luggage a person provided for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming by air has been sufficient to cover the belongings that they wished to bring with them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* I am confident, as is my Department, that the new arrangements for the carriage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will prove to be effective in future years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* Many of those recently settled, such as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, are still in the process of buying their homes and the closure of the gold mining will simply mean that a substantial number of these people will be obliged to pack up and leave Kalgoorlie without a penny to bless themselves with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0)

* 1 preface my question to the Minister for Social Services by reminding him that yesterday the honourable member for Perth asked the Minister for Immigration whether he was aware of the concern and resentment of elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who found that, in spite of naturalisation, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years and he referred to their complaints of being treated as second class citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0)

* Further, is it not a fact that the Australian Labor Party also required <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to become Australian citizens before being eligible to receive age pensions and is it not a fact that it was this LiberalCountry Party Government which removed this bar to the receipt of pensions by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0)

* This Government and its predecessors have done more in this field to help <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than any other government has done. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0)

* I will be happy to provide the House and the honourable member with a detailed account of what the Government has done in this field, but I suggest to the House that we have gone as far as it is possible to go in helping <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who meet some misfortune when they arrive in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0)

* It is true, of course, that pensions payable in Australia are vastly greater than the pensions available in the countries from which many of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0)

* As the honourable member for Wide Bay says, a lot of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as well. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29)

* We arc told that, of some 185,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who will come to Australia in 1970, approximately one-third will settle in the West. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29)

* I contend it is unnecessary, just as it is unnecessary to require <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to meet a 3-year residential qualification. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29)

* In the meantime are Maltese <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with British status restricted to a residential qualifying period in the same way as are aliens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-18)

* Is there a residency qualification, notwithstanding naturalisation, of 10 years for eligibility for an age pension and 5 years for eligibility for an invalid pension for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from most countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-22)

* If so, do some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> therefore receive the invalid pension until they reach the age of 65 years (for males) or 60 years (for females) and then lose all pension benefits until they have been in this country for 10 years and become eligible for an age pension. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-22)

* I ask the Minister for Immigration whether his attention has been drawn to a recent article in a South Australian newspaper quoting  Mr Giordano,  publisher of a monthly bulletin, as saying that more should be done in the field of housing for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* Will he comment also on the progress of the new flat programme for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and indicate when this programme will be applied to South Australia? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* J recall seeing the article to which the honourable gentleman refers and, as 1 interpret my recollection of that article,  Mr Giordano  was suggesting that the Commonwealth should provide flats which could be sold to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at low rates of interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* The question of permanent accommodation for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> does not fall within my sphere of responsibility but I want to observe two factors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* States are the principal suppliers, of relatively low cost housing for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement the Commonwealth has made available substantial sums of money to the States to finance these programmes but the Commonwealth has no control over their implementation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* In the second place, since the inception of the migration programme it has generally been agreed that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should not be placed in a position of advantage or preferment in connection with housing or other facilities by comparison with native born members of the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* However this does not preclude measures being taken to offset the disadvantages at which resettlement places <span class="highlight">migrants</span> vis-a-vis the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* In answer to the latter part of the honourable member's question as I recall it, I inform him that our responsibility as a Commonwealth lies in the provision of initial transitory accommodation for Commonwealth nominated <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which takes 2 forms, flats and hostels. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0)

* What consideration has been extended to the proposal that a reciprocal agreement should be negotiated between Australia and Malta which would have the effect of extending to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Malta of British nationality the same social service benefits which accrue to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Britain and New Zealand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-3)

* Why do eligible <span class="highlight">migrants</span> not apply for citizenship? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0)

* I recall that, when I last checked the matter to which the honourable member refers, I ascertained that as at 30th June 1969 there were some 208,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over the age of 16 years and residentially qualified for Australian citizenship who had not made application. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0)

* The fact that a number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not make application for Australian citizenship results, I believe, from a fusion of factors which would include indecision at to longterm permanent residence in Australia; the fact that they may be waiting for other members of the family to become eligible before themselves making application; unawareness of the importance of citizenship; or being aware, the fact that they have not come to the point of making application or would prefer to become further established in the Australian community before playing a complete and meaningful part. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0)

* It has always been the policy of the Commonwealth Government that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should become Australian citizens, not so much for the material benefits which this would confer upon them but rather because citizenship, once conferred, would enable them to play their full part as Australian citizens in the affairs of the community and to have the opportunity of total identification with the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0)

* by leave -  Mr Speaker,  one of the major new immigration initiatives to be taken by the Government in the course of this Parliament is in the area of migrant education - an area vital to the effective integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0)

* The Government has approved details of a comprehensive programme of migrant education which will strengthen existing provisions and give effect to the policy announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on 8th October 1969 of Commonwealth financial support for new, improved and expanded facilities for the instruction of child and adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the English language. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0)

* The Government recognises that the ability of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to communicate is fundamental to their successful integration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0)

* There are short and long term social and human benefits for the migrant and for the community in encouraging and providing the means for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn English. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0)

* New areas of need have become evident, and whilst there have been practical reasons in the past to concentrate on speaking and understanding the English language, the comprehensive programme now proposed will provide for more emphasis in the future to be placed on reading and writing English, on meeting the individual needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and on their citizenship education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0)

* The comprehensive programme will provide for: The expansion of existing facilities for the instruction of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; the provision of intensive full time English language courses for those who must know English so that they can be employed in the occupations and professions for which they have been trained and are qualified; and classes for migrant school children with English language difficulties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0)

* I believe that a lack of knowledge of the language of the country sponsoring a great migration programme is the greatest barrier to the integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their social and economic success. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7)

* Whilst we deal with the problems of children and teachers and questions relating to the social and economic integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, at this stage there appears to be a much more lively interest being taken by the Government and organisations in the education of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7)

* He said that a survey by the Department of Immigration indicated that about one-third of foreign born <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot speak English and that departmental English classes assist only a small proportion of them.

* One aspect of the migration programme that appears to come under criticism at this stage is that, whilst thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are being brought to the country, the States are not being given a commensurate amount of money to provide education, housing and other factors associated with a great migration programme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7)

* If this programme is fulfilled in the way that the Minister has outlined today and comes to fruition as he has said, it undoubtedly will be a forward step in providing for the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their integration into the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7)

* At this stage I see no reason why it should be opposed - we may be able to improve it - and I join with the Minister in expressing the hope that it will allow the thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who today suffer from not having a thorough understanding of the English language to integrate socially and economically and in every way take full advantage of the opportunities given to them in this country under the migration programme.

* In the first place, as the House will appreciate, the governments of a number of countries from which we draw our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly those in the European area, take the view that under their nationality laws a former citizen of one of those countries does not lose his citizenship of that country if he acquires Australian citizenship.

* I must say that I am unaware of the reasons which were advanced for it but I want to observe that over a quarter of a century in which Australia has had experience in the promotion of a high level immigration programme our record in relation to selection and assessment of the 2.6 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to this country post- 1945 has been very good.

* I think of the reports we have received of the incidence of mental illness and crime among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; of the reports that we have received on migrant youth; of the fact that the Australian system has been well commended by international authorities in the field of immigration; of the fact that our experience has been sought by other countries with high level immigration programmes, and finally of the fact that 2.6 million people who have come here in the post-war period have with some difficulties been effectively integrated into the Australian community.

* The present scheme was introduced by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  when he was Minister for immigration in the Chifley Government, and it has been continued by succeeding Liberal and Country Party Governments.I think it is a matter for some pride, that Australia has absorbed some 2.6 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> since 1945.

* If I can give a measurement of this contribution, in 1968-69 out of a total Australian work force of 5.27 million people about 1.3 million were <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* People speak, quite rightly, about the cost of bringing settlers to Australia, but we must always remember that a significant proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are classified as skilled or semiskilled personnel and their settling here has been estimated to save Australia $US8,000 per average worker in preemployment training. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* This must not be a one-way process though, as there is still a tremendous need for the Australian community as a whole to gain a more knowledgeable attitude and fuller appreciation of the problems immigrants face and the ways in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span>* contributions to this country's future can be realised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I firmly believe our immigration policy should be based on the needs of this country, the availability of suitable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the capacity of the Australian community to integrate <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into our society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* This requires that personnel employed at our overseas selection centres should be equipped and trained to promulgate an accurate picture of Australian conditions to ensure that intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not get a false impression of this country and the conditions they are likely to experience when they arrive here. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* It also requires that the selection procedures for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be such as to reduce to a minimum selection of undesirable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or those who would experience untoward difficulty in assimilating into the society of this country.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I believe the Department of Immigration is aware of these problems and by the provision of migrant educational services, social workers, welfare officers, trained contact workers, together with a host of voluntary workers, it does much to reduce the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* The responsibility for this must rest very heavily on the propaganda that is fed to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in their early days in this country when, to my knowledge and that of many honourable members on this side of the House, it is obvious that attempts are made to poison them against Labor's political persuasions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* If the long-standing, theoretical aim of a 1 per cent net population gain of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> intake is to be achieved in the 1970s the gross arrival figures will need to rise above 200,000 almost immediately. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* There is one small problem in a country which by Government policy and by Opposition inclination and otherwise says that it is to some extent interested in decentralisation, and that is that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by and large, despite the good work they do in some areas of agriculture and in some areas of the country, are concentrated in our urban areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* We find, for example, that in my City of Hobart approximately 11 per cent - a relatively low level - of the population are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, roughly half British and half other. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* It will, I presume, tend to obviate some of the difficulties which have arisen in relation to returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, although the studies that have been done on returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, inadequate though they might be in number, suggest that the problems involved and the reasons for return are not nearly as black or as bad as is often painted publicly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* If we increase our selectivity and accent the possibility of integration, which I think is now the new word rather than 'assimilation', of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with the Australia community as we now find it, we will find that those crossroads can be suitably passed and not necessarily in only one direction.

* As it stands, it means that the Government reluctantly has accepted the fact that it has a responsibility to the children, the States and the teachers to provide some finance for the thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have been brought to Australia, but it is confining it to the very minimum and leaving the responsibility for finding additional capital to the States.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0)

* Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of immigration which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated - 1 think the word is now integrated - into the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0)

* There are the question of educating migrant children, the question of the extension and improvement of adult education in one or more parts of the world, and the question of an intensive language course for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> better versed in some skill or other who possibly are already acquainted with the rudiments of the English language and are better able to comprehend an intensive course than are others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0)

* Although approximately one-third of foreign born <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot in any effective way speak English when they get here, the intake in recent years in adult evening education classes conducted, to take one or two examples, has been quite considerably less than the number of current arrivals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0)

* This would appear to be money well spent because we are talking of people who are very likely on a per capita basis to infuse into the community a very considerable contribution not only by their efforts and through their own skills in other areas but also, one would imagine, probably by virtue of the fact of having these skills and being capable of acquiring expression in English - and other languages for that matter - more rapidly are they likely to be leaders of their own communities, insofar as there are communities of new <span class="highlight">migrants</span>.

* 1 am sure that the proposition which I should like to put forward is not novel, but basically there are 4 causes of difficulty for migrant children: Firstly, the question of education in a foreign language; secondly, the question of education in an alien culture; thirdly, the low income of the parents in many cases; and, fourthly, the concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in relatively depressed urban areas with their depressed schools.

* In late 1967 and early 1968 the Department initiated the planning of a major survey of the educational needs of both adult and child <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and this led to the report on the situation of migrant children in schools in New South Wales which has provided such an important basis for the new initiatives for child migrant education.

* To summarise, let us not accept as factual the belief of those people who blame a whole host of modern problems on <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, thereby providing a unique Australian analysis of problems that in fact characterise most advanced industrialised societies, most- of which do not have immigration programmes, anyway, as the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  pointed out.

* questions that probably entered into <span class="highlight">migrants</span>' minds would include the gap in cover between the time of departure from home countries and eligibility under Australian schemes; and the residential requirement before full benefits could apply (e.g., widows' pensions) which had much greater impact on <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than upon Australians generally [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52)

* Although <span class="highlight">migrants</span> comprised 18.3 per cent of Australia's total population, and 25.3 per cent of the total work force in 1966  -  and these proportions are most probably higher today - so far we have avoided any major clashes, the build up of ethnic groups in ghettoes or the development of racial disharmony and tensions in this country.

* As I said earlier, 1 am quite certain that the principles I have outlined will find favour with the large majority of the people of Australia; but, of course, for Australia to abide by and carry out those principles requires the certainty that we have the unfettered right to regulate the intake of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at all times and also have a complete right of selection and rejection.

* One of the defects - by no means the only defect - of the Bill on this subject recently presented to the House by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  - if I may say so, with respect, an incompetent Bill which scarcely reflects the legal talents which one would have expected my honourable and learned friend to have displayed - was that it was entirely confined to 'Australian citizens', and thus constituted a slap in the face for some of the most hard-working and worthy of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>.

* Indeed, this is the principle which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves have endorsed in their journals: They say, very rightly, that those who have earned their pension by their contribution to the Australian scene should, by virtue of that contribution, have the right to take their pension home, lt is for this reason that, with the exceptions for invalids and widows, we have prescribed a qualifying period of 20 years - which is more generous, for example, than what is done in Canada, where the qualifying period is 25 years for portability of the old age security pension.

* It seems to me that this organisation, Travel House of Australia Pty Ltd, in its business practices could very well be blamed for exploiting the position of many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country who, wishing to return to their homes for short term visits, have sought the cheapest means of transport and accordingly used the sort of charter arrangements which organisations like Travel House of Australia seem to be able to provide.

* Measured against this very large settler element in our population and the fact that in the 3 years ended 30th June 1971 Australia received more than half a million <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition retreat into their true perspective.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* But let me say to him at the outset that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia are not offended with the role of the Australian Labor Party or of the Opposition in this Parliament in the migration programme because they recognise that there probably would never have been an immigration programme had it not been initiated by this Party.

* When something like 22,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who came to Australia under assisted passages have returned home within 2 years, there are good reasons why we should look around for the causes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* It seems to me that it would be inappropriate for the simple reason that the Government wanted to engage in a window dressing process in this period preceding the election campaign to give the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> around Australia and those Australians who may be considering living abroad the idea that the Government at last was doing something positive about this question.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Leader of the Opposition attempted to show by citing figures that because the bulk of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries has arrived in Australia only in the last 20 years, therefore they would miss out under the Government's proposal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* Whatever measure we use, the ages of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on arrival in Australia make it quite clear that the overwhelming majority of all settlers in Australia, permanent or long term arrivals, involve people who are under the age of 45 years which would therefore place them in a position to take out the full benefits of the age provision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* One is that through the passage of this legislation and the reciprocal arrangements that will be made with other countries these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia will be provided with a better feeling of equality and status in this country because their own homeland will have negotiated, on an equal footing, a reciprocal agreement with Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* Secondly it will provide encouragement to these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to become more involved in our community because they will feel more a part of it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* Any cost would be more than compensated by the fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have earned this right after having earned their livelihood in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* It will be available to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who may not wish to return to their country of origin but who may wish to go to some other country with which we have a reciprocal agreement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* I believe that it is important both to our country and to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> concerned thai reciprocal agreements be reached with their countries because only by reciprocity can this Government obtain the best deal for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who would wish to move to another country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* So, on the Leader of the Opposition's own figures, one-third of all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia would be deprived of their rights of the Labor Party's Bill which requires citizenship were passed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* The vast majority of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would require at least 20 years after the time they came to Australia before they could qualify, not because of a residential qualification but simply because they have not reached old age. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* The legislation will provide <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with a more equitable basis of portability than the alternative offered by the Labor Party would provide - if anybody can sort out which of the 2 approaches provided by the Labor Party in the last 3 months in this place is the one that it really means. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* This boils down to suggesting that 20 years is appropriate here because we would then be more generous than Canada, or that a 10~year residential requirement would not be enough to deter <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who were interested in coming to Australia for no other reason than to qualify for the age pension.

* Most of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to Australia to seek a new life for their children, as they know that better opportunities exist in Australia, and even though they do not take out Australian citizenship, their children most certainly are Australians, as many have been born here.

* In the postwar period 2.9 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to Australia to seek a new way of life and if it were not for the great work force they provide, we would have less of all those things we consider today to be so essential to our way of life.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* As the Channel Islands have no reciprocal agreement with Britain it means that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from these islands do not qualify for Australian pensions on arrival. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* I know there are other elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia to live with a son or daughter, and who do not qualify for an Australian pension until they have resided here for 10 years, lt is quite obvious that anyone over 80 years of age does not come to Australia just, to receive an Australian pension and then return to his or her country of birth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0)

* I fully support these remarks and emphasise that only when we have fully accepted all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian family, as citizens with equal ranking in all respects, will this desirable goal be achieved.

* To the extent that the departure rate can be reduced by improved selection procedures and through greater attention to the settlement problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, no effort will be.

* The major reasons for the departure of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Australia which have emerged from this report are, as I interpret the interim comments of the Committee, similar to many of those reported by the Committee in 1967. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* The problem of settler loss has to be seen against the contemporary background of world wide high mobility of labour and the steady improvement in economic conditions and social services in a number of countries from which the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* The report points out that there are many factors influencing departure, some of which relate to the general economic and social structure of the country as a whole, and others which are of a personal nature and relate to the particular needs of individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* The report clearly advocates that remedial action concerning the factors which influence the departure of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should take into account the relative importance of these factors.

* I would ask the Minister to consider making a ministerial statement which would set out the full details of the new Government's approach to immigration, the basic principles which it is following, the determining factors which influence the total number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which the Government intends to seek to bring to Australia this year and their impact upon the whole migrant program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* As the Minister for Immigration, I stated that <span class="highlight">migrants</span>' contributions to Australia's economic growth are important by any standards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* Consistent with this philosophy, the previous Government extended and intensified - on a continuing basis - the training of migration officers to better equip them to counsel and advise prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* In addition, the Opposition parties will be submitting positive and constructive proposals and we hope that those initiatives when put to the House will be seriously examined by the Minister in no sense on party political comment but in the context of what can best be done in this country for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the extension of migrant welfare services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* The Minister's commendable desire to stem the departure rate of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is presumably based on the belief that Australia remains reliant upon a continuing level of migration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* The fact that the migrant program is now to be based upon the sponsorship by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already living in Australia is in our judgment a retrograde decision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* The Government's policy apparently assumes that the sum total of the individual wishes of relatives of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will always equal the sum total of Australia's migration needs.

* The former Government combined 2 processes in its immigration program - sponsorship programs designed to encourage family reunion and actively seeking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under government sponsorsip to fulfil those needs not met by family sponsorship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0)

* It is important, in the context of the findings of the report tabled by the Minister, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from these countries should not be confronted by a number of governmentcreated problems clearly associated with the trend in departure rates of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>.

* I give the assurance to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and to the House generally that this Government will take action to see to it that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come before our courts, are convicted and have records that put them within the provisions of deportation will not remain in our midst. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0)

* As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has raised the question of the status of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in our community, I place on record in this House that since World War II more than 3 million people have come to this country and the overwhelming majority of them have been great citizens.

* It is understandable that some Yugoslav <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of Croatian origin should continue to hope for the establishment of an independent Croatia and within a democracy like Australia they have a right to advocate their views so long as they do so by legitimate means.

* We should not abandon our democratic principles of free speech, belief and association but I would hope that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are left with no misunderstanding of the disfavour with which the Government would view  any activities which might reasonably give rise to objections by the present governments of their countries of origin.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0)

* The position is that the greatest slur that has been cast on the migrant community in Australia has been cast upon it by the handful of people who have brought discredit on all of the community by their acts of violence and by their law breaking, and this is resented by the vast majority of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who resent being associated with people who are criminals.

* I had not only authorised, but directed, the Attorney-General from his first week in office to do what his predecessors conspicuously failed to do - to follow up departmental and ministerial reports on the growth of terrorist activities in Australia and the threat that they represented not only to all Australians but to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in particular and to our relations with a country with which we have had unbroken relations since 1918 and of which we have been an ally in 2 wars.

* But we already know that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> contribute proportionately more to the workforce than they do to the population supported by that workforce, that they include a substantial proportion of skilled and other key workers, that the great majority receive all their educational and vocational training prior to coming here and, therefore, at no cost to Australia and that they contribute particularly to the maintenance and development of key industries and services.

* Examination of this shows that it reflects the lower proportion of refugees in current immigration - that is, refugees tend to stay more than other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - the greater ease of travel in recent years, the strong economic attraction of western Europe, and the growing number of skilled and highly qualified persons who, as part of an increasingly mobile international community, often move from Australia after a few years.

* It does underscore one of the basic reasons why people return to their mother country and reminds the House that one of the reasons for bringing in this social security Bill is a recognition that we must update and improve our social security and provide better value for each dollar spent on it so that it can stand comparison with the social security systems in the countries from which most of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22)

* The Committee concludes that, while there is an increasing tendency for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to leave Australia, this is in keeping with patterns of movement which were already in evidence during the previous inquiry and which conform with those being experienced currently by other migrant receiving countries throughout the world.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0)

* Can we wonder that some British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have looked a little wistfully at our citizenship ceremonies and have wondered why they were not encouraged to participate in an oath or affirmation of allegiance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0)

* This Bill, which will amend the Citizenship Act, demonstrates how seriously we regard our citizenship and how warmly we welcome <span class="highlight">migrants</span> free from the indignities of special inducements.

* That Australia welcomes all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as candidates for citizenship under common and uniform conditions for all countries will, I know, appeal to an inbuilt British sense of justice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0)

* This means that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all the 31 Commonwealth countries will now have the same opportunity as other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take part in citizenship ceremonies suitably marking the important occasion of their becoming citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* This conjures up a picture of tens of thousands of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seriously disaffected because they do not have the privilege of being naturalised at a naturalisation ceremony and, instead, are seriously discriminated against by being able to acquire citizenship by registration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* Mesmerised by the Minister's words, people are not aware that his actions have seriously reduced the supply of good quality British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of European origin, that the composition of our immigration program has changed rapidly so that there no longer is a predominance of people from western Europe, Britain and North America of European descent arriving in Australia under the program; that the proportion of people with skills and professional qualifications has fallen and given way to people who have no other qualification than a relative in Australia who is prepared to sponsor them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* Indeed, the fact that we have been able, largely successfully, to digest a migrant intake in the post-war years that is proportionately greater than that of any other country in history, or modern history anyway, is due to one cardinal feature of every migration program in every year since 1945, that is, that the proportion of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> has never fallen below 50 per cent of the total and in many years has been considerably above it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* Having said something about the proposals in the Bill to make it more difficult for people from Britain to become citizens of Australia let me say something about the provisions designed to make it easier for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from every country other than Britain to become Australian citizens.

* They include inequalities between pre-school children, depending upon whether they live in the Australian Capital Territory or in the various States; inequalities between our children, depending upon which school they attend; inequalities between men and women; inequalities between the wage earner and the prices setter, inequalities between the electors in the State electorates and particularly in Commonwealth electorates, depending upon the electorate in which they leave; inequalities between <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, depending upon the country of their origin; inequalities between overseas visitors and more particularly between <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, depending upon the country of origin; and, of course, inequalities between applicants who seek eligibility for citizenship under the terms of the Act enforced by the previous Government - the Act which this Bill seeks to amend.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* The point is - the Minister has lost sight of this - that the previous Government was not practising discrimination against nonUnited Kingdom <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because it applied a different time factor for qualifying for naturalisation to the non-British migrant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0)

* The previous Government was recognising that the United Kingdom migrant, who had come from a country with a Westminster system of Parliament and practices a way of life this country has followed, was more easily able to assimilate to the Australian way of fife than were many non-British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who, after 3 years in this country, perhaps could not even speak the English language.

* But despite this, the Department is insisting that instruction not only for adolescent and older <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, including those who will hardly be involved in the wider spheres of community life because they are confined to the home, but also for children, should be by the situation method as though the study of language or the proper use of words can be divorced from the study of the history and literature that produced those words.

* In many inner city suburbs where there are large families, where often 2 parents are working or where large concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are living, it is essential to provide satisfactory pre-school centres staffed by adequately trained teachers who can apply themselves to problems which face these young people.

* If we are merely looking for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> also because we feel there is something wrong with the numbers situation as it exists in Australia at the moment and we would like to have growth patterns because growth patterns are part of the conventional wisdom, I think we are deluding ourselves.

* But at the moment the Government is demanding that the States spend less money and reduce their rates of expenditure, which does not seem to me to offer a great prospect for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> receiving the sorts of assistance which would be required if they are to be brought into Australia and accommodated as they are entitled to be if we are bringing them into the country for our benefit rather than for their benefit.

* In addition, because of the present difficult economic and employment situation in Australia, immigration programs have been decreased significantly to a point where the 52 748 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving in 1975-76 represented the lowest intake since 1947 .

* It is not merely Australia's decision that we will have a net increase in settlement of 20 000, 40 000, 60 000 or 100 000 and that these people will come from the same countries as our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> came from between 1945 and 1975.

* It is said- I think this is the grave error that was made by the Labor Party and accepted by this Governmentthat when there is unemployment the level of migration must be cut because the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will compete for jobs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1)

* If <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are brought in it will add immediately to the labour force difficulties, but if <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not brought in it will add to the labour force difficulties in the following year because there will be no markets, there will be a lack of growth in industry and there will be no employment available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1)

* I say this in the face of the undoubted fact that, over the very short term, the entrance of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> competing for jobs exacerbates the immediate unemployment position.

* The crucial question for policy making is whether we accept that target figure and adjust our policies to it or whether we accept 16 million people as a base which can be increased quite substantially by a deliberate immigration policy of allowing in up to 20 million or even more new <span class="highlight">migrants</span>.

* My remarks will no doubt raise the ire of some opposite and some who are listening to this debate, but I regard it as a matter of tragedy that, quite apart from those whom we are inviting to come to Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> one in three or one in five, depending on what statistics one takes into account, of Australian pregnancies are terminated.

* I believe that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in cooperation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  should be giving much deeper thought to the need to lift from 14 per cent the intake of Asian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and should have regard to the need to bring people from Oceania.

* I rise this evening to point up once again the hypocrisy of the Government in the way in which it deals so blithely with migrant problems, particularly in some of the areas represented by honourable members on the Government side, who day after day pay lip service to what they say they do in the interests of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in their community.

* Here we have the absurd situation of the Federal Government paying lip service, through the great harangues we heard tonight, to the population policy inquiry report while on the other hand there is a cut in Budget expenditure which has relegated the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are now here, and ignoring those who arrive in the near future, to second class citizens destined for the major part to spend the rest of their lives at the end of a pick and shovel.

* When it is revealed that 30 per cent of the 5656 unemployed in Wollongong are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it will obviously give very grave cause for concern. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4)

* If Wollongong has been ignored in the placement of these machines, it would be a continuation of this Government's lack of interest in the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have arrived in Australia and especially a lack of interest in the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Wollongong.

* Although the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in stating a policy on immigration and population, is laying the groundwork for bringing more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into this country, the Government cannot take adequate care of the people in the country at the present time.

* The Government has also transferred the office of Commissioner for Community Relations, which Labor set up, into the area of the Attorney-General's Department where legalism is likely to become the order of the day rather than the compassionate, ombudsman type of operation which is necessary to deal with the real and continuing needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>.

* One of the other areas of the Bill which seems to me to have a degree of unreality is that, it could be for instance, that the British Government would seek in Australia from British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are still British citizens recruits for the British armed forces.

* Because of the over-generous conditions under which Australian pensions are paid to pensioners going abroad, the conclusion of these reciprocal arrangements is of far greater interest and importance to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> resident in Australia than to those who after a short stay here have left the country.

* <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> would have been better served if they had been given entitlement to pensions after, say, 3 years residence in Australia so long as they continue to live in this country and if portability of pension entitlement had been granted to those who leave Australia permanently only if they had spent considerably longer periods of their working lives in Australia than the 10 years residence which now applies.

* The point is that we cannot just seek to push for our own development in this selfish fashion, recognising that we have a lot of unemployed that we cannot accommodate, that we have an increasing aged population, that somehow they will have to survive on social welfare and that we will have to maintain our own productive sections of the community by bringing in trained <span class="highlight">migrants</span>.

* As I have said previously, in the short term we have problems with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country because of our situation here, but in the long term we must program for many more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come here to help us develop this country and to hold it.

* The ideas are good but in actual financial terms, if my understanding of the promises of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  is correct, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are going to receive less, not more, than they received this financial year, unless the Government changes the promise stated by the Prime Minister and incorporates a factor to take into account inflation.

* I might say, because this is a cognate debate, that for the chronically ill, the poor in our community, the family man and his wife and children, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the Aboriginals that the changes being made by the Government to the system that has operated for the last 18 months or two years represents a retrograde step and will save only approximately 1.5 per cent of total medical costs.

* It was the present Government which saw the need to establish a separate Department of Immigration with which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would establish contact initially and which would continue to provide a special contact point for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their subsequent settlement in Australia.

* On the other hand this Government reintroduced the Department of Immigration and expanded it to include ethnic affairs, a recognition of the fact that the Government does not see <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as being just workers but rather as people with a unique and cultural heritage which we should encourage them to foster as they become Australian citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I do not doubt the work done by the committee and I acknowledge the courtesy with which one is received when one makes an inquiry, but the fact is that when <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come to see a member of parliament and talk about one of their relatives whom they wish to see migrate to Australia and who they say has a particular skill in some area, they produce the certificates of that qualification or copies of them from some overseas school or institution and it is the devil's own job to find out whether that qualification is accepted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* One of the things that is spoken about in this paper is the fact that at the bottom of the trade cycle when there is an excess capacity immigration in the first instance tends to use up only that excess capacity, so the increased demand from the new immigrants will not add so much to employment levels and, therefore, may add to unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* The direct effect of immigration for two decades (that is, excluding the inflows from Australian born children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>) was to contribute at least 40 per cent of the annual increase in the Australian labour force: Indeed in the 1950s the contribution would have been in excess of 50 per cent per year.

* Along with its medical research activities, the newlyestablished Migrant Health Unit within the Commonwealth Department of Health, with the co-operation of health authorities in the States and Territories, is building up a comprehensive picture of health information currently available to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so that the gaps can be plugged.

* Realising that, however, really it is not such a great increase in expenditure, particularly when one bears in mind that as a condition of the Government's accepting this proposal it withdrew the right of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to claim as tax deductions the funds that they send overseas to maintain their dependants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1)

* In the coming year there will be expenditure of $ 15m but, given the fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are losing the sum that I have mentioned- $20m- that is a profit to the Government of $5m.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1)

* Once again, and taking that factor into account, we find that the expenditure on services for the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that we expect to arrive is far less than it ought to be.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1)

* But, of course, again given that we have had this problem- that is how we have looked at it- of immigrants to this country for many more years than the last two or three and even longer than the three years that the Labor Government was in power, far too little has been done and far too little is being done at this stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1)

* There must be at least 20,000 adults who would like to have tuition in English, but we have provided for a magnificent total of 8,000 unless, of course, the effect of the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System is to ensure that mainly English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are selected to come to the country.

* Even 1 1,000 this year is a long way from what I think the figure probably ought to be unless, as I say, we have managed with NUMAS to tip the balance so that most of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming here now speak English which is possible.

* When we come to the 48 special project grants, which were offered to encourage self help among ethnic groups and to help trade unions in providing welfare services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, with a total expenditure of $ 1 50,000, this sounds good.

* -I refer the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to an explanation he gave on 30 August this year in which he said that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia fell into four categories- family reunion, refugees, those entering by virtue of the Tasman agreement and persons who were selected because of their occupational skills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0)

* In view of the high unemployment level amongst recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, will the Minister confirm that, under the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System selection process, persons who fall into this last migrant category are still being selected primarily because of labour market demand for their skills? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0)

* That is continuing; but, under the NUMAS scheme, there is flexibility which allows the entry to Australia of people who score particularly well under the NUMAS selection system; those are outstanding <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who may have occupations which are outside those classified in the information given to my Department by other Commonwealth departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0)

* Taken together, these charges imposed on visitors and would-be visitors to Australia and on temporary residents in the country will recoup more than the funds provided for the migrant communities via Galbally expenditure when one takes into account the disallowance as an income tax deduction of funds sent overseas to dependants of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country.

* Briefly, I indicated at that time that many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are naturalised Australians, or in some cases their children who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their countries of birth, or of their parents' birth, still to be citizens of those countries.

* This decision not only discriminates against resident <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seeking to bring additional family members to Australia, but ensures that many people approved under NUMAS for settlement in Australia as independent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be pushed to the end of the ever growing dole queues.
