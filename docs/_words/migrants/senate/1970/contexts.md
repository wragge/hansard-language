* The reason given by the Minister for the reduced appropriation for the United Kingdom-Australia Assisted Passage Agreement was that last year 68,000 British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arrived in Australia while this year we -are planning for 60,000, a reduction of 8,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66)

* The reason given for the reduction in the appropriation for the Inter-governmental Committee for European Migration-Passage and associated costs for refugee migration was that last year we had 15,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from this source - mostly Yugoslavs - and this year the number will be reduced to 10,000.

* In sub-division 3- Other Services - which includes the appropriation for Commonwealth Hostels Ltd, the Good Neighbour Councils and the International Social Service, services which we offer to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, we are increasing the appropriation to the extent of $336,232 to offer <span class="highlight">migrants</span> greater services.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* This means that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all the 31 Commonwealth countries will now have the same opportunity as other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take part in citizenship ceremonies suitably marking the important occasion of their becoming citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* But - and this is another point which I suggest might arouse some concern in the Government ranks - the reason for this Bill is the Government's legitimate, wholly justified and, may I say, completely necessary desire to allay the fears of a number of people that they may be deported, lt is entirely proper for the Government to wish to allay these fears for it has been the Australian Labor Party Government which over the past 4 or 5 months has aroused in the minds of a considerable number of the 2 million or more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country the fear that some of them may be deported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* However, the Review concluded that because the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have changed since the councils were established, and because it is not possible to revise the councils' functions so that they do not duplicate or inhibit the role of the ethnic communities, there is no justification for continued Commonwealth Government funding of the councils.
