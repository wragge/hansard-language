[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19)

* Of course, the co-operation would be the same no matter from which party the  Chairman  of Committees was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, but, this friendship, this co-operation, this liaison between the principal officer of the Parliament, the  Speaker,  and his  deputy,  the  Chairman  of Committees, is very important.

* I really do not think that one is <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees to be a comedian; I think one is <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees to conduct the affairs of the House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19)

* I suppose the honourable member will be praying for it to stop so that there might be the kind of conditions that members opposite hope might get them <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the government of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0)

* So the first point that I make is that I do not believe that the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  realises how necessary it is, if matters such as these are to be considered effectively, that those who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House following the last election should have the chance to debate these pieces of legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12)

* In these circumstances, I do not believe it is reasonable to expect that the people of Australia and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of this House would be content to believe that there could be adequate debate of the legislation which is before us in the time proposed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12)

* It is important that the Australian people should recognise that a party which is supposedly dedicated to the abolition of the Senate - for that is what its policy says - is forcing debate of these piece of legislation from this, the principal <span class="highlight">elected</span> chamber of the Parliament, into the other chamber. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12)

* The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0)

* It would appear then to be more just to have an even number <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time for each Territory, thus allowing the representation of the parties to be more evenly balanced than would be the case if only one senator for each Territory were provided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0)

* Under the provisions of the Bill, after the first election of Territory senators, both senators for each Territory will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time there is a general election of the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0)

* Indeed, given the propensity that this Government has for allowing full and adequate debate in the Senate it could well be that, if we were to pass this piece of legislation, the situation could develop whereby those -who are senators or part-senators from the Territories would have a greater opportunity to discuss significant pieces of legislation affecting the wellbeing of the Australian people than those who are their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in this chamber. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0)

* In other words, what the Labor Party is seeking to do is to have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate people who will not be given the same opportunity to express a point of view as other senators because they are to be constricted in their voting rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0)

* This is a new Parliament with 17 new members in this House - democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by more than 500,000 people on 18 May - who will be denied the opportunity to debate this fantastically important issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20)

* I should like to remind him that this is a House of Parliament democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> and by this tactic the Government is denying the rights of every member of this House, including the 17 new ones, to talk about an issue that affects every Australian now living and every Australian to be born. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20)

* Yet we are told - not only members on this side of the House but also the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Labor Party members - like little children in primary school that we must conclude all our arguments on this momentous issue in just 2 hours. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20)

* In dealing with these aspects, I am conscious that I am repeating some of the arguments made by myself and other speakers in the December debate but, unlike the Government, we recognise that this is a new Parliament and that there are <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people here who have not necessarily heard those arguments or been allowed to participate in them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20)

* I think that when we talk about adequate parliamentary debate we are talking about discussion sufficient to air the issues, discussion sufficient to clarify any issues which require clarification for the public, and discussion adequate to allow the topic before the House to go into the community as well so that some feedback can come to <span class="highlight">elected</span> members in this place.

* I had handed to me by the Federal  President  of the Australian Medical Association this afternoon what I would describe as an ultimatum on behalf of most of the private practice doctors in the Australian Capital Territory, not acting as a union on behalf of people who are negotiating conditions of employment but as a body delivering an ultimatum saying that they refuse the right of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of this country or indeed any authority in the Australian Capital Territory to increase the public sector of health care in this community.

* The purpose of this Bill is to establish a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory consisting of 19 members to replace the present Legislative Council comprised of 1 1 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members and 6 official members.

* Recent events affecting the operation of this Parliament have made it necessary for the Government to proceed with this Bill as a matter of priority in these sittings so that elections might be held on that date and the Government's undertaking to give the people of the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature by the end of this year, might be kept.

* The timing of the introduction of that Bill into the House - which will ensure that members will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 24 October so that there can be a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly before the end of December this year - hinged on the statement of policy that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  made off the top of his head that that would be so.

* Anyone who knows anything about the Northern Territory knows that that date for having a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly - by that 1 mean one with executive authority and not just 19 men milling around the Assembly chamber with no policy, no leadership, no means of introducing government business, no means of asking questions and no government member in there at all - makes a farce of the Committee and of the Bill.

* If there is to be in the Northern Territory an <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature with 19 or 20 members - it does not matter how many - it must assume responsibility for determining the priorities for expenditure and some responsibility for raising the revenue, or at least some of the revenue, to meet those priorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Committee, prior to the double dissolution, was half way through taking evidence and completing an important report which was to contain recommendations to the Parliament on the setting up of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council in the Northern Territory and the powers which should be exercised by it.

* To make it clear to those honourable members who may not be so interested, let me say that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in his usual desire to honour his promises to the Aus tralian people, stated in his pre-election speech in 1972 that by the end of 1974 the Northern Territory would have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0)

* It is not so long ago that a majority of the members of the Australian Labor Party had to convince important sections of the Austraiian community, including tens of thousands who took part in Vietnam moratorium demonstrations, including hundreds of thousands who supported what were called 'political strikes', that despite 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule they had not been disfranchised; that it was still possible for Labor Party governments to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>; that when Labor Party governments were <span class="highlight">elected</span> they would be given the same opportunities as the Liberal Party governments which preceded them; that they would have the same opportunities to put their policies into effect; that they would have the same protection from the conventions as the governments that preceded them.

* The Victorian Parliament, controlled by members of the Liberal Party, has since 196 1 consistently passed special legislation in order to circumvent the Constitution of that State, which requires that the Upper House should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a different time to the lower House, in order that conjoint elections can take place.

* As I have already said, because of the proportional representation method that is used to elect senators in this country- and my colleague the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  has already pointed out that there are only ever 6 senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a half senate election situation, the other 24 being in effect appointed by their various political parties- the Senate for ever more will be evenly balanced.

* It is a House which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by universal franchise; it is a House which has a built in equality of State representation; and it is a House which, by reason of developments in recent years, is adopting for itself a role quite separate and distinct from the role of upper houses of the various States that make up the Australian Federation.

* By what rule of common sense do we approve of a situation in which these elections are held at different times and people elect a House of Representatives- the House that they think is the Government- and then have that Government's will thwarted and frustrated by the members of a chamber which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> at different times from members of the House of Representatives and half of whose members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a different time from the other half of its members.

* It may be influenced by the federal or unitary nature of the constitution and whether it is written or unwritten, by the legislative procedure in Parliament, by the ease with which parliamentary time can be found to effect amendments in the law which concern only a small minority of citizens, by the extent to which Parliament has been in the habit of intervening to reverse judicial decisions by legislation; but most of all by the underlying political philosophy of the particular nation as to the appropriate limits of the lawmaking function of a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> judiciary.

* The important aspect about this provision is that, by the Constitution of Australia, the will of the people, if we wish to put it in those terms, is expressed in this vacuum of a casual vacancy by the Houses of the Parliament of the State constituted by the individuals <span class="highlight">elected</span> to those Houses by the constitutional processes of that State, and those Houses of the Parliament then have entrusted to them in aU the acts that they perform the expression of the Will of the people.
