* 1 believe that the purposes of the Committee in examining regulations and ordinances are, first, to see that there is no arbitrary exercise of discretion by the Executive - that undue discretionary powers are not given to it; secondly, to see that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the subject are not unnecessarily interfered with; thirdly, that matters which should properly be dealt with by legislation are not included in regulations and ordinances; fourthly - I believe this is a very important point which does attract the attention of the Committee - that if there are circumstances where the Commit tee believes that any of these matters have arisen, they should be of sufficient substance to warrant a resolution from the Committee that the regulation or ordinance not be accepted by the Senate.

* It has been argued - I think with some justice - that if a person does not wish to exercise the present <span class="highlight">rights</span> he has under the National Service Act for classification as a conscientious objector, and if he is prepared to take the consequences which follow for a person who refuses to comply with the Act, he should be entitled to refuse to comply with the Act subject to his taking the consequences of that refusal.

* The other - perhaps more substantially material - infringement of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> would follow if this were to have the consequence that were he to change his mind, not about his conscientious objection but about his particular objection to the operation of the Act, and if he desired at some later date to make an application to be classified as a conscientious objector, the previous finding of the court that he was not a conscientious objector would prejudice any subsequent application he may make.

* Certainly if the decision which was reached in Perth is to be regarded as a proper decision within the terms of the Act, then clearly the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of an individual are very severely interfered with because the Act enables a court to come to a decision without any evidence having been given by anyone.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-49-0)

* in reply - In dealing with these 2 Bills, the Superannuation Bill and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Bill, we have been reminded by those who have spoken in the Senate that the 2 Bills have a joint purpose, that is, to enable officers either coming to or going from these schemes to carry with them certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> with regard to superannuation.

* But when we have matters undoubtedly of considerable principle, undoubtedly of important changes in the law which effect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens in the enforcement sphere, which concern the judicial branch of government, I think it is fair to say that this should not be left to the Executive.

* Because this Ordinance does purport merely to collate in many respects existing law that is otherwise contained in the statutes, particularly in the statutes of the State of New South Wales; because there is fluidity in the approach to the whole of this question; because of the assurance of the Attorney-General that he is conscious that, even though it is not a body of substantive law, it does to an extent impinge upon the statement of <span class="highlight">rights</span> that it may quite properly find its place in the statutes; because he has that within his contemplation at the appropriate time; and because of the practical difficulties that may be associated with the destruction of this Ordinance and the resurrection of the multitude of laws otherwise applying, with their confusions and complexities, 1 feel that prudence dictates that this Ordinance be allowed to live.

* In considering this matter, it was noted that the Senate has already referred a cognate matter to the Privileges Committee, with a view to establishing the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, responsibilities, obligations and protection of senators, members of the Press and others in relation to Committee proceedings.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0)

* In this way the Privileges Committee would be a body which at least could look into matters without any occasion of complaint of breach and it would be able to say that this is the way in which some matter should be conducted, these are the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, these are the responsibilities and these are the protections.

* To push this legislation through in the teeth of our opposition, our assertions and our feelings that it is eroding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those persons whom the Australian Labor Party represents, is not the way in which affairs ought to be dealt with by a House of review. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* Since  Senator Murphy  has dealt at some length with what he refers to as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of unionists, maybe it is appropriate that in stating my part of the case of the Australian Democratic Labor Party I should outline the principles upon which we would judge this legislation.

* Secondly, union organisation, as such, should not be weakened by legislation not merely because it is an expression of the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of wage earners but because it is the necessary foundation of the conciliation and arbitration system.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* As we see the position, the Bill can be divided into 4 fields: Firstly, matters related to the constitutional position of unions concerning questions which could, in the case of a number of unions, go to their very existence; secondly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of rank and file unionists within the unions; thirdly, amendments to the structure and procedure of the conciliation and arbitration system; fourthly, the question of sanctions and the responsibility of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* However, to the extent that the Bill does promote measures to assist in preserving unions from the constitutional challenges of the Moore v.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* Basically the philosphy of the current and previous governmentsin relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the Government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members or groups of members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* Not only is the Government insincere in respect of the democratic control of the trade union movement; it can also be shown and will it be shown by Opposition speakers that the main aim of the Government is to weaken the capacity of the trade union movement to defend its <span class="highlight">rights</span> and its members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* In the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill the Government is saying that trade unions, as corporate bodies, should be subject to certain government interference and certain government supervision, so that the members of the organisations shall have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> protected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* When we consider the application of that principle cross the board and see the manner in which it is applied to one of the largest organisations in Australia - I am led to believe that this position is somewhat similar to that of organisations in other States and the Hospitals Contribution Fund of New South Wales - we see that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the members of the organisation are deliberately restricted by its rules. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* So I find it somewhat hypocritical of the Government to say that it is concerned with democracy and with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of trade unions, when the members of these important organisations, which are concerned with the medical and hospital <span class="highlight">rights</span> of contributors, have no say in the running of the organisations.

* I envisage that people who hold the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of insurance companies dear, people who believe that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States should not be impinged on in any way, will find plenty to object to in a proposition like this.

* If, on the other hand, the Government and the Parliament adopt recommendations of a similar nature to those recommended for New Zealand but decide that the benefits should be in addition to and not in substitution for existing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, again the Commonwealth employees will be delayed in the enjoyment of those benefits without any justification.

* If a New Zealand type scheme, an egalitarian scheme which must necessarily provide lower benefits than some which are granted by the courts, especially in common law at the present time - it is surely not suggested that at this stage Australia could afford to pay to every member of the community the type of monetary compensation that is awarded in actions for damages - is adopted and becomes law, not only will the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits of Commonwealth employees be affected and go into the melting pot but also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all citizens of Australia who happen to be unlucky enough to incur personal injury will be affected.

* It may be pertinent to inquire of the Minister whether any plan is in hand that might take the opportunity which exists under the Commonwealth Electoral Act away from British people, because it could be assumed that the measures in the Bill that is before, the Senate today may find a reflection in another Bill which may also reduce the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of British Commonwealth citizens.

* The reason for these rules of construction (for which see, for example, Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 11th Ed., at 204 and 205) is that retrospective legislation affecting substantial <span class="highlight">rights</span> is regarded as likely to be unjust or unfair. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0)

* The law has always taken the view that, although the legislature has full power to change <span class="highlight">rights</span> retrospectively, it will not ordinarily do so because of the possible injustice involved and Statutes have invariably been construed accordingly.

* Whatever the precise legal characterisation of the situation may be, it seems to me to be fair to describe a situation where a company which under the law had no obligation to pay a particular tax becomes obligated by a change in the law to pay $95,000 in tax as one where there has been a substantial alteration of the company's <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* This therefore seems to me to be the kind of legislation which is properly characterised as retrospective and which may fairly be thought to suffer from the defect of retrospective legislation in that it unsettles existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and disturbs the legitimate expectation of taxpayers that once a particular set of conditions has been laid down as governing taxability for a particular year, that set of conditions will not be changed.

* The condemnation by the present Minister of this organisation and his court action against the organisation arose from rules which were against the common <span class="highlight">rights</span> or the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of its members and took the control of the organisation out of the membership of the organisation and put it in the hands of some hierarchy.

* Basically, the philosophy of the current and previous governments in relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members or groups of members.

* Therefore, to select a group of people in this community who can be adversely affected by the proposed law when their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are already, in one case, in the process of litigation and, in other cases, where the Commonwealth itself has, as far as I have been able to ascertain, by its own laches been instrumental in delaying the acquisition of and payment of compensation for property is to discriminate against these people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0)

* In the midst of them this legislation was introduced which gravely imperils and even destroys the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which people would have enjoyed under the existing law to compensation under the terms that then applied. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0)

* If the Commonwealth has been, as its own instance, responsible for delays or if the processes were so cumbersome that it was impossible to have the proceedings finalised within that time, I think it must accept the responsibility and that it should not deny to the person whose land it intends to resume the <span class="highlight">rights</span> he would have enjoyed under the existing law.

* Therefore, both for the reason which  Senator Withers  advanced that in one case there is litigation actually in being and <span class="highlight">rights</span> are still in the process of determination and because of the series of other cases where the quantum of compensation is still a matter for negotiation and consideration and where certain formal steps have taken place over a number of years, it does not appear just or proper that the Commonwealth should intervene by way of this legislation and truncate, deny or circumscribe <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* A party that did not oppose this Bill would be wanting in principle, and a party that would initiate a Bill of this sort should be thoroughly condemned, especially when that party has spokesmen who parade through the country the idea that people 's <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be preserved by a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and a reform of administrative processes, and that individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are arbitrarily invaded should be recompensed.

* The second is that without blushing at all those people who sat spuriously in Opposition some 8 or 10 years ago when I raised the question of the inequity of invading litigants' <span class="highlight">rights</span> after they had been before the law courts in the IPEC case- I have not looked to the debates but I can bring them all to mind- held up their hands in horror and said: 'What a monstrous thing it is that the litigant should be deprived of his right to appeal to the Privy Council '.

* The last thing that I put in by way of a sweet postscript to the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  is that if I were more ignorant and more gullible I would thank him for the grace and favour that he has tended in clause 6 of the Bill, where, having invaded these <span class="highlight">rights</span> and applied an exceptional formula to specified people, discriminating against them, he is good enough to say: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* Let me say at once that the Government gladly accepts the inclusion in this Bill of the extract from the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> from which the former Minister for Education and Science, the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has quoted, embodying, as it does very thoroughly, the philosophy and statement of faith on which the legislation before the House rests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* It is taken straight from Article 26, paragraph 3 of the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* In view of the further fact that the Attorney-General and Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  this afternoon introduced into the chamber a Bill for the total incorporation of the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> into the statute law of Australia, I cannot imagine for a moment that the Government has any intention to oppose this amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* But I do know that it provides for the incorporation of the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> into Australian law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* Further, I point out that the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in this respect embodies a principle which I think has been accepted as an important principle, namely to avoid the possibility that there could develop in a country- one hopes that it should never be a fear in Australia- political indoctrination and the opportunity for the political education of children, where steps are taken which would mean that children were not obtaining the type of education which they or their parents might wish them to have. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* I propose to the Temporary Chairman that having referred to this question of the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>- the amendment to insert a new paragraph (a) into clause  13-1  should later deal with the other proposed new paragraphs one by one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* The third amendment which we would suggest is that regard should be had to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and powers pursuant to the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of the State governments in relation to education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* For that reason I prefer what  Senator Rae  supports which is, in effect, that we regard all the children of this country as having equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and we give each of them justice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* Those who go to one school will have prior <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the Government will have a primary obligation to look after them while those who go to other schools will come second and receive what is left over. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* My final point is that the United Nations Charter of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> states, as  Senator Rae  has pointed out, that the parent has the right to decide the school his child will attend. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* How can a charter of that nature be incorporated in the legislation of this country when the Government has a provision in its education legislation which contradicts the Charter on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* I believe that the Labor Party has made a grave mistake in once again putting forward this proposition that some children in the community have prior <span class="highlight">rights</span> to others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* Therefore, it is altogether fitting that a piece of legislation such as this should give effect to the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, which spells out in principle the very things that  Senator Mulvihill  was underlining with some effect.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0)

* I think it is farcical to talk about a civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill and a civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> debate when the Commonwealth Government and the New South Wales Government are equally at fault by permitting their police forces to commit the gravest infringement of the ordinary civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people living in this country.

* In the past 10 years the question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> became the most important issue in Aboriginal affairs- as important for the urban Aboriginals of the south and east as it was for those in the north who still live in or near their traditional territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* In relation to land the convention states that: The right of ownership, collective or individual, of the members of the populations concerned over the lands which these populations traditionally occupy shall be recognised and; no government in Australia had recognised any Aboriginal right of ownership of land, other than the ordinary <span class="highlight">rights</span> of aboriginals as citizens to own land like any other person. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* In doing so, they have shown scant regard for any <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the land, legal or moral, of the Aboriginal people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* These are the simple historical facts which provide the background for the Government's expressed intention to recognise Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the most appropriate way possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* The significance of the judgment of  Mr Justice  Blackburn in the Northern Territory Supreme Court in 1971 was that it made it perfectly clear that if Aboriginals were to obtain land <span class="highlight">rights</span> it would have to be by an Act of Government and not through the courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* The campaign for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> conducted by Aboriginal organisations and their supporters in the 1960s did not lack enthusiasm and the justice of the cause should have been apparent to all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* But those involved did not really provide governments with any adequate indication of how land <span class="highlight">rights</span> might properly be recognised and granted to the Aboriginal people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* This Australian Government has not only acknowledged that the Aboriginal people were effectively the owners of the whole of this continent before the first white settlement but has expressed its determination to recognise in practical ways their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* The Government therefore appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the problems and advise it on: 'The appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to <span class="highlight">rights</span> in or in relation to land'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* The report proposes, in brief, that full ownership <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the reserves and certain other lands should be vested in appropriate groups of Aboriginal trustees, holding title on behalf of the traditional owners of the land in Aboriginal law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* It is envisaged that they would continue, with their own staff and independent funding, in order to negotiate on land matters and generally to guard Aboriginal interests and traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* The report recommends that <span class="highlight">rights</span> to minerals in Aboriginal lands should remain with the Government with 2 very important qualifications. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* In effect Aboriginals would enjoy most of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of owners of minerals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* We do not intend to put pressure on the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory to accept the recommendations in haste but at the same time we do not wish to see any undue delay in implementing policy which will at last give Aboriginals some <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the land of their ancestors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* I should stress that this is a report about landabout traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and ways of recognising these and about land needs and ways of meeting them whether in towns and cities or in reserves, pastoral properties and vacant lands. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0)

* It is interesting to note that it was a government of our persuasion which legislated to give the member for the Northern Territory full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* If we are to believe the hoary stories of the Opposition if a person born and bred in Sydney or Cairns were to shift to the Northern Territory or to Canberra, he would be denied certain of his democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> which he would have had if he had remained in the State of his birth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Bill has a very simple objective; it seeks to give the residents of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of representation in this place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* I draw to the attention of honourable senators the fact that it was not so many years ago that the representative for the Australian Capital Territory and the representative for the Northern Territory had limited <span class="highlight">rights</span> even in the House of Representatives, but as the evolution has taken place those representatives have been recognised as full members of the Parliament and are now able to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> on all matters that come before the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* We are seeking to extend this right in order to give the residents of the Territories who have particular and different problems the <span class="highlight">rights</span> enjoyed by every other person in the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Legislative Council in the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council and more recently, I understand, even the conference of the Liberal Party in the Australian Capital Territory have seen fit to support the proposition that the people in the Territories should be regarded as having equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this place with every other Australian. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The argument seems to be that by allowing the senators for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to have equal votes with existing senators who claim to represent the States, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those States would be reduced disproportionately. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* This chamber would be seriously undermined as the protector of States <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The alternative is to wait for another 10 years during which time some of the city slickers and developers will have got in for their chop and will have ruined much of the Northern Territory or, if they have not ruined it, they will have obtained ironclad leases and the natural <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Territorians will have been denied.

* Those of us who have looked at the debates of the convention in 1 897 and thereabouts and who have sought to find what was in the minds of our constitutional fathers have quite a clear view- we must have, from reading the debates of those years- that there was never any thought that there would be introduced into this chamber senators from the Territories who would have full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> and who would upset the formula of an equality of numbers from each State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* A restriction on voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for territory senators is surely not seriously contemplated by the Opposition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for representatives of the territories in the other place have already been accepted by the Parliament and any suggestion of voting restrictions on territory senators would be inconsistent with this established concept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The founding fathers ensured that the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States were maintained and protected by providing in the Constitution equality of representation of the original States on the basis that the colonies prior to Federation were equal constitutionally and politically. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* But such Territory representatives in the Senate under this Bill are to have full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> and could as non-State representatives hold the balance of power in an institution set up to safeguard the interests of the States- a principle embodied in the Constitution without which Federation would not have been accomplished. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Although provision was made in the Constitution for representation of Territories in the Parliament, our founding fathers did not envisage that such representatives would have voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The national Parliament is of a bicameral character- that is, we have members forming a House of Representatives and we have members forming a Senate- and we are merely saying that the people who live in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are Australians who pay the same taxes and have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as everybody else even though they live in those Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* First the 2 representatives concerned had limited voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> but finally they took their places in the House of Representatives in the same way as other members from electorates in the Australian States and now they have the same voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The question which has arisen as a result of the measures now before the Parliament is whether the appointment of full-blooded Territory senators to the Senate, with all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of senators in terms of voting, requires that the people of the Territories should be brought into the compilation of 'the people of the Commonwealth' in section 24.

* The Government is trying to force a contract of this type upon the profession, when what members of the profession are asking for is a fair kind of contract which would give them some <span class="highlight">rights</span> when the skulduggery which they expect is brought to bear on them in the next few years.

* But today right throughout Australia in every private nursing home there are people- pensioners and the loved ones referred to by  Senator Melzer-  being kicked out of the homes and being robbed of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to receive medical attention because this Government has not the compassion to pay to maintain the private nursing homes.

* As a result of it, many areas have been extensively rehabilitated; a greater degree of social mix has been introduced to the inner suburbs; and inner suburban communities have been become better organised and more vocal in standing up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> against the many forces which threaten their homes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-50-0)

* It has a great impact on vast numbers of people engaged in the mining industry and on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and titles, which they hold, under which they work and under which their businesses can be carried on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* Any of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> or titles which countless individual members or our Australian community have acquired in order to mine for any mineral or to search for petroleum can be overridden by the actions of this authority in the way in which I have described. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* So it would seem that the so-called compensation provisions of this Bill may be quite illusory because the Petroleum and Minerals Authority could go in and take over a mining tenement before any mining had been done, and the owner would be prevented from exercising his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and acquiring ownership of the particular mineral.

* The Government ought to recognise that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which the Constitution confers are <span class="highlight">rights</span> which all parties, whether they are in government or in opposition, ought to protect because they are in due course the only protections in our constitutional democracy which we can rely upon.

* The question of whether the Commonwealth or the States has the responsibility within the Australian constitutional framework for the exercise of <span class="highlight">rights</span> arising or the performance of obligations accepted under the International Convention on the Continental Shelf and under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone is undecided.

* Whilst the Opposition holds firm to the view that it held in 1973 that there was no reason for the Government to declare the rules and obligations under which the mining code would be proclaimed in relation to exploration and exploitation of off-shore mineral resources, a sizeable number of senators- I take it that they are the 29 senators of the Labor Party- feel that they can ride roughshod over the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and over the pleas of the Labor Premier of South Australia who feels that the States should be consulted in these matters and that some residual right should be left with the States.

* It must be remembered that this Government was elected on 2 December 1972 and that on 15 December, within the first fortnight of operation of the Government, the Prime Minister issued a Press statement announcing the setting up of a judicial inquiry into the legal recognition of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the appointment of  Mr Justice  Woodward to conduct the inquiry.

 Mr Justice Woodward's commission is not concerned with whether <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land should be granted since the Government has already decided that they shall. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0)

* The text illustrates by various doctrines of finding in the Federal courts a constitutional issue, the doctrine of pre-emption which, as I understand it, means much the same as our occupying the same field for the purpose of a test under section 109 of the Constitution, by the references to constitutional causes and now the underwriting of criminal cases by human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and, I might say, the undermining of the enforcement of criminal cases by this doctrine, the utter weakness and danger of the system.

* In a practical sense, forgetting the States' <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue as an overriding one here- I suggest that the development of Australia's off-shore minerals is of greater importance than the issue of the States' <span class="highlight">rights</span> at this time after so many years of dissension about that matter have gone by- the subject really to be discussed tonight is whether the Commonwealth is to have the mechanics of making the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill operate if the High Court should find in its favour.

* It means that they retain their own basic identity- they retain thenown characteristics- and integration becomes a 2-way process which quite splendidly, if it is carried through into its ultimate, does not involve the disappearance of the minority institution and does not involve the disappearance of the minority traditions, because integration guarantees the same <span class="highlight">rights</span>, opportunities and responsibilities to all citizens whatever their group membership.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* It is for that reason that one of the proposed amendments of the Opposition is designed to divide that task, to let the Commissioner proceed with all speed and with all power to conciliation where possible and then, if that does not succeed, to allow for and to give proper legal aid to persons to enable them to proceed to enforce the <span class="highlight">rights</span> they then have.

* That has been my reservation about this legislation- not in any way in relation to the objective which is attempted to be achieved but to the mode of approach and whether you are not better to view all citizens in Australia as being entitled to certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> and certain protection by law, whether they are of a particular race, of a particular religion, or of a background or origin which may mark them as a minority group.

* I have always wondered whether our approach may not be better if we were not to emphasise racial discrimination as though it were the only form of discrimination that mattered but rather to concentrate on ensuring the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australian citizens in relation to racial discrimination or any other form of discrimination.

* The reason for that, as was given over many decades, was that such a system as is embraced within this Bill ran counter to the concept of the rule of law, and the argument went that the rule of law implied the absence of wide discretionary powers in the Government affecting the personal liberty, the private property <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the freedom of contract of individuals.

* But a change has taken place in recent decades, a change which I suggest has been dictated by political considerations and by a realisation by governments that it is essential to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals, especially in view of the increasing intrusion of the state into other affairs; that the extremely wide powers often of necessity put on a discretionary basis, and exercised by Ministers and officials, should be subject to proper checks and balances.

* Until the development of a system of reviewing decisions at the administrative level the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons flowed from 2 main sources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0)

* Firstly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that were conferred on them by statutes- specific <span class="highlight">rights</span> enforceable in the courts- and secondly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they were entitled to enjoy by virtue of the common law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0)

* So it is that we now have a third stream of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and they are those that I have already referred to in clause 26. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0)

* I therefore suggest that both sides of politics can be proud to see legislation before the Senate which crystallises- that is the point; it crystallises- the granting to the public at large of coherent <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to matters which impinge on their private and their business <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0)

* The Parliament will become accustomed to doing it, and I hope that within a comparatively short period this third stream of legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are now being injected into the armoury of the citizen will be regarded as something which is completely automatic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0)

* Therefore it is desirable that individuals should have some easy way of knowing that they have <span class="highlight">rights</span> and are not lost in the obscurity of these varying provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0)

* But to the extent that the prerogative writs, for all their defects and for all that might be said about their complexities, have always purported to assert or to recognise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the superior courts to control the proceedings of inferior bodies, it is wise that that right should be protected.

* It is an unusual provision because if there are <span class="highlight">rights</span> to obtain legal aid throughout Australia- at present there are exceptionally general provisions under which legal aid can be obtained- it seems unnecessary to insert a provision in a Bill specifically enabling the AttorneyGeneral to grant legal aid.

* Today many people in Australia are taking an interest in Aborigines and in land <span class="highlight">rights</span> but 12 years ago the actions we took then on behalf of the Aborigines of the Northern Territory were somewhat novel inasmuch as not very much similar legislation was being enacted by the Australian Government and by the States.

* The depasturing of sheep and cattle, later agriculture, mining, the fencing of boundaries and the construction of roads all represented such a serious interference with the former <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land which the Aboriginal had enjoyed that his livelihood was inevitably threatened; and quite often he was reduced to a beggarly subsistence depending upon the charity of the European which was derived from the very land from which he had been excluded.

* It is my belief that the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill is an historic Bill and that this is an historic occasion in the Parliament of Australia, because the passage by the Australian Parliament of that Bill is in its way as significant as the referendum result of 1967 in what it promises and means to the Aboriginal people of Australia.

* Answer- There is considerable evidence of 're-thinking' in all parties before the 1970s, despite the statement quoted above, but no party formally committed itself to recognition of traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span> until the Australian Labor Party, at its Conference in June 1971, pledged itself to grant land <span class="highlight">rights</span> when it should come to office.

* If  Senator Baume  is serious about his interest in establishing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people to secure the land which they properly own, perhaps he will be prepared to support the amendments which will be moved by the Opposition at a later stage to improve the probability that the Aboriginal people will indeed be able to exercise those <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0)

* When the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs reintroduced the Bill with 42 amendments there were improvements in 2 areas- the reduction in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Northern Territory to make ordinances interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals over their land, and some slight increase in the negotiating powers of Aboriginal persons with the mining companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0)

* Although the Bill provides that the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is to be consulted by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly when it is introducing ordinances on this matter, we do not consider that that provision for consultation is a guarantee that the views of the Federal Minister will be implemented or that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and desires of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory will have priority when the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is proceeding in these matters.

* As I have said, I do not speak from great personal knowledge or experience of the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, but I am convinced from the correspondence and the personal lobbying that has gone on during the last few months that the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory are not satisfied that this Bill represents a guarantee that they will be able to exercise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the land that they own.

* I hope that those supporters of the Government who have expressed such strong emotional support for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines will give action to those sentiments by supporting the amendments which we will be moving solely to improve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines under this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83)

* I think it is important that the Australian community sees that on both sides of this Parliament there is a commitment to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that the differences which exist between the Government and the Opposition are differences as to matters which are round the edges and matters of detail, but there are substantial areas of agreement and I do not believe that we serve the country well if we seek to disguise those substantial areas of agreement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83)

* Senator Robertson,  in a very careful and measured speech, a good deal of which I might disagree with but the presentation and content of which left nothing to be desired, set out at some length the particular things that have been done by the Labor Party over the years to advance the cause of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* On the one hand where an Aboriginal community makes a decision there is provision for disallowance very easily of the result- a bylawof Aborigines having a say in their own affairs, but on the other hand in the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) BDI, where there is a mining interest, although there is a right for a member of Parliament to move for disallowance of the proclamation, there is no provision that it is to be dealt with within 15 days.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1)

* In other words this now means that the Aboriginal people will be denied the basic aspects associated with their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> except for a few crumbs the Government will sweep off the table for them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-2)

* As time goes on it will not be  Mr Viner  who will be implementing the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation; it will be that party to which  Senator Kilgariff  belongs, the broken down Country Party of the Northern Territory, which has now changed its name to the LiberalCountry Party or something like that to give it some air of respectability, but it is still made up of all the political horse traders of the past who are out to protect the land for the white minority in the Northern Territory, not for the Aboriginal people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* I am very satisfied with the great bulk of the amendments which have been made to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill, which I think have improved it very considerably. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* In paragraph 274 of the second report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission  Mr Justice  Woodward states: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* I certainly hope that nothing in regard to the passage of this Bill, which deals substantially with traditional land and gives back traditional land which may well relieve a considerable proportion of the difficulties which people who are fringe dwellers and town dwellers may have, will lead to a lack of consideration for those <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but obviously this is not the Bill that deals with them and this amendment is therefore, I feel, quite inappropriate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* What we should be doing is facilitating the ability of Aboriginal people, whether they be town dwellers or reserve dwellers, to make land <span class="highlight">rights</span> claims. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* Certainly it is not land to which they have traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> but it is the land on which they have been living, some of them for their whole lifetime- particularly the younger members of the tribes that are living in this way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* To support these amendments would be to support the spirit of the Woodward report and would enable the fringe dwelling Aboriginal people to have the same legislative <span class="highlight">rights</span> as people living in traditional areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* It is obvious that these 2 gentlemen have been working against the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill for a very long time because in reply to a question asked by my colleague  Senator Robertson  on 6 December, recorded at page 2672 of  Hansard,  an astronomical figure was disclosed as having been spent on travelling by  Dr G.

* The Opposition said earlier that the Government has prostituted the terms of the original Labor Bill by comparison with the terms of this Bill in such a way that one becomes suspicious of a full stop at the end of every paragraph in case some hidden meaning is included to deprive Aboriginal people of their just <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3)

* Men who make profound statements in this Senate and expect to be accepted as people who are interested in the cause are now more clearly than ever before faced with the conflict of interest between an applicant for renewal of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to mine land and the traditional owners of the land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7)

* We would be writing into the statute a stipulation that the person appointed shall give paramount consideration to the interests of the Aborigines, whereas all that is being arbitrated upon is a claim to an interest by a person who has an existing estate as against the Aboriginal community which claims that it has Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7)

* Although the clause provides for renegotiation in sub-clause (2), that too is hamstrung by the reference to sub-clause ( 1 ), which provides that such leases should be ones where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of the parties are as near as practicable the same as those under existing Crown leases.

* However, the NACC accepts Prime Minister Whitlam 's most historic decision in December 1973, that his government would grant land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and as such, the NACC understands and supports the amendments that you as Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs have or will move.

* We also suggest that the Federal Government being unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Aboriginal people of Australia on the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and self-management bring indigenous experts from Papua New Guinea or American Indian Community to act as mediator between the Government and Aboriginal people of Australia on the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> compensation and self-management.

* To suggest that the Federal Government is attempting to take away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aborigines in those communities is quite contrary to the whole movement being made by the Federal Government to ensure that the right of self-determination of those two communities is assured.

* In the context of that agreement, the Queensland Government plans to gram to each local government authority a special lease of the area, to secure the preservation of the people 's traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span>, use and occupancy of the land.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It must be said that with the passage of time, during the last decade or so, the question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> has become a very important issue in the thinking and the consciousness of Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We hope that the Senate will regard the amendments as genuine attempts to realise the objectives of those people who support the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to realise the objectives which the Government set itself in the original legislation and to realise the objectives of the Party that I represent.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I am prepared to pay some tribute to the Government for the alacrity with which it has recognised the deficiency in the original legislation and to commend it for the progress that it has taken on this matter to see that land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are given to Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Of course, when one looks at the definitions in other Acts dealing with land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and Aborigines, whether it be the Queensland Act or our own Acts, one finds that in the minds of Aborigines, land represents premises. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* So when we talk about land <span class="highlight">rights</span> we are talking about a definition which goes much further than that which might superficially be the opinion of the general community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act is a unique and historical piece of legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Minister went on to say that a further aspect of the Government's policy in relation to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is to allow Aborigines 'as owners of their land, to follow their own lifestyles on their own land to me extent that they choose, to participate in and influence the course of development of and on their traditional land, and to take advantage of the full range of opportunities which development may open up to them '. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We are arguing about a Bill which seeks to change the existing 1976 legislation and to remove the provision for free and open decision making in respect of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and all that flows from that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* So land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are affected by this amending legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Whether it wants the land for a park, for mining, for a town or for some other public purpose, when that point is reached white priority takes over from the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to title as expressed in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> concept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I can foresee, certainly not in the lifetime of any member of this Parliament, a steady erosion of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, of titles, as society develops and as civilisation requires land for this or that purpose. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* That will act as an impediment to the whole principle of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The <span class="highlight">rights</span> which in the 1976 legislation rested with the Aborigines may now be given to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and I would feel much asssured if the Minister for once would have discussions with the land council first and with the mining interests last. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I imagine that there is an overwhelming acceptance in this Parliament of the principles that Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are sacrosanct, that we do owe them something in return for the persecution of the last couple of centuries and that we do owe them some loyalty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It seems to me that that is a harsh and tyrannical penalty to be imposed on a land council or those associated with the defence of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> movement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is intimidatory and acts in a way that will prevent the free flow of information which is essential if we are to realise the objective of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Firstly we are told that Aborigines are to be granted land <span class="highlight">rights</span> over certain areas, but then they must lease them to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* That is a restriction of the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the Aboriginal people, who must be affected by such empowering and overpowering restrictions, to understand and comprehend what is going to happen to their regions and to their land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I am sure that if honourable senators were to give their attention to this proposal they would see that it has nothing to do with Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In those two matters it would appear that the principles underlying the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act have been undermined, and I think the Opposition is entitled to ask why such provisions have been placed in the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In that regard, it is apparent that in certain aspects of the amending legislation the Government is saying that the promotion of the processing, mining and exporting of uranium should take precedence over justice, land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the very principles of self-determination for the Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We would argue that the sacrificing of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines which could come about as a result of this amending legislation puts their <span class="highlight">rights</span> at the altar of uranium mining and export. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is a difficult Bill to debate in a speech on the motion for the second reading, in a sense, because it is not a Bill which sets new directions for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In my view, this Bill quite clearly extends the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which were granted under the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation and it removes some of the problems which were not foreseen at the time that legislation was passed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* This legislation in fact represents an extension of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> beyond those granted in 1 976. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* On page 204 of that report it is pointed out by the Fox inquiry that it regarded the wishes of Aborigines for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the area as of prime importance in any consideration of the establishment of a national park. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* What I see as the real importance of this Bill is that it amounts to a confirmation of the principles which the Government espoused in 1976 when it promoted the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in this Parliament and saw that legislation passed through this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* They do not suggest that we should alter that legislation in the way in which we are altering it now but that it should be altered in a way which would substantially diminish the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines in those areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We are aware that moves by Aboriginal people to assert their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as provided by the Aboriginal Lands <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act have caused some people to become wary and even fearful of the new situation which now prevails.

* They have been pushed back whenever it met the commercial, social and economic convenience of the rest of the population The significant aspect of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill which was passed in 1976- now the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act- is that it represents a stop to that process which has gone on throughout European settlement in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I welcome the Minister's affirmation that people dealing with areas which are subject to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> now have to accept that Aborigines do have <span class="highlight">rights</span> in these matters and that they have to be accommodated accordingly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* When we passed the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> law we set out quite clearly, specifically and expressly in that law that the ownership of minerals remained with the Crown. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* What we did, however, was to give the Aboriginal people, the owners, extensive <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the surface which meant that persons seeking the minerals could take them subject to the greater right of the Aborigines to surface use and to surface enjoyment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I cannot speak for the rest of the colonies- I come from the colony of Western Australia- but I would like the Senate to know that, from the earliest colonial days in Western Australia, land which was alienated from the Crown carried mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I must say that in the case of most of that land the mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> have reverted to the Crown under legislation which was enacted in the 1960s or 1970s- whenever it was that the railway company reverted to the Crown. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Australian Mining Industry Council should bear that in mind when it puts out such pamphlets, distributes them to members of Parliament and makes statements suggesting that there is something peculiar about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are being granted to Aborigines in this case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The real point of what I have been trying to say in the last 10 minutes is simply that, under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act we have given considerable <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aboriginal owners of land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* For that reason I commend the matter to the Government for further attention in the hope that we might have a further debate on the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation next year, unfortunate as that might seem to some honourable senators.

* I commend the Bill and I await with interest the Committee stage where I think it will be demonstrated that the fear expressed by  Senator Gietzelt  that this Bill reduces the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines rather than enhancing and protecting them is in fact groundless.

* I remind  Senator Chaney  that the alterations suggested by the Opposition during the lengthy debate on the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bills in the other place would not, in most instances, have seriously upset the Government if it had accepted them.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* So this Liberal Party, which said three and a half years ago that it was a terrible thing for the Federal Government to attempt to proclaim <span class="highlight">rights</span> over minerals other than uranium, is now introducing an amending Bill to do precisely that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I think that is the same wording as a section of the Constitution but presumably, since it was repeated in this Act, the Government of the day wished to make it perfectly clear that this preempted virtually all States ' <span class="highlight">rights</span> over mining.

* If they had wanted to protest against the infringement of States' <span class="highlight">rights</span> or, more importantly in my view, the gross and scandalous infringements of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and the denial of the most fundamental principles of AngloAustralian jurisprudence, they should have started protesting 25 years ago about the Atomic Energy Act.

* This package of legislation deals, as I said, with amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, with aspects of the environment in the Alligator Rivers region where the mines are situated, and with Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* He said nothing during the whole of his speech to assure the people of Australia that there is an obligation on his Government to be able to present a clear cut case that the mining in and the proliferation of uranium from this country have been cleared by our scientists so that not only this generation, including the people who will be engaged in the physical act of mining and transporting uranium and eventually treating it, but also the generations to follow will have an assurance that their interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> are protected.

* When I say that this legislation offends against civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>- a matter in which  Senator Jessop  has now lost interest- I want to remind people like  Senator Jessop  of statements about this matter of civil liberties which were made in the Governor-General's Speech earlier this year.

* Whilst on the one hand mouthing pious sentiments about the need for consultation between State and Federal governments before codes are proclaimed or enforced, the Government has so worded the clauses of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act that, in fact, the States have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all.

* What the Government is trying to do by way of this legislation is reprehensible environmentally, as far as States' and individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> are concerned, and presents very real prospects of health hazards not only to those people working in the mining and processing operations but also to anyone likely to come in contact with accidental or deliberate radiation now or in the future.

* For this reason, the ABC's ability to secure the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to televise major national and international sporting events to an Australia-wide audience is at growing risk. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0)

* The effect of this progress is that the ABC is subject in, for instance, the case of the 1978 Wimbledon tennis championships, to criticism for not televising events in some States and many country areas not covered by the commercial television networks when they purchase exclusive Australian <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* I assume that the phrase: 'To preserve the ABC's ability to televise the major sporting events on an Australia-wide basis' means that because of the restricted budget that has been made available by this Government to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, it is unable to compete with commercial television stations in submitting tenders for exclusive Australian <span class="highlight">rights</span> to televise these national sporting events.

* These two reports are being tabled simultaneously because their central recommendation is the same, namely, that a joint parliamentary committee, to be called the 'joint committee on scrutiny of Bills', should be established to maintain a watching brief on all Bills introduced into the Parliament so as to highlight those provisions which have an impact on persons either by interfering with their <span class="highlight">rights</span> or by subjecting them to undue delegations of power.

* In assessing the need for such a committee we noted that many Bills come before the Parliament which contain provisions that: Significantly interfere with personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties; delegate powers which, arguably, should not be delegated at all; delegate powers to affect <span class="highlight">rights</span>, liberties and obligations without providing an opportunity for the exercise of those powers to be reviewed either by the Parliament itself or by an independent body; or delegate powers to impose obligations without any clearly defined guidance as to who is to impose them, upon whom and in which circumstances.

* What the Senate may need to be told, and what the Committee tries to set out in this report, is that a large number of legislative alternatives are available to the Commonwealth should it be minded to act more positively and effectively than it has in the past to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, interests, cultures and lifestyles not only of the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities but of all the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reserve communities in Queensland.

 Senator Missen in his remarks has identified in detail what some of those options are and there is no need for me to repeat them, except to say that they cover the whole canvas, from modes of control falling short of proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span>, through various kinds of familiar proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span>, including freehold and leasehold acquisitions, to various other forms of lesser proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> which can indeed be created by statute should the Commonwealth choose to so do.

* lt seemed fairly obvious to many members of the Labor Party back in the early sixties- I cannot recall the date- that when a low frequency radio station was being installed at North West Cape in Western Australia we were selling out our <span class="highlight">rights</span>, our heritage and our freedom to move in any global conflict.

* The basic problem with which each report sought to deal was the way- regrettably it has been an all too common feature of our proceedings- in which Bills that come into the Parliament contain provisions which impinge in various ways upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the subject or, on the other hand, have the characteristic of amounting to a potentially excessive and unreasonable or inappropriate delegation of Parliament's authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The function of the committee would be to scrutinise Bills and report to Parliament about whether the text thereof, expressly or otherwise, did one of three things: First, trespassed unduly on personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties; secondly, made <span class="highlight">rights</span>, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently-denned administrative powers, or non-reviewable administrative decisions; or, thirdly, inappropriately delegated legislative powers or insufficiently subjected its exercise to parliamentary scrutiny.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0)

* However, such breaches of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> slip through in legislation simply because we have not the benefit of outside counsel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0)

* It believed that the only way of ensuring that a Bill which has not yet come to this chamber will be considered from the point of view of the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, of the civil liberties in our society, was to have a joint committee and to have the Bill go before that committee at an early stage.

* I think that that even-handed approach is much more in tune with the reality of the problems that exist in that region than the pious sorts of statements which are expressed in the document which says nothing, which sticks to platitudes, and which ignores the historical development and the fears that exist in the minds of many of the countries of the world as a result of their development and progress towards establishing a society in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people shall be paramount.

* As far as the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation is concerned, I am surprised that  Senator Evans  has raised this matter again because I have said over and over again in answers to questions and statements that it was set aside to enable me to have discussions with the States, that those discussions had taken place over 12 months or more and that finally the States decided that they would not join in a national commission, as a result of which the Commonwealth will be proceeding with legislation confined to Commonwealth Acts and practices.

* Indeed, as I said in my second reading speech, in relation to the Opposition amendment extending the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal to assessments given to a State authority, the Director-General is proposing that in future in the rare cases where he may give a security assessment to a State about a State official, such an assessment should be given through a Commonwealth agency so as to preserve the right of appeal.

* Indeed, as I said in my second reading speech, in relation to the Opposition amendment extending the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal to assessments given to a State authority, the Director-General is proposing that in future in the rare cases where he may give a security assessment to a State about a State official, such an assessment should be given through a Commonwealth agency so as to preserve the right of appeal.

* The point which the Opposition is making is consistent with the point which we have made continuously throughout this debate that if information is to be communicated- we acknowledge the fact that there are occasions on which it will be necessary to do so- and if that information is likely to be or is capable of being used in such a way as to prejudice any individual, the individual who is so prejudiced must have <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60)

* But in a sense, if one casts these things in terms of functions and perception of functions, the Attorney-General, as principal law officer of the country, is seen, in the sorts of situations I have described, as the person who is most unlikely in the whole of Australia to give sympathetic consideration, and to be the person who should be concerned with the determination of an individual subject's <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60)

* Apart from being able to withhold from individuals the fact that they have an adverse security assessment, this provision puts in the hands of the Minister a fairly considerable power in relation to the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of individual citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60)

* I am therefore thrown back very largely on the sort of situation to which  Senator Button  referred- I think with some degree of disquiet- that is, that to a large extent the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, reputation, liberty and perhaps even the future career prospects of individual Australian citizens will be in large part determined by the personal attitude of whoever happens to be the Attorney-General.

* The other matter to which I wish to refer at this stage is that because of our commitment to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals being guaranteed, as against those of the State- which commitment has been expressed in a great many pieces of legislation which have come before the Senate- we feel that if we are to reflect our rhetoric in this place this legislation relating to Norfolk Island should be a model piece of legislation in terms of the imposition of a system of government on the people.

* We say that there should be a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the people of Norfolk Island and that, having regard to the historical context of Norfolk Island to which I referred earlier, the bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> should reflect and recognise the unique relationship to the island of Pitcairn Islanders, or Pitcairners, as a section of the Norfolk Island people.

* I suggest that perhaps it is no coincidence that the Minister responsible for the introduction of the Norfolk Island Bill in this Parliament, with all the authoritarian apparatus it contains, with all the insensitivity it demonstrates towards democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms, is none other than that same Minister, who is now in a different portfolio,  Mr R.

* Further, has the Minister or Officers of his Department discussed this matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs in view of the implications of the case for Australia's reputation in the field of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and particularly in view of our relations with member nations of the Association of South East Asian Nations?

* That is the purpose of this motion: The Opposition is seeking an assurance from this Government that, having been given the power and the obligation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines, it at least guarantees- if necessary by an Act of the Federal Parliament pre-empting the Western Australian Act, if and when that is passed- the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to vote at elections in Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0)

* I emphasise that it is part of the general view of the Government that not only Aboriginals but also other disadvantaged people in the community- disadvantaged in the sense that they are less able than others to take advantage of the electoral laws which exist to safeguard their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to vote- should be assisted in regard to this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0)

* I think I can say it is important to establish the commonality as well as the differences in these areas, and that the general thrust of this would be supported by the Opposition which has made it clear in bringing forward this motion- indeed even in  Senator Walsh's  speech- that it is concerned about the electoral <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0)

* First of all, even if that is the result of conferring appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the way in which the Opposition suggests that they ought to be conferred- it is by no means clear that in practice it will work that way- the Opposition still would persist with that point because we say that a procedure of that kind may just be the price which has to be paid for both the appearance and the reality of a just, fair and equitable appellate system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0)

* On the merits of that right of appeal it might be said, as indeed it has been said by the Government, that to give such a right of appeal to an individual at that level of the decision-making process is quite inappropriate; that what are involved are, after all- I think the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs,  Mr Viner,  used these words at some stage in the second reading debate or the debate at the Committee stage in the House of Representatives- policy considerations and not questions which really go to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or obligations of particular individuals.

* The unions and employees likely to be affected by this legislation take the point that, if their appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> are confined simply to the question of whether a particular employee is a riper candidate than some other employee for getting his marching orders once an excess in staff decision has been made, then that right of appeal is likely to be rather empty indeed.

* During the Committee stage of the debate in the House of Representatives the Minister referred to some of these; for instance, the date of effect of a declaration under section 9, the need to notify the employee who is declared of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and methods of appeal and the reasons for issue of a declaration which, of course, is the subject of this amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49)

* Instead of making those simple modifications to improve the Act so that it could operate in the interests of the public without intruding on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public employees, the Government has chosen to draft legislation which will spell the end of a critical, creative Public Service.

* Although we may have some misgivings perhaps about the Act or feel that the Act does not go sufficiently in the direction of redressing the vexed problem of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia, it appears from the Minister's statement that the Commissioner has acted with a degree of compassion, has applied some integrity to his obligations and has taken into consideration some of the moral factors which Aboriginal land claims have presented to him.

* Unfortunately from time to time some differences have been expressed between what we regard as our obligations with respect to land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory and the perhaps more short-sighted and subjective views that have been expressed by the Northern Territory Government which perhaps looks at development and its narrow perspectives somewhat in contradiction to the stated strategies which have been followed by the national Parliament on an all party basis.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0)

* That, of course, imposes on any Australian government a responsibility to ensure, to the extent that it can, that passports will not be issued to persons who may, in one way or another, threaten the security, national integrity or public order of another country, or the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of that country's citizens.

* It can readily be argued- I would agree- that it raises real questions as to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australians when another country says to an Australian citizen that he must have a certain item of information on his passport or a visa will not be issued to him to return to that country.

* We need to be assured that to the greatest extent possible the freedom to move abroad, which has been recognised internationally in the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and in our own tradition since the promulgation of Magna Carta in 1215, is fully recognised in our community.

* Incidentally, we are not told how long it will take for that signatory status to come about, but knowing Australia's track record in regard to the ratification of international treaties- a most unhappy one in any context in which State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests have been perceived to be involved, as no doubt they will be in this area- one wonders just how long this situation will continue to obtain.

* In the whole debate on human liberty over the centuries liberty, subject to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others, has been a profound qualification. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0)

* We have signified our recognition of that in the declaration of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0)

* The Opposition recognised that there were certain limitations on that because those limitations are necessary in the declaration of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0)

* This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure, as far as it can, that passports are not issued to persons likely to threaten the national security and public order of another country, or the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and welfare of its citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0)

* So we can see that, in determining the concept of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and human liberty, the right to travel is recognised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0)

* The freedom of the individual is recognised, but it is qualified, as it must always be, within our own society and within our own nation as subject to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others as we see them- the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the spouse, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the child, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the law in terms of breaches of the law- and subject to international <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations.

* What I said was that we subscribe fully to the notion of the freedom of the individual, but that we recognise that under the rule of law, which  Senator Tate  understands, that freedom is subject to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others.

* When I say that there is no appeals provision in the present legislation, I am saying that the environment in relation to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the subject, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizen, has changed considerably in the last few years as a result of legislation of the previous Government and of this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0)

* One other test, of course, of the sincerity of the Government's approach to the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to giving some viable status and character to the new Commission will be the way in which it approaches the staffing of the Commission and whether it mans it with personnel of capacity, credibility and energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The Opposition's general attitude to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill, the first of the duo before us, is, then, that it is a wholly inadequate solution to the problem of the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* What is needed, in the Opposition's viewpoint and I hope also from the viewpoint of a number of Government senators, is a piece of legislation which creates not just machinery for the discussion and promotion in a very abstract sense of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country but a means for people to enforce their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* What we want and what we need is a recognition in Australian law that the kinds of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are specified in the International Covenant are part of Australian law and can be relied upon when they are breached and threatened either in the private or public sector, as they so often have been in the past and in current circumstances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* What we need is a situation in which those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are enjoyed, not just in the Australian Capital Territory or as a matter of Commonwealth law, but where it really matters- in the States, around the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* We want a situation in which there is effective machinery for the enforcement of those <span class="highlight">rights</span>- but not just on paper. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* By an effective enforcement machinery- I will spell this out again in a little more detail later on- I do not mean simply the courts; I mean also certainly the kind of conciliatory machinery which has proven itself to be so appropriate for the resolution of a great number of particular kinds of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I mean an enforcement machinery which is an appropriate blend and balance of soft conciliatory measures and mechanisms on the one hand, but on the other, lying behind that, an iron fist- a court sanction, with the possibility of proceedings perhaps being initiated by the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> agency in question.

* The Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  is left by this Bill with little more than his title and a number of functions which he may or may not be allowed to exercise at the discretion of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission of which he is not to be a member. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The Victorian Government is prepared to spend more than three times the annual budget that the Grassby Community Relations Commission gets for a whole year to maintain its on-going program of investigations, conciliation, education, research and promotion of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> right around Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* In the first place, the object of the Bill is said to be the rationalistion of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> machinery- that is certainly not something which is objectionable to the Opposition in principle- and as a result the amalagation of the Community Relations Commission into the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Again that is something that might not in principle be objectionable, but the difficulty, the obvious anomaly, is that there is not provision in the legislation for the Community Relations Commissioner to be one of the commissioners of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission; nor, as I understand it, is there any intention whatsover on the part of the Government, without specifically mentioning it in the text of the legislation, to employ  Mr Grassby  as one of the new Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> commissioners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* In the performance of a function on behalf of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, the Commissioner is subject to the directions of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* It will be very interesting to see, for example, whether  Mr Grassby  will continue to be allowed to exercise his own judgment in relation to such matters as the issuing of court certificates in the Archer River affair, which honourable senators will recall involved the Queensland Government's refusal to transfer land <span class="highlight">rights</span> leases to an Aboriginal community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Thirdly, although it appears on the face of the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill that there is nothing in it to directly stop complaints of racial discrimination wherever arising, including Queensland, being channeled directly to  Mr Grassby,  as they have been in the past, the Opposition believes that one must take into account the potential effect of clause 1 1 (1) (b) of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill, which has an effect, and which would make it possible for the Commonwealth to delegate completely to a State any function relating to the promotion of the observance of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, 'including functions of the Commission'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The fifth point is this: The powers vested in the Commissioner for Community Relations by the 1 975 Act in relation to the appointment of local concilation committees and the central Community Relations Council-not that that has ever been established- are now stripped from him and vested in the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* In future his work is to be reported simply as one part of the larger annual report of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Let me conclude, at some length still, by indicating a little more constructively perhaps than I have hitherto what is the Australian Labor Party's attitude to an appropriate solution to these human <span class="highlight">rights</span> problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Let me start by saying, because it is necessarily a central theme in this package of legislation and in particular that part of it which concerns the Community Relations Commissioner, that we do not object to the better and more effective co-ordination of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> machinery in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* There is a case, in the interests of avoiding confusion in the public mind and in maximising the efficiency with which <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be protected in these areas, for all these various bodies to be integrated into a single organisational structure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* At the Federal level, to dismantle the Community Relations Commission, at the moment an effective and viable operation, and to incorporate it into this ragtag and bobtail new creation of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, would be a travesty of any such objective. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I do not mind personally whether ultimately those two committees are integrated into an effective organisation of a national sweeping human <span class="highlight">rights</span> law enforcement kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* But what one is concerned about, and I am delighted to get a denial, if that is what has just emerged from the Attorney's lips, is that there may be some residual lingering temptation, once this new machinery is established, to rationalise', to 'clear the boards', and to vest this particular function in the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* At the State and Territorial level, when one moves beyond the purely Federal scene, the Government acknowledges, and has acknowledged by its actions over the last two or three years, that there is a case for trying to weld together the various existing State and Federal human <span class="highlight">rights</span> agencies into some kind of coherent form of organisation, and the Bill, I suppose it must be acknowledged, does create the framework for further development on a co-operative federalist basis in that particular respect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* But experience so far surely should have persuaded the Government, and certainly persuaded  Mr Bailey,  as the Government's main adviser in this area, that cooperative federalism, here as elsewhere, is destined to be an abject failure, and that there is no prospect of getting effective, inegrated acrosstheboard machinery unless the Commonwealth itself takes the initiative and exercises that constitutional power which it almost certainly in my belief at least has available to it under the external affairs power, and enacts its own human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The centrepiece of the legislation, in the Opposition 's opinion, should be a national human <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* It is this kind of legislation one model- not the only one- for which presently exists in the ill-fated Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill of 1973 which we suggest ought to be the re-written form of this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* There were the old fashioned Parliament men, if I can so describe them, like Jim Killen, who were against what they perceived to be an encroachment by the judiciary on the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, prerogatives and preserves of the democratically elected representatives of the Parliament.

* I shudder at the thought of any repetition, but the risks of creating that kind of opposition have to be taken on and overcome by any government which is concerned to get a rational mechanism for the enforcement of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country.

* The kind of model that the Australian Labor Party is committed to in this respect is a national Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Putting it simply, a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> is a document which identifies fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedom and requires that they be respected and perhaps sets out some mechanism for their enforcement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* We acknowledge that it is appropriate and possible for such a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be introduced not only at the national level but also at the State level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* We make the point and will make the point throughout this debate that the real problem of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is at the State level and that we are only touching the tip of the iceberg if we operate at the Commonwealth level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* At the national level a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> could take the form of something that was incorporated in the Constitution itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* But pending the achievement of that millennium we would regard it as appropriate and desirable that a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> be incorporated into national legislation, along the lines of the 1973 Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* We believe it appropriate, if that legislation is to be worthy and deserving of the name, that it actually set out in specific detail the particular <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are being protected and give them some stature, some legal force.

* I do not think it is appropriate, although some people do, to talk about a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> as appropriately containing references to the right to clean air, a basic income, health care and so on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Rather, I think it is appropriate to talk, when one is giving civil liberties legislative form, in terms of traditional civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which do not depend on the mobilisation of large financial resources for their realisation, but simply depend on the attitudes, actions and good faith of governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* A lot can be said, but this is not the time or place to do so, about the kind of language in which it would be proper to couch such a national Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* It is possible- there are ample precedents in other countries for both ways of doing it- to use either very broad and general language or on the other hand very precise, meticulous language which is elaborately concerned to specify the exceptions and exemptions to the particular basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> in question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* My personal view would be to favour, at least so far as the statement of the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> themselves is concerned, relatively short, simple and elegant language, that being important not so much from the point of view of ease of judicial or other interpretations but because of the crucial imagination-capturing and educative role that such legislation would necessarily have to play. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I would not go quite as far as the United States in that respect nor perhaps even adopt the precise language used in the 1973 Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill in expressing <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* But I do think it is possible, within the kinds of parameters I have indicated, to produce statements of <span class="highlight">rights</span> in terms which are both succinct and sufficiently meaningful legally to be capable of application and practice, but which are not hopelessly offputting to the ordinary layman or average reader. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I do not accept for one moment the age old criticism about Bills of <span class="highlight">rights</span> that some danger is involved in specifying and listing particular <span class="highlight">rights</span> because by doing so we exclude the possibility of the continuing enjoyment of other <span class="highlight">rights</span> which may have been accidentally or inadvertently omitted from the list. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The simple technical solution is the insertion of a clause, called technically a 'non-derogation clause', in a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which simply says that the enjoyment of any of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> here set out does not in any way derogate from the existence of such other <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whatever they may be, which have hitherto been recognised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* So far as the enforcement of a national Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the kind that I am urging is concerned, it is important, I think, that there be some role by way of enforcement given to the courts, both to make declarations that particular laws or Executive acts are in breach of the Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>' guarantees and to apply standards in matters where they are otherwise lacking, for example, the criminal law enforcement area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The final point to be made about the concept of a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> is a very important one, namely, that it is not in any view- certainly it is not in our view- a universal panacea.

* It is not a substitute for other more specific, more piecemeal solutions to particular human <span class="highlight">rights</span> problems in the privacy area, the sexual and racial discrimination area, the criminal investigation area and other areas as well.

* If it were to be enacted in the way in which I have suggested and in the way in which it is encouraged to be enacted by the amendment which the Opposition has moved to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, we would be a hell of a lot further down the track in the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> than we are at the moment with the two Bills which are before us.

* On a first glance one would say that this Bill is part of that world wide enterprise that has had particular force since the Second World War when nations in reaction to the Nazi and the general Axis tyrannies decided that documents needed to be drafted which set forth as clearly as possible that human beings had certain human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which should be respected by whatever form of government had control of their country, be it a Communist socalled dictatorship of the proletariat or a Western democratic model.

* This morning  Senator Wheeldon,  in the presentation of a report, as a citizen of Australia was able to talk about the violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Russia because since the Second World War the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has been moved, however reluctantly, by the international movement of which I spoke, to go to Helsinki and to say to other nation states: 'Human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, though affecting individuals within our jurisdiction, are of sufficient international concern that we will bind ourselves to respect them'.

* An overall assessment of the legislation currently proceeding through Parliament must conclude that it is not strong enough to bring the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> situation in Australia into line with the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* In that report we, as a parliamentary committee, in a bipartisan, unanimous resolution, recommended that a parliamentary committee should be established to maintain a watching brief on all Bills introduced into the Parliament to highlight the provisions which had an impact on persons, either by interfering with their <span class="highlight">rights</span> or by subjecting them to the exercise of undue delegations of power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* We reasoned that, having been alerted by such a committee to a deficiency, danger or jeopardy in a proposed piece of legislation, the Parliament, with that recommendation of the committee before it, could make a judgment on whether to proceed with the Bill as drafted on the basis of countervailing considerations or whether to accept the recommendation of the committee that the Bill should be withdrawn in that it did, as the committee judged, put into jeopardy the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an individual. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* If the Government refuses in the course of a year to come into the Parliament and say: Yes, we agree that a parliamentary committee should have Bills before it in order to inform the Parliament, before it passes those Bills into law, that those Bills might place in jeopardy a human right', what confidence can we have that the Government will put before the proposed Commission Bills, or even enactments, which may have such a dangerous effect on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* I must say that I regret that this Bill in no way, despite its pretensions, falls into the general movement for the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which has swept the world since the Second World War. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* I suppose that the major deficiency is that there is a lack of remedy for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are outlined as the concern of the Australian community and which are to come within the jurisdiction of the proposed Commission.

* Chief Justice Holt, a great chief justice, born in 1642, Chief Justice at the age of 23 years, Chief Justice for 41 years- not some woolly-minded academic- a man who was harsh on treason and sedition but who held out against the prosecution of witches, who adopted a liberal construction on statutes compelling church attendance, a man who was concerned with human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and who used his unparallelled position as Chief Justice for 41 years to secure them, said of that elementary maxim: 'Whenever the common law gives a right it also gives a remedy'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* There is no doubt that this Bill is totally deficient according to the traditions of our rule of law when, in setting out <span class="highlight">rights</span>, it fails to provide adequate and effective remedies such as were contained in the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill put down in this place in 1973 by the then  Senator Murphy.

* When  Senator Puplick  was speaking, as he did for some time, on the history of the human spirit in trying to secure human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, he mentioned in particular the experience of the European community after the Second World War as something which appealed to him in its fruition in the European covenant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* Lord Hailsham, coming from a different common law tradition distinct from the civil law tradition of those whom  Senator Puplick  quoted earlier, stated, according to  Senator Puplick,  that there is a need for any statement concerning human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to include what is to happen when there is a conflict between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the community in general and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* This point is very important because  Senator Puplick  and  Senator Missen  too, I think were at pains to emphasise that we want to talk about <span class="highlight">rights</span> which inhere in the individual despite the will of the majority for the time being.

* Here a confusion, I must say, entered the remarks of both  Senator Missen  and  Senator Puplick  because, in saying that a judicially enforceable Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> is perhaps not the immediate answer to Australia's situation, I agree only in a sense of that expression, namely, that the judges should not be given as their basic raw material a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which is drafted so widely, so ambiguously, as to allow them the freedom of interpretation which was the concern of both  Senator Missen  and  Senator Puplick. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* That is quite different from the proposition I am putting that one needs a judicial Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> or list of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the sense that, once they are denned with as great a precision as is possible by the elected representatives, an independent and impartial tribunal, a judiciary, ought to be given the power to enforce them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* What this Government has failed to do is to go through the hard exercise of developing a list of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> appropriate to the Australian situation, detailed as unambiguously as possible, and then to say to the judiciary: 'We have done our part as elected representatives in identifying the <span class="highlight">rights</span> necessary for Australians in a democratic society; you develop the remedies and apply them, whether by way of injunction, direction, damages or whatever'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* Therefore, I would say that, given that understanding, perhaps both Senators Missen and Puplick could agree that a judicially enforceable Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>, tightly drafted and perhaps of greater length than the traditionally rhetorical Bills of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which grace so many modern constitutions, should be judicially enforceable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* If the Government is not relying on the external affairs power for the provision of this Bill- I will give the reasons why I do not think it needs to- why has it neglected to do this difficult task of compiling an indigenous list of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* There is no need for it, if it is not attempting to reach the States, to rely on an international covenant on human and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* If there had been some attempt to bring the States within the purview of the Commission, I could understand why there has been no attempt to take on the hard constitutional question whether we could have judicially enforceable <span class="highlight">rights</span> which could be won when at variance or inconsistent with State laws. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* But since that enterprise is not undertaken by this Bill, I cannot really see any excuse for the Government's not providing effective legal remedies for violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, even as measured by the international covenant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* As I said in my opening remarks, the Bill deliberately disables itself from dealing with that area of greatest and most constant violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> within Australia, namely, within the State jurisdictions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* Unfortunately the covenant, despite the fact that it arises out of the holocaust of the Second World War, bears all the marks of compromise and ambiguity which will occur when nations with different forms of government, different social systems, some totalitarian and some democratic, get together and try to formulate <span class="highlight">rights</span> which can be won by citizens against governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2)

* I remarked that, on the face of it, it appeared to be in harmony with the movement to secure human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which had swept the world, particularly after the Second World War in reaction to the excesses of the totalitarian regimes in Germany and Japan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* I noted that the movement had embraced countries as diverse as the democracies of Western Europe and the totalitarian dictatorships of the proletariat of Eastern Europe and that in all cases the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> had served as a criterion by which government action in this field could be judged. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* I think that on Thursday I indicated to the Senate why it was unfortunate that the Australian Government had not proceeded beyond that Covenant as the basis for the work of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission as outlined in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* The International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> being, as it is, the product of consultations between governments and bearing none of the marks of having been generated in a crucible of conflict between the oppressed and a government of totalitarian complexion or the marks which characterise the United States Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, for example, which did emerge from people who felt themselves to be oppressed, it is not surprising that the so-called <span class="highlight">rights</span> said to be secured are, in fact, constantly modified and eaten away by exceptions in favour of government regulation on grounds as vague as public health or morals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* Given the fact that the Government is not attempting to reach into the States' sphere, is not attempting to use any special constitutional power, such as the external affairs power, in order to reach into State jurisdictions, which is where most breaches of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia occur, it is unfortunate that the Government did not take the opportunity to set itself the very difficult task of defining for its own laws and territories those human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which ought to be secured without the sort of modifications and reservations which are expressed in the International Covenant which is taken now as the document of criteria of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* It is a fact, as has been pointed out by honourable senators, that most violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>- perhaps up to 95 per cent, according to documents circulated by  Senator Missen-  occur within State jurisdictions and have to do with freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that one has when a criminal investigation is carried out by the police, and that type of situation.

* Chief Justice Holt, who at the age of 23 years ascended to the bench and who was on the bench for 42 years, very strongly opposed the persecution of witches and very strongly tried to modify the effects of those laws which required compulsory attendance in certain churches and denied <span class="highlight">rights</span> to members of other, even Christian, communions.

* I might perhaps say for completeness of this part of the  Hansard  record that I believe that  Senator Puplick  and  Senator Missen,  in their remarks on the judicial enforceability of a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, were directing their remarks only to the need, with which I agree, to have a list of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which is sufficiently precise, comprehensive and free of ambiguity that it amounts to a direction by the elected representatives of the people to the courts that these are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be secured.

* It ought not to be left to the courts to have the freedom to interpret very widely and vaguely drawn expressions of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which might be compatible with some philosophical treatise expressing the yearnings of the human spirit that were dwelt on by  Senator Puplick  for the greater part of his speech.

* The Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Hayden,  has made it abundantly clear, as indeed does the Australian Labor Party's platform adopted recently at its 33rd national conference in Adelaide, that we would produce and introduce into the Australian Parliament a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which would be effective and would reach into the whole of each Australian jurisdiction in which <span class="highlight">rights</span> might be violated.

* In other words, it would regard, as I think  Senator Puplick  put most eloquently, <span class="highlight">rights</span> as being an inherent attribute of being fortunate to the resident within the Australian democracy and that State boundaries and State jurisdictions and the accident of birth and the accident of residence should play no part in the question of whether an Australian resident is entitled to vindication in an impartial court of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* To my mind, the fundamental defect of the Murphy approach was that a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> based on the United Nations Covenant would quite possibly be constitutional, under the external affairs power, but it would be in many ways less than our present <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* Senator Missen  has pointed out some substantial procedural defects in the present Bill: The lack of any enforcement power by the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission; the power given to the Minister to by-pass the Commission and give its power to the States; the possible conflict of the revised Freedom of Information Bill which I thought dealt very effectively with the undesirability of conclusive certificates by Ministers; and the undesirable introduction in the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill of the legal concept of standing to preclude people without sufficient interest from making a complaint.

* Instead, a Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission is to be set up to draw the attention of the Government and Parliament to areas where action seems necessary to make our civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span> effective- draw the attention, not take action.

* After all, as has been pointed out by Justice Kirby, despite the great differences of history, culture and language, European countries have been able to produce a European Convention on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and the Council of Europe has produced more than 100 conventions on such diverse subjects as extradition, the legal status of migrant workers, transplantation laws and suppression of terrorism.

* Before we pass this Bill which is openly intended to enable the Government to ratify the UN Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Covenant- if the amendments moved by  Senator Missen  and  Senator Evans  are accepted that would be made explicit- we must be sure that the Government is prepared if necessary to use its constitutional power within a reasonable time to ensure that the Bill is effective in all parts of the Federation without any limitations or exceptions.

* I do not say this in order to make a point against  Senator Puplick,  but at the conclusion of his hour-long speech the other night he issued a rather historic admonition to the Senate- that it is the role and the responsibility of this Parliament to debate and vote on violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> wherever they occur. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* The main reason we are unhappy and disappointed with the Bill is that it does not contain powers to enforce respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or to change any law found to be in contravention of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or to prosecute any person found to be violating human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* For example, if the subject of a complaint is a Commonwealth Act- for instance, the Act relating to the powers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its violation of someone's <span class="highlight">rights</span>- it would be equivalent to appealing against the AttorneyGeneral to the Attorney-General.

* Those principles were able to be set down in 1948 because through the development of democratic societies, parliamentary democracies and of countries with a live commitment to and experience of what we call the rule of law, there was in that experience and over those years certain principles which could be readily brought to mind and written down as the basic principles for the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals living in a society.

* I reject the motion that that is the reason why the Government is proceeding with legislation in this field, I believe that the common law has been very notable in this period about which I have been speaking in the development and promotion of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but I also believe that it has been necessary from time to time for those <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be given further, better and perhaps more particular expression through the parliamentary process.

* Most States, not only Queensland and Western Australia, although they have become the most notorious in this respect, have on their statute books legislation which, if enforced in a ham-handed way, is manifestly offensive to <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public assembly and freedom of association, assembly and political protest in the public domain. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* There is a political gerrymander which operates in Queensland offensive to any concept of equality of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which is probably the most spectacular in the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* But there is no doubt that at the moment the kind of intrusion on the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> which exists in Queensland is the most cynical, the most blatant, the most unself-conscious and the most complete in the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* It seems to me and to the Opposition that one cannot go on then to claim, as the Attorney did, that federalism was its own guarantee in a sense of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that somehow that principle of federalism on which he relied to justify the nonextension of the Bill into that area was itself a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> guarantee of a kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* The Opposition takes the view that the whole history of federations- I refer not only to Australia in this respect but in particular to the United States- is that they simply cannot be relied upon to protect through the participation of their member units the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* To add this definition and to bring the States into this will mean that one would have an obvious war, a fight between the federalist principle being espoused by the States and the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> principle. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* It seems to me that it is quite important that in passing a Bill like this we ought to place on record the approval which the Parliament gives to the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* Certainly it will help, just as every accession by another country does, to give extra weight and status to the Covenant and thereby help give some strength and credence to the international human <span class="highlight">rights</span> movement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* I suppose it will do something to burnish Australia's image internationally and help to justify our rather undeserved place on the United Nations Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, and perhaps enable us to earn one in due course under the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Committee which is established under this Covenant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* Of course, ratification does not necessarily mean that this will have any direct and immediate effect on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of ordinary Australians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* It is only if we accede in addition to the Covenant to the optional protocol that goes with it, which does not seem, regrettably, to have been seriously proposed hitherto by any government, Labor or Liberal, that there would be any really significant implications associated with attachment to international machinery, because accession to the optional protocol would mean that individual human <span class="highlight">rights</span> grievances could be the subject of complaint, investigation and report in the international forum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* I foreshadow something of a continued prodding over the next few months and years on the Government on the subject of the optional protocol because I genuinely believe- I hope the Opposition will be with me in this respect- that the optional protocol is perhaps the most significant part of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* The purpose of this Bill is to supersede certain provisions of the laws of Queensland that discriminate against Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and deny them basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* So the parties on this side of the chamber, who then constituted the Opposition, had absolutely no problem with the federalist principle when it came to specifically overriding discriminatory laws which sought to deny human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginals in Queensland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* I believe that the symbolic gesture of saying that we are establishing a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission and that its job is to monitor compliance with the international covenant should be followed by the third step of saying that we now ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and give a clear expression of our bona fides in this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* I believe the merit of  Senator Missen  's proposal, which is in similar terms to the proposal put forward by the Labor Party and endorsed by the Australian Democrats, is that it may, along with the similar clauses in the Racial Discrimination Act and the proposed similar clause in former  Senator Murphy's  Bill on Human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, build up a practice whereby this Parliament is involved in the process of telling the international community that we will be bound in some particular manner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* In conclusion, I simply wish to endorse the remarks of  Senator Puplick  and to express the same fear that I expressed in my second reading speech, that perhaps we have not yet had ratification at this date because the Government is unable or unwilling to go to the international community and say that it will endorse the Covenant as a whole, including Article 50, which requires of this Government that it ensures that these human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are effectively guaranteed throughout the length and breadth of Australia, in a sense without regard to its specific federal characteristics. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* In other words, from the point of view of other nation states, we go into the international community as an unitary state guaranteeing that wherever human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are violated in Australia they will effectively be remedied in accordance with the criteria set up by the Covenant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75)

* Of course, the principles of universal suffrage, the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> enacted in 1688 and freedom of religion are some of the great achievements of parliament and parliamentary democracy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0)

* I believe that we can still rely on these institutions, as we have in the past, to provide the legal framework and the legal sanctions which may be required to protect and enhance human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0)

* That is why the Government rejects the all-embracing solution which has been propounded in this debate, I suppose more particularly by  Senator Evans,  that we now need, because of the failure of or the retreat by the courts in this direction and because of the failure, as  Senator Evans  sees it, of parliament in these areas, some new approach altogether, namely a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> in line with the American model. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0)

* I am quite interested in  Senator Tate's  view that we should be looking at the development of some standards- call it a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> if you like- to which courts and parliaments can refer in deciding what decisions they will make. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0)

* Let us not forget the fact that a federal system of government- a system whereby the people are close to the individual government making decisions about them- is one of the important institutions by which human <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be preserved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0)

* That being the case, what we are seeking to do with the States is to involve them in discussions in relation to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> matters and to hope that by this means- I think there is reason to hope that this will happen in the course of time- the States will become more and more involved in an Australia-wide forum for the discussion and promotion of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* As I said, this proposal to amend the Racial Discrimination Act is designed simply to rationalise the machinery so that, when the proposed Commonwealth institution, which will have an overriding position in relation to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, is established, it will have that power in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act and in relation to other specific Acts in that area which might be passed by the Parliament.

* It is the real matter of importance that is involved here because despite the AttorneyGeneral's endeavours yesterday to say that the Commissioner for Community Relations will continue to exercise in practice the untrammelled powers that he has at present and that this is merely a formalisation of arrangements, the reality is that the legislation provides for the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  to become a mere cipher, a mere delegate, of the new Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission.

* Unless he is a member of this Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission I do not believe he can continue to do the job that he has been doing until now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I believe that it is important for honourable senators tonight to carry the amendment to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* If the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill and the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill are passed, that valuable body of experience, going back many years, will be embodied only in the person of the Commissioner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I say that with all respect to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Queenslanders, Western Australians, Tasmanians or anybody else to have their own authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* However, if somebody else were to be appointed to that position, I must say that I think that person, if he were a person of great integrity and great capacity, probably would want to think twice about taking a position which potentially was of such subservience as these Bills, the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill and the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill, would reduce it to. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The fact that racial prejudice against the Aboriginal community appears to be more of an issue in recent years is quite simply because Aboriginal people have attempted in recent years to assert and claim their proper and full <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* Every time they have done so those who have existed very well for a prolonged period by keeping those original Australians in their position of subservience have attempted to adhere to standards of the past, standards which I hope will become standards recognised as being of the past if human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation is to work effectively. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* If he is a member of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission I hope that he will get through that body more easy access to reporting to the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* If we are not vigilant about the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and all the claptrap that goes on from that sort of organisation we will be failing to meet a significant responsibility that we have not only to today's Australian community but also to communities of the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I direct the attention of honourable senators to those criticisms- the criticism that the Commissioner is placed under the control of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, that complaints will not be as easily handled by the Commissioner in the future, that he will be subject to directions that his access to staff will be reduced, that his report to Parliament will disappear and that his role in promoting an understanding and a public awareness of racial discrimination matters will also disappear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* As we are to have a situation in which race relations in Australia will be severely strained not only, as I have said, by the increasing education of the Aboriginal population but also by the increasing number of Vietnamese refugees and the increasing tensions in the employment situation in this country, the Commissioner for Community Relations ought to be one of the members of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, one among many and an equal among many. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* Of course, the person holding the office of Commissioner for Community Relations has to be a person with great compassion, a person with energy, a person with the capacity to apply initiative, a person devoted to the principles of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and a vigilant person. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The amendment proposed by  Senator Missen,  that the person holding the office of Commissioner for Community Relations shall be one of the members of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, is a matter which was raised during the very lengthy second reading debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The proposal is that the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission which, as stated in clause 7, is to consist of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and not less than five or more than nine other members, should be amended to have the provision that one of those persons appointed to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission shall be the person holding the office of Commissioner for Community Relations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The Government's view is that the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission should not have ex officio members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* So the Government's view is that when it comes to a point, the proposal is that this Commission will be the watchdog over all the various manifold aspects of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> questions which are dealt with in the Covenant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I think it is fair to say that if the Government was considering these questions afresh and was entirely able to develop its own blueprint for a Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission and a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> approach, it would be doubtful whether it would actually create a statutory position of a commissioner of human relations as has been created by the Labor Government under the Racial Discrimination Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The Government believes that if we had a Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission that should be the body which exercises the functions under various pieces of legislation that may be assigned to it in the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The mere fact we are faced with a particular set of circumstances is not sufficient, in the Government's view, to mean that it is required by legislation actually to have determined for it and dictated to it who should be members of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission which it is proposing to set up. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* That is not a reason, in the Government's view, why that person should be made a member of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I think that the indications from the Racial Discrimination Bill are that we will assign the Act functions to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* Of course, in any event the matter would in the end be in the hands of the Parliament as indeed the future of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission is in the hands of the Parliament at the moment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* The first relates to sub-clause ( 1 ) (c), which provides that one of the functions of the Commission is to report to the Minister as to the laws that should be made by the Parliament, or action that should be taken by the Commonwealth, on matters relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* In other words, I am seeking to make it quite clear that the Commission is quite independent and free to carry out is own inquiries and investigations under its functions and to report to the Minister, but that the Minister may request it to carry out a particular inquiry on a matter about which he may wish to have the benefit of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission's views. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* Sub-clause ( 1 ) (c) is in fairly general terms, but the way in which the AttorneyGeneral is now amending it to make it quite clear that it is to be on the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission's initiative or when requested by the Minister, widens it and puts it beyond doubt. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* Clause 9 seems to me to cover all kinds of things standing by itself, but when one looks at subclause (d), which relates only to action which is needed to be taken to comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or other instruments and it is only on the request of the Minister, one could well interpret that this cuts down or restricts at least that aspect of the matter and therefore that, read with sub-clause ( 1 ) (c), it really cuts down sub-clause ( 1 ) (c).

* I have not asked  Mr Rowland  to report on all matters but rather to report on specific practical difficulties which have been drawn to my attention or allegations about practical difficulties with respect to the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation which have been drawn to my attention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-19-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-19-0)

* By way of example, mining companies have represented that it is not possible to explore for minerals on Aboriginal land because the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act does not permit an agreement to be made before a mining lease has been issued. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-19-0)

* This in itself, I submit, requires a measure of social control which can only erode civil liberties and hard-won industrial <span class="highlight">rights</span> and which obviously threatens the environment if governments do not see their responsibility to adopt a policy and a process which protect not only the present environment but also the environment in the thousands of years that lie ahead.

* The purpose of the amendment is to ask the  Senator to  express the opinion that this legislation, which deals with Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory should also encompass land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginals in the Australian Capital Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* We are somewhat at a loss to understand why there has been this long delay on land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, in the absence of information and in the absence of any endeavours by the Government and its Minister to explain to the Senate why it has taken six months for this matter to be proceeded with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I am not able, in the absence of any inside information, to know whether my deductions are borne out, whether my own views or the views of my party are correct, that, in fact, there are some difficulties for the Government as it relates to the States' inability to appreciate what the national Parliament is doing about the problems of Aboriginal affairs where they relate particularly to the relatively new issue of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I think it would be fair to comment that they arise as a result of representations that most probably have been brought to the attention of the Government as a result of either deputations or disagreements that might exist in respect of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, its operation and the reluctance of the present majority in the Northern Territory Government to accept the views of the national Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* From the Labor Party's point of view we believe that we are probably witnessing something of a counter-attack by those forces in the Australian community who believe, when it comes to the question of development and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of development on Aboriginal lands, that there has to be a recognition of the latter day claimants as against the original claimants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* In Queensland we have witnessed numerous blatant exercises by self-interested groups and land grabs by aluminium companies which are ably assisted by a very oppressive and racist government which, when it comes to the question of whose <span class="highlight">rights</span> have to be recognised, seems invariably to go against the Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* For a Minister of the Crown to find it degrading to mix with Aborigines who are, after all, his voters and constituents seems to me to be related to the problems we were discussing yesterday on the racial discrimination and human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation.

* If that is the case- that is the way the Opposition reads the legislation- it seems to be in line with the Government's aim to prevent any possible impediment to the views that have been expressed openly in a publication by the Australian Mining Industry Council and in other magazines, which seems to indicate that they have set about to weaken the legislation and to vest more power in a development-minded Government to deprive Aborigines of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that were originally contemplated in the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Naturally, the Opposition is concerned that the mentality or philosophy that seems to be characteristic of mining companies is seen in a proper perspective, having regard to our fundamental commitment and obligation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* One would think, therefore, that rather than leave the matter in the hands of the Minister for the Capital Territory, it ought to come within the province of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs so that he can take on board the proposition that at some future stage the Government should introduce legislation which would extend at least the Northern Territory Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, with all its weaknesses that I have referred to, to Aborigines in the Australian Capital Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Before land <span class="highlight">rights</span> became the issue that they are now- and we have what we might call very forward legislation which is emotive and the subject of much discussion- Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation was introduced in the Northern Territory by that much criticised legislature the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which in those days was the Legislative Council.

* If we want to have a reasonable and logical debate, a debate that is related as far as is practical to the factual situation in respect of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, it seems reasonable that the information ought to be furnished to the Parliament rather than to the Minister, because whilst some of us certainly would take a broad view with respect to the current Minister, I would not apply the same yardstick to his predecessor, who I felt did not have the breadth of vision or approach to the matter to satisfy the Opposition.

* I acknowledge, as I did in my reply to the second reading debate, that this amendment arises out of a suggestion made by  Senator Cavanagh  who, in correspondence, drew my attention to the difference between the disallowance provision of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act as it relates to a national interest proclamation permitting mining over an Aboriginal veto and what might be called the standard provision in the Acts Interpretation Act and in a number of other Acts.

* The only other point I want to make- I stress that I stated it in correspondence to the Minister- is that the disallowance provision is important in the operation of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act because of what  Mr Justice  Woodward said in his report.

* Apart from making that point, I suppose that all we can say is that perhaps regulations ought to be established which clearly define who would be able to make an application and that that sort of information ought to be freely available to the persons who might find that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the matter are being neglected because of the inability to provide themselves with financial and legal assistance.

* As a result of pressure from the Government, the Council of the Australian National University adopted new fee rules in 1977 which provided for exemption for compulsory membership of, and payment of fees to, approved student bodies and gave <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal to any student dissatisfied with decisions on those issues.

* As I understand it, the Attorney-General's amendment, which he foreshadowed when this matter was last considered, was to delete that sub-clause entirely as being now unnecessary and redundant, given the extension and the extended operation of clause 9 ( 1 ) (c) which refers not to the Covenant but to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> generally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* True it is that human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are denned in this Bill as meaning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms recognised in the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or in any relevant international instrument and true it would be that a general power under clause 9 ( 1 ) (c) to investigate matters relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> would accordingly enable a good deal of the matters associated with the operation of the Covenant to be specifically dealt with; but our concern, for example, is with something like Article 4 1 of the Covenant which on its face is not concerned with the subject matter of any of these human <span class="highlight">rights</span> but with the procedure whereby a state- that is, a country which is party to the Covenant- may declare its recognition of the competence of the international human <span class="highlight">rights</span> committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* It may well be that if clause 9 ( 1 ) (d) is retained this can be a vehicle whereby the Commission can properly investigate the extent to which human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being effectively looked after in the State areas of the Commonwealth to which this Article of the Covenant applies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* But in the absence of clause 9 ( 1 ) (d) it might be that a reference to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> would have to be read down to mean simply human <span class="highlight">rights</span> applying in the Commonwealth area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* Because of the absence of a specific reference to the Covenant and having simply the reference to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which happen to be defined in the Covenant, it seems to me that the procedural clauses in the Covenant and those parts of the Covenant which are not directly concerned with human <span class="highlight">rights</span> as such but rather with the scope, operation and procedures associated with the Covenant, may be outside the Commission's scope. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* I know that the Attorney-General is preoccupied with people peering over his shoulder and talking into his ear, but my argument was concerned with particular issues, such as the meaning and application of Article 41 and Article 50 of the Covenant and the possible application of the optional protocol, all of which seem to be outside the immediate sphere of dealing with human <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* Perhaps I may add that, in the present state of international alignments, it would be hazardous for the Commonwealth to enter into new international obligations such as the Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, and yet not assume legislatively the necessary powers to secure respect for those obligations throughout Australia.

* It would add another string to the bow of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission to at least be able to investigate and report upon the state of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, by reference to the standards in the Covenant, in the States and in the territories where most of the civil liberty interfering action, as we know, takes place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* The real thing that matters, if one is talking about the enjoyment and the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the States, is to have some enforcement mechanism attached to provisions of this kind which would enable the investigation of particular complaints and the following up of such investigation by, where appropriate, court proceedings and by, where it is even more appropriate, the striking down in those court proceedings of particular pieces of obnoxious legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* It does go so far as to not only permit the Commission to examine any State law or enactment in a general way but also to look at a particular instance where it is said that the State Act or some activity authorised by State law does violate a human right as judged by the criteria set out by the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* It goes a fair distance towards enabling this Federal Commission to look at that vast area where human <span class="highlight">rights</span> violations may occur within Australia, namely within State jurisdiction and under State law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* It also deserves support because it continues to amend the Bill in a way which is only in harmony with the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, which the Bill is said to be attempting to bring into some operation within Australian law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* As has been pointed out time and time again, if Australia is to go into the international community and say that as a nation state it will try to ensure that all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> outlined in the Covenant are recognised throughout Australia, it has an obligation under Article 50 of the Covenant to ensure that as far as possible recognition of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> goes beyond any barriers arising from our federal system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* I said, I hope fairly clearly, during my speech at the second reading stage, that I believed that failure to extend the power of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission to examine matters under State law was an unnecessary weakening of the effective role that the Commission could play in the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* I would be heartened in my belief in this position if I could have an assurance from the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Durack)  that if the Senate passes this Bill, which is openly designed as a mechanism by which we can ratify the United Nations Covenant, the Government is determined to make the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation effective in Australia by any means in its constitutional power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* This amendment seeks to extend the function of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission to an examination of State laws, Acts and practices to see whether they conform with the principles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>.

* I thought I had made it perfectly clear- I hope 1 did in my second reading speech when introducing this proposal and in my reply to the debate during the second reading stage of the Bill- that the Government is not prepared to agree to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission having a function in relation to State laws and practices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* To be quite frank, it is difficult to conceive of somebody going to the trouble of mounting a case before the Commission, going through all the difficulty, the expense and certainly the consuming of time to bring before the Commission's notice an alleged violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, if it were not of sufficient concern to the complainant.

* We believe it is appropriate that the Commission may on occasion engage jointly with the States in the exercise of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> protection but we do not think that it is ever likely to be appropriate that the Commission divest itself entirely of this function. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47)

* In order to facilitate a lot of the administrative arrangements that will be required in the performance of functions by the Commission and to rationalise as much as possible the whole area of administration of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> matters at Federal and State levels, hopefully with the prospect that there will be firm cooperative arrangements in all these matters, it is desirable to provide in the legislation that arrangements may be made between Commonwealth and State Ministers in relation to the performance of functions and in order to provide for State or Territory authorities to act on behalf of the Commonwealth in some respects.

* As far as  Senator Evans's  amendment is concerned, obviously it is part of the Government's policy that where in some places it may be desirable to utilise a State body or authority to perform work for the Commonwealth, that is all part of the good sense of rationalisation of the administration of matters in the area of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>.

* I can report to him that, as  Mr Staley  has stated on a number of occasions over the last few weeks when the matter has been raised by  Senator Maunsell  and by honourable senators opposite, some of whom were indicating their interest a few moments ago, the Government is particularly concerned that not all Australians will be able to see the various matches programmed and is actively continuing its efforts to ensure that these relatively recent developments in the granting of exclusive television <span class="highlight">rights</span> to various television stations do not unduly prejudice the long history of widespread coverage of sporting events.
