* The project provides for the linking by a continental pipeline of the city of Sydney with the Gidgealpa <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas fields in the Cooper Basin in South Australia, with an early extension through Wagga to Albury and Wodonga with later extensions to Melbourne and the Bass Strait reserves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0)

* The first stage of the project will be from Sydney to Gidgealpa ensuring that there will be no delay in planned supplies of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for Sydney under the long standing city of Sydney gas franchise legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0)

* The total concept will provide a completely interconnected grid system, ensuring back-up supplies in case of interruption by <span class="highlight">natural</span> calamities or exhaustion of supply from an individual source.

* It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an authority with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of our greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> resouces available to the Australian people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0)

* We can regard ourselves as a very strong nation economically, but according to world standing we are not at this stage of our development a nation capable of doing all of those things within our own capacity if we want to make adequate use of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and ensure to our populace a betterment in its standard of living, as is so enthusiastically and imaginatively described as the aspiration of this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0)

* He spoke of Liberal Party senators in these terms: 'This rabble, this mish mash of vested interests, this motley crew of incompetents still believe themselves to be our <span class="highlight">natural</span> heaven born rulers'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0)

* It is Incredible but true that this rabble, this mish mash of vested interests, factions, bitter old men and frustrated new ones, this motley crew of incompetents still believe themselves to be our <span class="highlight">natural</span> heaven born rulers.

* The <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of seabed areas and their exploitation or potential exploitation have become increasingly important in recent years, and with advancing technology that trend, no doubt, will continue at an accelerated pace. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* Similarly clause  11  makes it clear that the sovereign rights of Australia in respect of the exploration and exploitation of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* The value of production of minerals recovered from the seabed so far is small when compared with that of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* Particular attention will be directed towards ensuring the conservation and preservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and of the marine and associated environments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* To that end clause 88 empowers the Minister to cancel any permit or licence if he considers this to be in the interests of the safety of navigation or the conservation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources or otherwise in the public interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* Our main aim will continue to be that this legislation shall encourage efficient and adequate exploration and exploitation of our offshore resources and at the same time control operations in such a way as to ensure the conservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and the preservation of our marine environment to the common good. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* But now that there has been a change of Government and the present Government wants to take the <span class="highlight">natural</span> course of asserting its rights by legislation over these off-shore areas, the Opposition moves that the Bill be deferred until consultation takes place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0)

* The Bill seeks to repeal provisions which give to the Attorney-General the power to deport persons who are not <span class="highlight">natural</span> born Australians - notwithstanding the fact that they may be naturalised Australians - and who have committed certain offences under the Crimes Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* The Bill seeks to assert the principle that all Australians, irrespective of whether they are <span class="highlight">natural</span> born or naturalised, have an equality under the law and should be treated equally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* 1 emphasise that what these conditions do is to distinguish between Australians who are <span class="highlight">natural</span> born and Australians who are naturalised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* We believe that naturalisation gives to an Australian citizen absolutely and without equivocation the same rights under the law as <span class="highlight">natural</span> born Australians possess under that very same law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* It is anolomous and offensive to suggest that some Australian citizens who are not <span class="highlight">natural</span> born may be deported at the discretion of the Attorney-General and we welcome therefore the opportunity when it is presented to us to indicate our complete support of the Government in the repeal of these provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* But once we confer the citizenship of this country upon a person who has come to this country as an immigrant and who has resided in this country we owe to that person 2 things: We owe him the obligation, firstly, that we will treat him as an equal of persons who are <span class="highlight">natural</span>-born Australians and subject him to no penalties, prohibitions or disabilities which are different from those to which the <span class="highlight">natural</span>-born citizens are subjected; and, secondly, that we will not deport him to a country where he may be dealt with not on the basis of his conduct but simply on the basis of his political opinions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* We have seen a host of non-<span class="highlight">natural</span>-born Australians subjected to police raids and police searches over the past weeks, the like of which this country has never experienced in the whole of its history. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* Attitudes have changed and the Government and the Opposition are as one in maintaining that there is an absolute equality of treatment which must be accorded to all Australian citizens irrespective of whether they be <span class="highlight">natural</span> born or naturalised and that Australian's who are not <span class="highlight">natural</span> born Australians should not be deported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0)

* We acknowledge the recognition, by the present Government of the steps which the preceding Government has taken and in which we take some pride and we naturally would support the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* All honourable senators ought to take pride in the fact that generally there has been a bipartisan approach in regard to this type of aircraft offence, and it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that the Opposition would wish this Bill  a  speedy passage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0)

* But with the development of technology, with the demand for new materials and the discovery of vast <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources on the sea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

* Therefore we can expect to find that there will be a continuing necessity for Australia to be adverting from time to time to its boundary relations and its sovereignty over areas adjacent to the vast Australian coastline, as other nations wish to exploit the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of a marine character. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0)

*  In the other place the responsible Minister, the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  when introducing this Bill stated that it seeks to establish a Pipeline Authority for the transmission of petroleum, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and other hydrocarbons, by interstate ring main pipeline systems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* In its essential factor, it is carrying petroleum, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and other hydrocarbons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* There are a few examples in Australia of pipelines carrying articles other than petroleum, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and water. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* Nonetheless, the expansion of this system could go beyond the carriage of petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* There is concern at this monopoly power over the sale of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* There is the power given to the Authority to subscribe for or otherwise acquire shares in a public company, which seems to us to give it power to take over such companies and, in effect, effectively to nationalise the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry and to make it a total captive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* It rather looks to us as if there will be a considerable delay in the scheme in providing <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and energy to [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* There can be no doubt that there is a growing necessity for a national policy in relation to the conveyance of these great <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of Australia which are being found now in greater abundance both on-shore and off-shore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The recent discoveries of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in various parts of Australia indicate the prospect of larger discoveries of such an important source of energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas or oil fields. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* I think it is of importance to stress that the location of these <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and oil fields, which have .been, found and, which we have every reason to believe will, be found in greater abundance, presents ;this nation with a remarkable opportunity for .decentralisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* It is all very well to say ;that .these <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources should be ? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* As a Western Australian, naturally I think firstly of the prospects that the discoveries, of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas off the north-west shelf of Australia present for the development of the Pilbara region of Western Australia, a region 'already famous for the richness of its mineral deposits, particularly iron ore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The Government's object in creating this Pipeline Authority is ostensibly to provide a cheap, convenient and efficient means of conveying the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of petroleum from one part of Australia to another. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* What would be the point of a link of that kind when already there are perfectly adequate sources of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for the eastern seaboard in areas such as Moonie, Gidgealpa and Bass Strait? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* It would be wrong, at this stage certainly, to be draining the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas sources off the north-west shelf for consumption in Sydney when those resources present a golden opportunity for regional development in the area in which they exist, such as in the region of Pilbara. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* I well imagine that there could be, or should be, serious objections from some members of the public to a pipeline being built in their area, or through a particular place of <span class="highlight">natural</span> beauty, or where some local interest would be destroyed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* We recommend that a national pipelines policy be implemented immediately and that the legislation be enacted - this may require the co-operation of the States - to regulate the construction and operation of pipelines for the carrying interstate or intra-State of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* I point out that Sydney has needed <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for many years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an authority' with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of our greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources available to the Australian people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* By that I mean that the farms could be farming <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of all descriptions such as gas, oil, minerals or any other resources with which our country seems to be so richly endowed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* We will also see that our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources - our iron ore deposits, our steel making processes and the long line that goes from the raw metal to the completed pipeline - will be, as far as possible, utilised by Australians for Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* Planned supplies of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will be made available to Sydney. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The total concept will provide a completely interconnected grid system, ensuring back-up supplies in case of interruption by, <span class="highlight">natural</span> calamities or exhaustion of supply from an individual source. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The simple purpose of this measure is to set up an authority with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of our greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources available to the Australian people.

* The Arabian States of the world were not in a similar position, but this <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource had to be exported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* When one speaks about the preservation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources one could even recall the turn of the century and the schism that split the Republican Party in the United States when there was a changeover from  President  Theodore Roosevelt to Howard Taft. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* Even in those days - and I say this with deference to  Senator Webster  - it was not a case of socialists being in the wings and deciding what should be done with <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* I have a particular reason for saying that because at the present time in the United States the Government is extracting from the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry and the oil industry a pretty sizable rake-off which is going into the celebrated Land Water Act which set up a repository of feed-back money to the States, be it for such a mundane subject as better sewerage treatment works, for conservation or the acquisition of vast tracts of forest land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* I sincerely believe that whether it be a State enterprise or a private business enterprise a levy must be imposed to protect not so much <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources as the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment so that people can at least experience the good aspects of the Australian continent and sec that they are protected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* He has indicated quite clearly to me in letters that the policy of the United States Senate towards more and more demands for conservation is that instead of the taxpayer having to pay for them, it will dig more deeply into the pockets of the big exploiters of resources, d have no doubt that under this Bill we will be able to keep a very effective hand on the tiller so far as the income from our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources is concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* I think that this legislation represents another milestone to Australia which is well and truly protecting its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* On the face of it, it appears to be setting up regulatory authority to establish throughout Australia an interstate ring main pipeline for the carriage and distribution of petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas products. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* In the domestic area there is the real possibility that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will reduce domestic fuel bills by anything from 20 per cent to 35 per cent and in the industrial area by 30 per cent to double that percentage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* So <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas presents a very important new resource to the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* That definition shows that the Authority does not deal just with pipelines; it is not just an Authority which deals with oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* It is the <span class="highlight">natural</span> institution to do this and money would have been saved if it had constructed the pipeline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The Opposition would not in any way oppose the idea of a pipeline authority in a regulatory sense which is set up to see that throughout Australia there is a network of pipelines carrying in an equitable fashion petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* Honourable senators opposite have the audacity to say that the best way to establish the pipeline is to leave it to the same speculators who are not concerned with the building of the pipeline or with the conservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> energy resources but are concerned merely with making a kill upon the stock exchange by promoting and by selling shares in a company which will build such a pipeline, to the disadvantage - it has been proven to be the disadvantage - of many thousands of young and small investors and of many investors who will place more than a small amount in such companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The Authority is set up for the transmission of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* It has been shown by previous speakers, by surveys and by exploration that there are vast areas and vast resources of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The Committee turns next to a statement by  Mr W.  W. Pettingell,now  Sir William  Pettingell who, I understand, is  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Gas Development Association. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* At the present time, we have a situation in which cities such as Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane already are connected to <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas with pipelines supplying them from the various gas fields. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* I say that because the Bill allows the Authority to buy and sell hydrocarbons - liquids and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* Firstly, I presume that the Authority will set the price for transmission and also will set the price that it is prepared to pay for the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas at the well-head. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* Secondly, the Authority could charge excessive prices for the transmission of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, particularly to competitors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* As a consequence of this freeze and the high cost of getting funds into Australia for exploration, a complete killing of the incentive for further exploration of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources could occur. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0)

* The French officials have in their Part 'B' sought to demonstrate that French atmospheric nuclear weapon tests in the Pacific are without hazard by invoking dose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (the ICRP), by arguing that the radiation doses from those tests are small compared with those from other man-made sources of ionizing radiation and by comparing those doses with those inevitably received by populations from <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation.

* On the assumption that the risk of radiation injury is directly proportional to accumulated dose, it follows that exposure from <span class="highlight">natural</span> background carries a probability of causing some somatic or hereditary injury, which would be present even without the addition of man-made exposure.
