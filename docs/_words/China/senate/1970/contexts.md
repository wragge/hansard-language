* One of the greatest mistakes Australian producers could possibly make at this time is to think that because of a realignment of international feeling towards Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> there will naturally be a burst of buying of Australian primary products, whether it be wheat or anything else.

* I sound that warning because I feel that it is much better for Australia to seek the broader markets of the world and to sell smaller quantities to a greater number of countries, than to become committed to supplying huge quantities to a particularly shaky market which could possibly exist in any primary production trading with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>.

* The important factor which I want to mention is that whereas before we were exporting one-third of our exports to <span class="highlight">China</span>, this year without any <span class="highlight">China</span> sales we have had the greatest sales of wheat on record, sales which have amounted to some 394 million bushels.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0)

* It has been freely said in our community, particularly in farming circles, that we will be able to sell large quantities of wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> provided we take action which some people call 'recognition' and for which others use the nicer phrase of 'normalising relations'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0)

* 1 can remember statements appearing in the Press in the middle of 1960s to the effect that in the United States there were certain pressures to get rid of its wheat surplus by throwing wheat on the market and making it available to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, if necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0)

* In those circumstances I hope that the Australian farmer, whatever he thinks about Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, will not fall for the joke that we only have to perform the 3 ceremonial kow-tows in Peking and <span class="highlight">China</span> will write out a cheque for millions of dollars for our wheat.

* In fact,I am reminded as I hear the interjection, that the Australian Labor Party is seeking to make a great feature out of the fact that it would go so far as to sacrifice friends in the Pacific - Taiwan and others - to obtain recognition from the People's Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>.

* I point out to him that the other day in relation to a similar question on the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> I said that the Chinese were very shrewd businessmen and that they would buy in the world market when they were ready to buy and when prices, freight rates and all other things were right.

* However, some Opposition senators take the simplistic view that because there is a capacity for Australia to say that we require peace and stability in South East Asia, and because that view happens to coincide with the views of <span class="highlight">China</span> but apparently does not coincide with the views of Vietnam, we are somehow showing bias towards <span class="highlight">China</span>.

* That statement, which was made in October 1975, reflected considerable foresight about what might happen, and indeed has happened, in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0)

* The Minister has made a very important reference in his statement to the restraint that has been exercised by the Soviet Union in the current crisis in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0)

* For example, it is not hard to see that the Soviet Union might feel that Europe, Japan, the United States of America, and <span class="highlight">China</span> are in fact in many ways aligned against it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0)

* I believe that we have to be careful about that sort of development if we expect the Soviet Union to continue to exercise the sort of restraint it has exercised so far in the conflict in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0)

* I only add that in the context of the tendency towards alignment between Europe, Japan, the United States of America and <span class="highlight">China</span>, Australia obviously falls into that group along with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations and the countries of the South Pacific.

* I take it that  Senator Wriedt  is raising the question of <span class="highlight">China</span>'s punitive action against Vietnam because of <span class="highlight">China</span>'s claim that certain action has taken place on its southern border; and as well, Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0)

* The Government has made it clear that in fact <span class="highlight">China</span> should withdraw its forces from the northern provinces of Vietnam and that Vietnam should withdraw its troops from Kampuchea.

* Another criticism that I wish to make of the statement and, indeed, of many of the speeches of Government members is that I have detected a pro-<span class="highlight">China</span> bias and an anti-Soviet bias. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0)

* The honourable senator might dispute that there has been a pro- <span class="highlight">China</span> bias or an anti-Russia bias, but he cannot dispute that I have detected it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0)

* I suppose one could argue that if we see <span class="highlight">China</span> as a potential massive trading partner of the future, which it is- if the supporters of one's party see <span class="highlight">China</span> in that light- there might be a philosophy of let us not be nasty to <span class="highlight">China</span> because it might affect our trade negotiations.

* History has shown that the invasion of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the north, the north-west and the west is difficult because of the problems presented by Mongolia and the Himalayas and with respect to logistical support.

* One reads in Chinese literature and hears from Chinese diplomats- and this is in line with the Maoist theory- that even in the event of a nuclear war <span class="highlight">China</span> would kill 200 million of the 230 million Russians and Russia would kill 200 million Chinese but <span class="highlight">China</span> would still have 800 million people left.

* I remind the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that if in an attempt to ingratiate themselves with <span class="highlight">China</span> they offend or play to the paranoia or the fear that is in the Russian mind they will do a great disservice to this country.

* I have yet to hear a member of the conservative parties in this country acknowledge the grievous mistake that they made, that in fact they are the ones who can be termed to be the guilty ones in respect of the conflict that is taking place in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula today.

* We refused to understand <span class="highlight">China</span>, but all of a sudden, in pursuance of this anti-Sovietism, to which  Senator Chipp  referred, we seem to be adopting a pro-<span class="highlight">China</span>, anti-Soviet position as if that were the only issue that ought to be considered in respect of the problem concerned.

* In recent months the Iraqi Government has been spending a lot of its time beheading its pro-Soviet leaders but despite that, despite <span class="highlight">China</span>, despite Rumania, despite Yugoslavia, we now suppose that Iran, Ethiopia, Angola and Afghanistan are permanent creatures of Soviet policy.

* There was an opportunity to create an Asian Yugoslavia, an independent country, following its own social path of development, but making its decisions of selfdetermination and not being pan of the <span class="highlight">China</span> bloc, which the Liberal-National Country Parties said was the cause of the war in Vietnam.

* But to me the lesson was this: As far as the Western powers- we could call them that or a loose alliance of the ANZUS powers- are concerned, if we look at it strictly on percentage lines, we are no better off than we would have been if we had not worried about the futile war in Vietnam because by now the ideological rivalries between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union concerning the land mass of Asia, in particular South Vietnam, would have been apparent.
