* He went so far as to say that that neutrality should bc protected and preserved and guaranteed  -  I think that was the word he used - by the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, lt is not very surprising that the Opposition should over the last few days have seized upon this statement as evidence that there is some sort of collapse in this Government's defence policy, that there is some sort of basic change in the defence and foreign policies of Malaysia, and that the whole situation politically in South East Asia has changed dramatically and basically. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* Of course, what he is saying here, when one looks and thinks of the specific terms in which he puts it, is not merely that there should be some utterance by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> that it will guarantee, in some loose way, this neutrality that the Prime Minister looks for. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* What he wants, and what we want is what we have always maintained, namely, that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should cease its aggression against the smaller nations of South East Asia and should cease arming, helping and financing Communists in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> who are seeking to upset the governments that are presently in power in those countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* Indeed, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should cease its actions which are destined solely to prevent the people of those countries in South East Asia from determining their own type of government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should cease the aggression that it has been engaged in over recent years towards countries in South East Asia and, in particular, that it should cease trying to achieve that object by financing, arming and giving support to Communist movements in South East Asian countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* We should have some assurances from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> that she would abide by the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* But when one has looked at what the Malaysian Prime Minister wants to see in action from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, one can go from there to see what Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has done in the past, because by its actions in the past, I suggest, one can get some indication of what its actions are likely to be in the immediate future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* Its present policy should be enough to indicate that there is little, if any, likelihood that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> would wish to or would take any steps at all towards guaranteeing the neutrality of Malaysia, any other country in South East Asia, or the region itself, because one can see what Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is doing at present.

* It has given positive and articulated promises to Communist movements in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> that they can have safe rear areas in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>; that it will give political support to those Communist movements; that it will give material support to those Communist movements and that it will give military support to those Communist movements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* I should have thought that the classic example illustrating that there can be no assurance at all that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> would be interested in guaranteeing the neutrality of South East Asia is the closed door policy that it took towards the Djakarta conference on Cambodia, because here was a clear case of an opportunity to have a degree of neutrality brought about in 1 South East Asian country - Cambodia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* Firstly, Malaysia will look for some indication of integrity and some indication that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> would refrain from subversion and aggression in South East Asia; secondly, Malaysia still recognises the dangers of the Communist menace to neutrality in the region, and thirdly, Malaysia will continue to - contribute to peace and stability in the region of South East Asia, lt is our policy that if one has to negotiate on matters such as the neutrality of South East Asia, one should negotiate from a position of strength and not weakness. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* Of course, one wants to see co-operation not only with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> but with any country which is prepared to leave other countries, such as those in South East Asia, alone and with any country that is prepared to refrain from' aggression and from assisting subversive elements in those countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* I have very grave doubts whether Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is interested in the slightest in maintaining or guaranteeing neutrality in South East Asia so 1 venture to suggest that members of the Opposition are perhaps somewhat misguided, with all respect to them, in thinking that in this statement from the new Prime Minister of Malaysia is an indication of a change in his foreign or defence policy and that, consequently, there will be changes in our foreign or defence policy.

* I found it interesting to hear the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown)  putting forward his arguments, particularly as 1 agree with him in part when he said that he believes that we should be looking for <span class="highlight">China</span> to recognise and protect the neutrality of South East Asian countries.

* Despite all that the delegates heard at this conference they still return to this chamber muttering all sorts of hackneyed cliches such as 'non-interference', 'the Russians are just as bad', and 'if it is wrong to trade with Rhodesia it is wrong to trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* I suggest that honourable members opposite read bis statement of 22nd January 1968 in which he suggested that it would be necessary for Malaysia to establish a policy of non-alignment and that the area should be neutralised, that neutrality being guaranteed by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* If the Australian Government cannot recognise this basic fact, that Malaysia's policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span> is changing, then it does not know the world in which we live and it simply cannot plan defence policies for this country, because they will be based upon a fallacy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* But at least the doors must be opened and the goal of US policy must be in the long term, ending the isolation of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, and a normalisation of our relations with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> because, looking down the road, and let's just look ahead IS to 20 years, the United States could have a perfectly effective agreement with the Soviet Union for limitation of arms - the danger of any confrontation there - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1)

* On 11th May the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  announced that the Government had as its long term objective the normalising of our bilateral relations with the People's Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, to which end it had been decided to explore the possibility of establishing a dialogue with that Government.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0)

* But in the one item that the members of the Opposition pick on to make a political exercise - wheat - <span class="highlight">China</span> sees its opportunity and of course takes the opportunity the Australian Labor Party has offered it and puts the political screws on in that way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0)

* It was about the time of the Senate elections last year that the Canadian Government finalised its arrangements for the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> anr) 2 weeks after that was announced to the world the Chinese announced that the Canadians had won a bumper contract, one of the best that the Canadian Government had ever pulled off.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* Despite the substantial shift in the position of the United States and other countries, including Australia, Peking still resolutely insists that it alone should have the seat and that Taiwan, which it considers a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>, should be expelled from the United Nations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* There has been a considerable amount of talk in the United States and in Australia about finding a compromise solution which will enable both the People's Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Taiwan Government to be members of the General Assembly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* However, the basic difficulty is that both of these governments claim to be the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and are accordingly constituted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* In the case of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> it seems very unlikely that the Government would be prepared to accept the terms of a resolution which also provided for the seating of the Government of Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* As things stand, both Peking and Taipei claim to be the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and it is very difficult to see how both would be accepted as members of the United Nations on their own terms or how they themselves could accept this arrangement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* In short, the position is that, although <span class="highlight">China</span>'s chances of getting into the United Nations are better than ever this year, whether it actually becomes a member or accepts membership depends essentially upon what sort of compromise formula can be worked out in the course of the Assembly debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* I shall conclude on this point: It was rather remarkable at the United Nations that those who were to the forefront, supporting the entry of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, were considered to be among those who were the most vitriolic and who had completely ignored the appeal that had been made by U Thant and the  President  of the General Assembly that the 25th Anniversary meeting was to be a General Assembly of peace. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* This was utterly ignored by countries such as Albania and others who with vitriolic outbursts and with complete disregard for anyone's sense of loyalties or traditional loyalties claimed that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted to the United Nations and that Taipei should be thrown on the scrap heap.

* Well, the only reason why people of such intellectual incapacity bellieve that the Chinese will come down for the next election is this: They look at a map hanging on a wall and, because <span class="highlight">China</span> is above Australia on that map, they think that the Chinese must come down to Australia.

* The greatest hope for a lasting accommodation between the conflicting interests so manifest in the South East Asian and East Asian area may lie along the path of endeavouring to convince the People's Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that Japan has no territorial designs on Chinese territory and that neither the United States of America nor Japan wishes Japan to move into a vacuum left by an American withdrawal.

* In this connection, I do not see why the move towards normalisation, to use a horrible in-word, of our relations with the People's Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should be accompanied - as some members of the Labor Party seem to want - by a move to exclude discourse with South Africa.

* I am of the view that he is not suited to hold the first appointment as  Chairman  of the AustraliaChina Foundation, for five reasons, not the least important of which is that he has come desperately close in his own views not only to saying that Australians should understand the Chinese view of the world but also that Australia should support the Chinese view of the world.

* Thus, in the South East Asian situation, where currently there exist conflicts between Kampuchea and Vietnam and between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>, we are told simplistically, if impressively, that the conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing among four States- the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0)

* In the Minister's terms, it was clearly in the United States' geo-political interests, after the conclusion of that notorious and infamous war in Vietnam and Cambodia, to provide massive resources to rebuild Vietnam on the basis that that would be the only way to lessen the dependence of that country on either the Soviet Union or <span class="highlight">China</span>.

* On the other hand when I visited <span class="highlight">China</span> as the guest of the People's Republic, a visit for which I am grateful, it was quite clear that the Chinese, for their part, could not countenance the existence of a bloc of Soviet organised states on their southern borders.

* I think part of the difficulty that we face in this situation is the fact that the Australian people's own regional isolation and European heritage have left us singularly ill-equipped as a community to understand the complex mix of historical, cultural, territorial and international factors that have led to the war currently raging between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam, and Vietnam and Kampuchea.
