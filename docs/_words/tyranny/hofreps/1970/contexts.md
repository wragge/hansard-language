* Unfortunately, by lending their support and their names to these "Trojan" organisations within our ranks, they are bei'ng used as respectable fronts for sinister objectives, the ultimate overthrow of our democratic form of government, and ils replacement by a form of  governments  known for its absolute <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and totalitarianism'.

* This is a <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority - a complete denial of the rights of the minority within a democratic society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19)

* Sixthly, we say that the Moratorium is wrong because it mentions the so-called corruption and <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in South Vietnam but there is no mention of what is happening in North Vietnam. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25)

* If this is our standard of comparison we should be comparing also the disadvantages of what has been called, in a book of some consequence, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance, lt is here; it is with us; it will not go away and it is absolutely basic to the high costs of providing comparable services, and even better services in some cases, in Australia than in other developed nations.

* This is a free, non-party vote to be taken by members of the Parliament who not only want to sec the Parliament work efficiently but also want the Parliament to be a permanent safeguard for the people of Australia against <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, despotism and the kind of abuse of power which governments sometimes take upon themselves.

* I believe that ultimately, if they keep on with these pressures, they will debauch the economy of Australia, they will impose then their own <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> on the workers of Australia and the end result will be that the workers will be losers, not management as we know it today.
