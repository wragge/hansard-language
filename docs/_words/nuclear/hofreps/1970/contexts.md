[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-14)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-14)

* The initial analysis was prepared by the Commission on the basis of a continuing study of the developing costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power throughout the world and the translation of this data to Australian conditions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-14)

* The costs of electric power, conventional or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> depend upon many factors such as the type of station, its location, its capital cost, whether it will meet base load or peak demands, whether it is a single or multi unit station; upon its fuel costs, interest rates, penalties to be met for the avoidance of pollution and other factors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-14)

* The impact of these factors is different for conventional and for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> stations and therefore a simple comparison of the Jervis Bay Station with a conventional station is not possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-14)

* The Commission's general conclusion was that a first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> station, which would have great value in establishing this new technology in Australia and the opportunities for training and experience which this would provide, would deliver power at an acceptable cost. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-14)

* However any cost disadvantage could be more than offset by other benefits, depending on the relative movement of certain costs, a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> stationshould show an economic advantage over a conventional station.

* Given that no major changes occur in the trends of costs of both conventional and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> stations the short answer is that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> stations will be economical when the electricity systems in the respective States are large enough to absorb larger units; this is likely to be the case in some States in the mid-1980's but will vary from State to State.

* The Opposition moved an amendment in the debate on the Estimates in order to give the Government an opportunity to examine thoroughly the economics of the introduction of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in Australia, particularly as it had been estimated by  Sir Philip  Baxter, the  Chairman  of the Atomic Energy Commission, that by the year 2000 something like $5,000m would have been spent on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0)

* If a decision had been taken to proceed with the construction of the Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station earlier this year and the estimated expenditure had been included in this year's Budget, I have been reliably informed that the amount required by the Atomic Energy Commission would have been in the vicinity of $6m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0)

* This growth means that quite large units will he required in New  South  Wales and Victoria in the 1980s, lt is in the large unit sizes that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is likely to first become competitive with fossil-fuelled power stations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0)

* If the leaks from the Cabinet are as numerous as the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury)  has suggested they are then it would appear that there have been leaks about the deferment of the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Jervis Bay because the estimated price of the successful tender - the one that was recommended to the Cabinet - has been given and the name of the tenderer has been given. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0)

* So, in that 12 months of deferment, let us appoint a select committee, let it begin operating and let us get all the information possible so that before the taxpayers of Australia are committed to an expenditure of $5,000m by the year 2,000 not only the Government but also all members of this Parliament will know the true story of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation in Australia.

* The statement by the Minister for National Development  (Mr Swartz)  today, which is but one of his numerous statements made during approximately the last month, confirms the feeling, never more starkly portrayed than on this issue, widely held throughout the community that this Government's policy is to thrust Australia into the field of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power without any reference to Parliament, and without recourse to parliamentary inquiry, parliamentary debate, public inquiry or public debate.

* I think it is important to note that the present situation throughout the world is that there is sufficient <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel available to meet existing requirements for a few years, but that by about 1976 or 1977 the position should vary and from then on the demand for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel will increase rapidly until the early 1980s when it will escalate considerably.

* Therefore the position is that the whole of the industry must be geared to meet a rapid increase in demand for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels in the early 1980s, persisting through into the next century, because whilst we may have some faith in the research and experimentation associated with the fast breeder type of reactor, that of course will not become a viable proposition for some years and will not have its main impact until early in the new century.

* At this point in time  -  61 years later - we pick up again the general ideas if not the specific recommendations of Admiral Henderson in the era of Lord Kitchener and that, I think, is generally welcomed in Western Australia, although there are very distinct reservations in the minds of some people who believe that the naval base should be Exmouth Gulf or at some other point on the coast, and in the minds of some who hold the view that navies should have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> propulsion - I am not speaking about weapons - which would render them independent of these inflexible and vulnerable bases.

* Remembering that Academy of Science report, let us consider these figures: The total injection of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission products so far into the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere comes to approximately 511 megatons.

* So under any measurement, there is a very real case for Australia being consistent in its opposition to atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing and, if we are going to the extreme of taking the French to the World Court, we should certainly place a much stronger protest with the Chinese than the one which was firstly described as an oral protest to which, therefore, we would receive no reply and which secondly was seen to be a written protest and to which still we do not know whether we are to receive any reply.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0)

* Accordingly I do not doubt for one minute that this Parliament could make laws and the Australian Government could make administrative arrangements safeguarding the Australian population from the effects of mishaps in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered warships or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered merchant ships.

* The Sydney and the Perth hospitals, for instance, have made no additional arrangements and have no preparations under way to deal with the unlikely but the catastrophic effects of any mishap to a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered warship in Australia's two largest naval ports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0)

* If these <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered vessels take part in such wars and an ordinary old fashioned bomb or an ordinary old fashioned torpedo hits them, blows them apart and sinks them, does what happen come within the category mentioned in the subheading to paragraph 6 which is 'Collision"?

* Do we not then have a situation where we are releasing unknown quantities of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, maybe not immediately but sending it to the bottom in these beautiful reactors that are beautifully safe and marvellously efficient in producing energy when in the right place, in a ship floating on the surface of the water?

* Of course recommendations do not have to be accepted but it is preferable that they be made, particularly by people who, at large public expense- something like $2m in this instance- have been immersed in the complexities of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> question and have had the advantage of taking evidence under oath.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* I believe, and the Opposition believes, that at this moment, given what the Fox Commission reveals about the hazards associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and given some of the firm statements which were made in the report urging caution and delay, Australia should not, at this stage, commit itself to promote the expansion of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Policy respecting Australian uranium exports, for the time being at least, should be based on a full recognition of the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, and should therefore seek to limit or restrict expansion of that production. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* Let it be made perfectly clear that the Opposition does not support the establishment of new uranium mining capacity in Australia until the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry has put its house in order. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In electricity generation terms we are abundantly rich in energy resources, particularly brown and black coal; so rich that it is difficult to envisage in the medium term the need to develop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power as a source of electricity generation in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2)

* In conclusion, I urge the Government to take heed of the Fox Commission's call for a full public debate before a decision is taken in respect of the establishment of new uranium mines and not to commit Australia to a role in the expansion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power which its citizens and their children may regret.

* The conclusion to be drawn from the world energy outlook is that even with a greatly increased <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> program, with reduced energy growth and with the greatest possible expansion in oil and gas production, the Western world will still face an energy deficit after 1990. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0)

* A proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities without adequate protection against diversion of material to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons production or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosives would pose serious threats to international stability and peace, obviously inimical to Australia's interests and to global and regional security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* It was for this reason that, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last September, the Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  described the strengthening of measures to prevent proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons as a central and fundamental area in which Australia looks and hopes for early progress. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* I make clear from the outset that the term 'safeguards' is used here to denote the whole range of measures used to provide assurance that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied for peaceful purposes is not misused for non-peaceful or explosive purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* It would not be desirable for safeguards requirements to be left to  ad hoc  decision as this would not afford the strong and clear support for international efforts to strengthen controls against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation to which the Government attaches major importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Australia is a potentially significant supplier of uranium, but if we are to play the part which this potential gives us the opportunity to play of contributing effectively to international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, it is desirable that uranium importing countries and other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries alike know where Australia stands on the matter of safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In the narrow sense, safeguards are systems of containment, surveillance, accounting and inspection of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials and facilities designed to verify that diversion does not take place from peaceful to non-peaceful or explosive purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In a broader sense, safeguards for future Australian uranium exports would comprise, as well as the application of international safeguards in this strict sense, the securing from importing countries of adequate assurances regarding the use and control of supplied <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material and the conclusion of binding arrangements to give effect to such assurances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In the case of non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states- that is to say, all countries other than the 5 existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons powers recognised by the Non-Proliferation Treaty- sales will be made only to countries which are parties to the NonProliferation Treaty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Because of these countries' safeguards obligations under the NonProliferation Treaty this policy will make sure that the entire civil <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in such customer countries is subject to effective safeguards to verify that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, whether of Australian or any other origin, is not diverted from peaceful uses. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The Government is aware that work has recently been under way within the International Atomic Energy Agency on a new system of equally stringent safeguards to cover the entire <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states which are not parties to the NonProliferation Treaty.

* We will therefore export only to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the uranium we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from uranium importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Fifth, the Government takes the view that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use should remain under safeguards for the full life of the material in question or until it is legitimately removed from safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In line with this basic principle the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states should make provision for so-called fallback safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Further, the bilateral agreements should provide for Australia to make alternative arrangements for the safeguarding of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by us in the event of international safeguards as such ceasing to operate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Moreover, the Government feels it is reasonable to ask importing countries who will already accept International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards of comprehensive scope under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to accept that, at the first fallback level also, international safeguards should apply to all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material not just that portion supplied by Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Sixth, the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for uranium supplied by Australia to one country, or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use, to be able to be reexported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* This provision will give Australia the means of making sure that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the uranium we supply or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* This provision is in line with the practice adopted by other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The figure of 20 per cent has been chosen as representing a level of enrichment below the practical requirements for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive, while being above the enrichment level required for most peaceful uses, excepting, for example, some research and radioisotope production reactors, for which approval to enrich to the necessary level would need to be obtained. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* Eighth, the Government is aware of the interest of some countries in the reprocessing of spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel to meet their anticipated fur.ture fuel requirements, and to facilitate the management of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material following its use in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* At the present time the need for reprocessing and the details of an effective control regime for this area of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle are the subject of close study internationally.

* The Government's view is that, prior to a clearer outcome emerging from this current international activity, it would be premature for Australia to adopt a unilateral position on the detailed conditions under which we might be prepared to agree to reprocessing, if any, of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* In order to reserve effectively Australia's position on this matter for the time being we would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian uranium that any reprocessing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0)

* The incorporation of these provisions in the Government's safeguards policy reflects our concern that total <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> control should encompass safeguards not just to verify that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material is not illicitly diverted from peaceful uses by national governments or national authorities, but also to protect <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material from illegal use by groups or individuals.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* Let me outline two factors which were obviously very influential in the decisions which Japan has made over a number of years to develop a significant capacity to generate electricity from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generators. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* Therefore one of the attractions of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy to Japan is that she can stockpile or store quantities of uranium very readily. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* That is clearly one advantage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy to Japan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* Therefore it is Japan's resolve to develop a significant proportion of her electricity power generating capacity from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* Japan believes that if she has some part of that capacity supplied from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sources, some from furnaces fuelled by fossil fuels and some from hydro-electric power, and then tries to diversify the sources of supply of uranium and of the fossil fuels as far as possible she will have provided the greatest possible guarantee against disruption to the sources of supply of any one of those fuels from any one part of the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* So clearly the generation of power from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sources is an important part of Japan's policy to remain self-reliant and to insulate herself from troubles in the rest of the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* A second reason for Japan favouring a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation program is an environmental one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* In the context of that problem it sees <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation as offering a great advantage because furnaces which are fuelled by fossil fuels- by oil and by coal- have the disadvantage of adding enormously to the air pollution problem, an enormous problem in a small country geographically, such as Japan is, with such a huge population. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* Therefore the Japanese see the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy as contributing to the solution of her air pollution problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* I think all honourable members on this side of the House admire the sorts of comments that have been made by the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi)  in a number of speeches that he has made over a period of months on the energy question and in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0)

* I suggest that what we are really faced with is a choice between allowing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> developments to occur in an unsatisfactory way, as they are occurring at present throughout the world, or of using our position as a responsible supplier of energy resources to bring about greater stability, greater certainty and greater responsibility in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> developments throughout the world.

* It goes beyond it in these respects: The customer non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states must be parties to the nonproliferation treaty involving International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and accept our additional safeguards requirements under the bilateral treaties which they must enter into with us; existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states must agree that Australian uranium will not be used for military purposes and be covered by IAEA safeguards.

* I really find it quite odd that somebody who claims not to want proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons- I admit the claim and I could not conceive of anyone in this House wanting that to happen- and to have the common objective of wanting to prevent the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons should suggest that Australia should behave as though we were on the moon or on another planet and not part of this world.

* In other parts of the Flowers report, indicating a view very similar to that indicated in the Fox report, the Commission had indicated that the present state of knowledge certainly was not one which should cause people to put aside the further development of" <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for peaceful purposes.

* I further note that the Trade Union Congress, as that report indicated, backed a full scale demonstration of fast breeder reactors on grounds that there might be a shortage of uranium and that therefore countries dependent on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for peaceful purposes would need to conserve what supplies of uranium were available to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0)

* It also shows that in the United Kingdom responsible unions, having a considerable number of facts available to them, having a very large number of their members dependent upon energy from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplies, recognise that countries of Europe need uranium for the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for peaceful purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0)

* These two matters together emphasise why the ready availability of Australian uranium is important in order to slow down the move towards fast breeder reactors, if that is possible, and to slow down the move towards the plutonium economy, as well as to give Australia the strongest possible voice in the world forums against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation and in favour of proper waste disposal as modern scientific and technological knowledge now makes possible.

* In fact, the operations of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry around the world have a proven record which is such that all the advice to this Government shows that no member of the public has ever been injured through the operations of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generator.

* One of the few long term projections that the Premier of South Australia grabbed hold of and shook around on several occasions was requests of this Government and I believe of the Whitlam Government to use some source of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power so that desalination methods could be adopted to help the entire State of South Australia to get quality water, if a sufficient quantity could be obtained.

* One of the things that the people are saying- I think that it is a very sensible thing for them to be saying- is that if we had not reached the stage in our technology at which it was possible to produce a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb, it would have been a darned good thing.

* Although <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities may not be immediately needed in the host countries, the exploring countries are likely to offer technology as they are in Brazil for power reactors, together with enrichment and reprocessing plants, in return for a generous slice of whatever uranium is found. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* Whilst it is difficult to gauge the exact effectiveness of an Australian uranium moratorium on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation and terrorism there could well be a beneficial indirect leverage possible on suppliers of sensitive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology who themselves need large supplies of cheap uranium for power reactors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* But the question is whether a blanket 2-year to 5-year export ban with its across the board effect on all consumers can be more useful than the Government's announcement that those <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> nations not agreeing to improved safeguards and restricted technology transfer would selectively miss out on short term and long term supplies of our cheap uranium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0)

* The latter course has the advantage of being more credible, of establishing Australia as a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel supplier accepted with respect in the world's decision making uranium forums, of being more effective against dissident countries such as France and of reflecting our international energy responsibilities.

* It is interesting to note that the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission in the United States and the proposed Atomic Energy Safety Commission in Japan reflect some of the considerations to be taken into account- at present Japan is in the process of splitting the functions into two on the basis of being able to get the safeguards required- bearing in mind the large differences between the activities in those countries and in Australia requiring regulation.

* In addition, it should be cheaper than <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power; it would be well within the production capabilities of Australia, which <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation certainly is not; it would be more amenable to flexibility of siting and power storage to compensate for weather and seasonal fluctuations; and it would be more economically adaptable to evolution from a small generation complex to a large scale one.

* I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with the health and safety of people, and the environment, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* I simply refer to clause 13 to remind the honourable member for Robertson that the right of the Governor-General only accrues when he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons or the environment is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory, and where there is not already legislation enacted to cover the situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Firstly, there is the assault upon civil liberties, and secondly, we are utterly and completely opposed to uranium mining at this stage because there is no known way to dispose of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, and because the safeguards- such as the international atomic energy agency safeguards that the Government is depending upon, and also bilateral agreements and signatories to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation treaty- are just not sufficient to guarantee that Australian uranium will not be used in the manufacture of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* Does sub-clause (6) really mean that if a real <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> hazard did develop- one could easily imagine it, I will put forward a hypothetical situation in a moment- the States could override the Commonwealth, override the wishes of the workers and order that uranium mining could go ahead and must go ahead? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29)

* That is what I think it means, because sub-clause (6) provides that an order made under sub-section ( 1 ) in relation to a situation resulting from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity shall not authorise a Minister to give directions that have effect in a State or to take any action in a State unless the Governor of the State has requested the Governor-General to make an order.

* It seems to me to be a very odd situation that when this Bill was introduced into this chamber- presumably it had been discussed in the party room of the Liberal Party and had received approval- what the Government was contemplating and endorsing in principle and what every honourable member on that side of the chamber voted for was a Bill which not merely gave the Commonwealth the right to prepare and develop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes but gave it that right exclusively.

* The problem which the Government is creating for itself in its determination to go ahead and to get mining under way before the wet season sets in, irrespective of the hazards and irrespective of the problems which that can create for Australia, is such that it is now prepared to throw away any responsibility in terms of operating as a paramount power in the formulation of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code.

* The agreement incorporates all the Government's <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards requirements as announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 24 May 1977. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* These are: an undertaking that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes; the application of International Atomic Energy Agency- IAEA- safeguards, which provide an international check against diversion of material; fall-back arrangements to ensure continued safeguarding of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material should IAEA safeguards for any reason cease to apply; a requirement for Australia's prior consent to any retransfers, to ensure that uranium supplied by Australia cannot be re-exported unless we are satisfied as to the ultimate destination and as to the controls that would apply; a requirement for Australia's prior consent for high enrichment or reprocessing of material supplied by Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* This effectively reserves our position on reprocessing, as we have said we wish to, pending the outcome of international studies, including- INFCE- the International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation; provisions ensuring that adequate physical security will be maintained, to guard against theft or other illegal use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material by groups or individuals; provisions for consultations to ensure the effective implementation of the Agreement; and all these safeguards and controls to cover <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from Australian uranium so long as it remains in a form relevant from the point of view of safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The agreement also contains: a sanctions Article acknowledging Australia's right to suspend supplies and to require return of material in the event of detonation of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device, failure to comply with IAEA safeguards or breach of the agreement; and arbitration procedures for the settlement of disputes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The purpose of the letter is to provide a degree of reassurance to the Republic of Korea of the manner in which Australia intends to exercise its prior consent rights and to handle administrative problems that might arise from multiple labelling, that is the attachment of different national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards conditions to material as it is transferred internationally for processing purposes on its way to the end user. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The letter states Australia's intention of being a reliable supplier and its attitude towards a possible international convention on the physical protection of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Republic of Korea's <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> program is a large one, and envisages over 40 reactors by the year 2000, at which time <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power would account for 60 per cent of electricity generation and 20 per cent of the Republic of Korea 's total energy requirements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The conclusion of this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> co-operation and safeguards agreement with the Republic of Korea provides a basis for shipments of Australian uranium to that country under commercial contracts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Government's <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy is a comprehensive, stringent and highly responsible policy aimed at contributing to the prevention of the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The willingness of potential customer countries to accept Australia's <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards requirements, thorough and stringent as they are, is evidence of this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* In examining the text of this agreement, we note it is essentially the same as the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Safeguards Agreement between Australia and the Philippines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* We note that the document emphasises co-operation in peaceful use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and the transfer of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The title '<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Cooperation ' is more appropriate than safeguards as the intent of this agreement is to pave the way for very substantial co-operation with the Republic of Korea in these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister made clear that the Republic of Korea bases its expansion plans in substantial part on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generation of electricity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* We have discussed with the Foreign Minister in previous debates the details of other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> co-operation agreements during the last session of the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* Since that time, of course, events in the world affecting <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy have not stood still. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* We note, for example, that the Government has extended the appointment of  Mr Justice  Fox as Ambassador-at-large for <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation and Safeguards Matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* Mr Justice  Fox is on record in a paper published in November 1978 by the International Consultative Group on <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy as proposing quite new approaches to the avoidance of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* These proposals reflect a different approach to that evident in the Government's continuing program of negotiating <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards agreements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* We also note that a very senior officer of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, again in a personal capacity, has proposed a quite radical new approach to international <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> co-operative activities for the avoidance of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The decline in confidence in petroleum supplies brought about by events in Iran undoubtedly increases international interest in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The events at Harrisburg, however, have greatly increased public apprehension about the safety of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor operations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* In many of the democracies, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power programs will be set back. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* We note that Sweden will now hold a referendum on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister has told us of the projections by the Republic of Korea of its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor requirements over the next 20 years- 40 reactors requiring 80,000 tons of uranium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The magnitude of the Korean <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> program can be illustrated in comparative terms by saying that the Koreans wish to buy, by the year 2000, a quantity of uranium equal to twice the current annual world market for uranium and five times the amount the  Deputy  Prime Minister would like Australia to be able to export annually by 1988. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* We wish to express the following reservations and concerns about this proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> cooperation agreement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The prospect is that, if the Government were permitted to proceed with its plans on such a basis, we could find ourselves so substantially committed to uranium exports a decade from now that we would be a desperate seller rather than a seller concerned, as we should be, about the safety, environmental, weapons proliferation and waste disposal problems of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The advocates of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy have included two camps: Those who see the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> option as a major long term contributor to energy needs; and those who, especially more recently, have justified <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy as essential to fill an energy deficit which may be upon us in the mid 1980s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The two approaches to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry lead to different conclusions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* If <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry has a long term future, the reviews, adjustments and options made remain relevant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* If, on the other hand, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is supposedly only a stop-gap to be replaced by more benevolent, renewable alternatives several decades from now, we must doubt very much whether <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power now has the viability to be a gap-filler. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* There are reactions against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, but other countries with major <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> programs will continue with these and are likely also to press for exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* At the same time, the Republic of Korea is a country which has quite clearly contemplated the" acquisition of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* In fact, evidence available to the United States Government as far back as 1976 led it to bring pressure to bear on France and on Korea to prevent the export of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reprocessing plan t by France to Korea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* That pressure also culminated in the Republic of Korea becoming a party to the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty after many years of avoidance of that commitment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The facts remain that, firstly, South Korea is a country with an understandably great concern for its defence and which cannot be considered to have excluded from its future plans the acquinon of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> NonProliferation Treaty provides for withdrawal of any country 'if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardised the supreme interests of its country'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* Secondly, neither the Treaty tabled today, nor the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty would prevent the Republic of Korea- or any other country similarly bound by Treaty- from accumulating over time and within its so-called peaceful' <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, both the materials usable for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the technology and skills for converting that material into weapons in less time than the three months required for withdrawal from the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> NonProliferation Treaty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* That is, if the Republic of Korea withdrew from the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> NonProliferation Treaty and from the safeguards regime, and if it further declined to accept the full scope safeguards required, Australia would have the capacity to exercise its safeguards or retrieval rights only in respect of, say, 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* That country is nonetheless a country with an interest in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* It must also be noted that since the subject of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation was last debated in the Parliament in November 1978, announcements by the Deputy Prime Minister about uranium sales contracts have made even more clear than was then the case that the Government regards the safeguards as little more than a political cosmetic to facilitate exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* Finally, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exports policy is now unqualifiedly in the hands of the  Deputy  Prime Minister, who we say is not competent to manage this policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0)

* A bilateral <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards agreement has recently been concluded, opening the way for negotiations for the supply of Australian uranium to the Philippines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-53-0)

* These make Australia a prime <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> target as part of a world-wide network which aims to provide the US with a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> first-strike capacity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0)

* I asked whether failure to ratify the Agreement would have consequences of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0)

* By that I meant proliferation by the Americans and the Russians and with new weapons by other countries acquiring <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capability. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0)

* If the bases in Australia are part of a system sustaining stability and moving towards arms control and reduction in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, clearly they have a positive value. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0)

* If, however, the strategic balance is upset and the guidelines under which they operate change, if there is an escalation in the arms race, a proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states and an increased risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war, any sensible Australian Government will have to consider what will happen to the bases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0)

* We approve of nonproliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0)

* Yet we never hear a word about the Soviet Union or the East European countries which are pushing ahead with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation as fast as they can. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-14-0)

* It is all right for a few people who want to get round in a loin cloth or to live up a tree to live without <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, but the great bulk of the people look to the future so that their children can have a standard of living comparable to ours. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-14-0)

* The work on which  Mr Justice  Fox has been engaged as Ambassador-at-Large for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards is, in the view of the Government, work of great national importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* After all, it was the Australian Labor Party when in government which appointed Justice Fox to head the inquiry into uranium mining and export- generally the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industryand I believe his report was one of the more significant contributions towards the information of the public mind on this subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* While the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  has indicated that the Opposition has no objection in principle to the appointment of  Mr Justice  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, on the very important question of an examination of the processes of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, we do not believe that the question of the extension of his appointment ought just simply to be an exercise to be taken by the Executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* His  functions are to examine the range of arguments, the range of developments and the complexities of the problems which confront mainly those nations of Western society which seem to have been committed to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and to inform, not merely the Government of Australia on the range of those matters - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Government believes that so long as it can keep  Mr Justice  Fox as ambassador-at-large wandering around the world he can produce as many memoranda as he likes, he can tell the Government of the problems and the threats that are posed to the people of Australia by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> profliferation, he can tell the people of Australia and the Government that we have not solved the problems of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal, he can point out all these problems, but they will stay within the confines of the Cabinet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* I only hope that the recommendations he has made, which the Minister would not allow to be tabled because they highlight the essential dishonesty of this Government's policy on the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, will continue to be made, not merely to the executive arm of Government but also to the Parliament and, through the Parliament, to the people of Australia.

* I remind honourable members that the statement continued by saying that Australia 's efforts to halt the growth in existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon stockpiles have been no less intensive as it continues to emphasise the responsibility of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons states to engage in effective <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms control through negotiations such as SALT and the Comprehensive <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Test Ban Treaty.
