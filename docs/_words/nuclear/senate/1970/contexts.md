* On this subject, the Conference expressed the following three major concerns: the need to cease immediately all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the atmosphere; the need to obtain as soon as possible a comprehensive test ban; and, the need to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of storing radio-active wastes before developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission energy plants on a large scale.

* That factor alone, in view of the colossal investment involved by the wealthy nations in developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, ought to be something that we recognise as we wrestle with the problem.

* I do not believe that any person would argue that under no circumstances should our uranium be developed for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and exported but, at the same time, it is perfectly clear to all of us, and the Fox report makes it clear, that there are as yet unsolved problems with the disposal of waste, plutonium, accidents, war, terrorism and all the rest of the dangers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* If we consider that picture as a whole we can see that there would be a tremendous potential for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power around the world and where, as  Mr Justice  Fox points out, it can be shown that the development of the industry will not be harmful to mankind we ought to avail ourselves of it.

* I do not wish to quote them all -there is simply not time- but he emphasised the dangers of radiation at all stages of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, the nature of plutonium and the possibility of its creating diseases in human beings, the general problem of waste and the associated difficulties that go with it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* I believe that we have no alternative but to go ahead and look for further energy sources, and in that regard perhaps I could quote from the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry in which  Mr Justice  Fox deals with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and alternatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0)

* I hope that we as a nation and other nations will do much more research in it because I believe that solar energy, with its cleanliness, will be the great energy giver to the world in years to come; but in the interim period there is this energy gap about which we have been talking and we have to turn to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy.

* To give an example of these dangers I again quote from the paper by  Mr Bernard  L. Cohen, where he states: since our country - that is, America- needs a power plant for every half million people, and a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant kills an average of 0.01 people per year, an individual's probability of being killed by a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant is one chance in50 million per year.

* So many reliable countries are doing so much research at this time and are acting responsibly that one cannot fully accept the fear campaign with regard to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, even though I accept that there are still problems associated with its disposal.

* Leaving aside questions respecting terrorism, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes and proliferation, our assessment of the position is that while the operations of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry need close regulation and constant surveillance, they probably do not entail risks greater in sum than those inherent in alternative energy industries.

* A proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities without adequate protection against diversion of material to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosives would pose serious threats to international stability and peace, obviously inimical to Australia's interests and to global and regional security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* It was for this reason that in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last September, the Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  described the strengthening of measures to prevent proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons as a central and fundamental area in which Australia looks and hopes for early progress. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* I make clear from the outset that the term safeguards is used here to denote the whole range of measures used to provide assurance that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied for peaceful purposes is not misused for non-peaceful or explosive purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* It would not be desirable for safeguards requirements to be left to  ad hoc  decision as this would not afford the strong and clear support for international efforts to strengthen controls against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation to which the Government attaches major importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Australia is a potentially significant supplier of uranium, but if we are to play the part which this potential gives us the opportunity to play of contributing effectively to international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, it is desirable that uranium importing countries and other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries alike know where Australia stands on the matter of safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In the narrow sense, safeguards are systems of containment, surveillance, accounting and inspection of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials and facilities designed to verify that diversion does not take place from peaceful to non-peaceful or explosive purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In a broader sense, safeguards for future Australian uranium exports would comprise, as well as the application of international safeguards in this strict sense, the securing from importing countries of adequate assurances regarding the use and control of supplied <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material and the conclusion of binding arrangements to give effect to such assurances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In both senses- as mechanisms for verification and as controls and conditions for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exports- safeguards arrangements are an evolving structure, continually being strengthened, refined and improved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In this regard the Government is pleased that, as recently announced,  Mr Justice  Fox has agreed to become an adviser to me on policy matters relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In the case of non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states- that is to say all countries other than the 5 existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons powers recognised by the NonProliferation Treaty- sales will be made only to countries which are parties to the NonProliferation Treaty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Because of these countries' safeguards obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty this policy will ensure that the entire civil <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in such customer countries is subject to effective safeguards to verify that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, whether of Australian or any other origin, is not diverted from peaceful uses. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The Government is aware that work has recently been underway within the International Atomic Energy Agency on a new system of equality stringent safeguards to cover the entire <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states which are not parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Regarding existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states, they are not obliged under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to renounce <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or accept international safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* They retain the right to use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material for weapons as well as peaceful purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Even so, Australia would want to have assurance that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material we may supply for peaceful purposes is not diverted to military or explosive purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* We will therefore export only to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the uranium we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* These bilateral agreements will provide a framework for direct and binding assurances by importing countries to the Australian Government in relation to the use and control of uranium supplied by Australia or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from uranium importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Fifth, the Government takes the view that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use should remain under safeguards for the full life of the material in question or until it is legitimately removed from safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In line with this basic principle the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states should make provision for so-called fallback safeguards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Further, the bilateral agreements should provide for Australia to make alternative arrangements for the safeguarding of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by us in the event of international safeguards as such ceasing to operate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Moreover, the Government feels it is reasonable to ask importing countries who will already accept International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards of comprehensive scope under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to accept that, at the first fallback level also, international safeguards should apply to all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, not just that portion supplied by Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Sixth, the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for uranium supplied by Australia to one country, or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use, to be able to be reexported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* This provision will give Australia the means of ensuring that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the uranium we supply or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* This provision is in line with the practice adopted by other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries The figure of 20 per cent has been chosen as representing a level of enrichment below the practical requirements fora <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive, while being above the enrichment level required for most peaceful uses, excepting, for example, some research and radioisotope production reactors, for which approval to enrich to the necessary level would need to be obtained. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Eighth, the Government is aware of the interest of some countries in the reprocessing of spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel to meet their anticipated future fuel requirements, and to facilitate the management of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material following its use in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* At the present time the need for reprocessing and the details of an effective control regime for this area of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle are the subject of close study internationally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The United States has proposed an International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program to consider various <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycles in terms of their implications for proliferation control. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The Government's view is that, prior to a clearer outcome emerging from this current international activity it would be premature for Australia to adopt a unilateral position on the detailed conditions under which we might be prepared to agree to reprocessing, if any, of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In order to effectively reserve Australia's position on this matter for the time being we would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian uranium that any reprocessing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* Ninth, the Government would require in future bilateral agreements the assurance from uranium importing countries that adequate physical security will be maintained on their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The incorporation of these provisions in the Government 's safeguards policy reflects our concern that total <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> control should encompass not just safeguards to verify that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material is not illicitly diverted from peaceful uses by national governments or national authorities, but also to protect <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material from illegal use by groups or individuals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* We too consider that it is highly desirable that there should be the widest possible consensus amongst both <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> importing countries on the controls to apply to the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The wider the consensus, the more effective these controls will be as a barrier to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* More generally, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries have a special role and responsibility in the ongoing development of safeguards and Australia will be prepared to participate with them in any constructive efforts to develop a co-ordinated approach. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* At the present time the Government sees a multilateral approach towards safeguards questions as being especially desirable in one specific area as well as the International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program already mentioned; we would wish to lend support to the development of an international convention on the physical protection of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in international transit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries- both uranium importers and major <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exporters- and relevant international organisations including the International Atomic Energy Agency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The policy goes beyond a mere acceptance by Australian of our international obligations as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and constitutes a policy as stringent as that adopted to date by any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier country.

* I sought that information and I now offer the following advice that I have received: The Prime Minister wrote to all Premiers on 3 1 August 1 977 concerning the Government's decision to develop a uniform code of practice to apply to all uranium mining activities in Australia and to any future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25)

* My Government has decided to accept this recommendation but to go further and, together with the States, to establish by legislation a uniform national Code which covers all aspects of mining and milling of uranium as well as any future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0)

* The opportunity is also being taken to strengthen and clarify the legislative basis for the application of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards within Australia in accordance with the agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Australia in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* As honourable senators would be aware, Australia ratified the Treaty on the NonProliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons on 23 January 1973. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* By ratifying this most important international instrument, Australia undertook, amongst other things, not to manufacture or acquire <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive safeguards and to accept safeguards applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency covering all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in all peaceful <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities within Australia, under our jurisdiction or carried out anywhere under our control. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Furthermore, following the announcement by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977 of Australia's policy on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards to apply to exports of Australian uranium, Australia will be entering into government to government bilateral agreements with customer countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* The object of this Bill is to establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the environment, from possible harmful effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities here in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* We noted particularly the very specialised nature of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, the likelihood of potential hazards involved in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle and the limited extent of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia at present. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* After considering all these factors carefully, the Government decided to regulate and control <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia by codes of practice and to legislate to enable such codes to be approved following consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, to be implemented through the laws of a State or Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* It will enable governments to ensure that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia is so regulated as to afford the utmost protection to people and the environment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* They include standards to be observed, practice and procedures to be followed, and other measures, such as licensing and supervision, relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with health and safety of people, and the environment, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* We have established a national system of accounting for and controlling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material as required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty and by our safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Clause 11 authorises the making of regulations to carry out, give effect to, or secure the observance of, the code in a State or Territory where, in the opinion of the GovernorGeneral the law of that State or Territory does not regulate or control <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in the manner prescribed in the code of practice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Should any unforeseen situation arise as a result of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity, which is not regulated or controlled by a Commonwealth, State or Territory law, and which is likely to affect health, safety or the environment, the GovernorGeneral will have power, under clause 1 3 of the Bill, to authorise the appropriate Federal Minister to act to control hazards associated with the situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Orders made under the provisions of this clause have effect only in relation to situations likely to affect health and safety, or the environment, that arises from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities, as defined in the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* 
 Mr President, I do want to stress that the provisions of clause 13 apply only when no Commonwealth, State or Territory law exists to control a potentially hazardous situation arising from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity, as defined in this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is responsible environmental legislation that will provide for the development of protection measures in respect to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0)

* Lack of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes Bill to ensure public participation in framing codes will threaten all environmental legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It will also oppose and seek to amend the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Our opposition is based mainly on the weapons proliferation danger and, probably more importantly, on the disposal of waste- on the fact that no safe technology exists for the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Reinforcing the Government's policy is a claim that the guidelines established by the Government make the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology acceptably safe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* More importantly, on the matter of waste disposal I want to make this point: If the Government really believed that there was safe technology for the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste and if it wished to maximise Australian control over uranium which might be exported from Australia it would insist upon- not just allowthe spent fuel rods from reactors being stored in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* It demonstrates very clearly that the Government lacks faith in its assertion about the alleged acceptability of the risks entailed with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* As an aside to that argument I mention that if in fact the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste were stored in Australia it would maximise the employment generating potential of the move into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I do not believe that the Government's assertions of the alleged safety of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology are accurate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* However, I can conceive that at some stage it might be necessary to move into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In my judgment, it is not acceptably safe to move into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology now, given the other options that we have and, in particular, given the fact that the world has sufficient coal to supply energy needs for at least 100 years and probably for 200 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I also mention that some of the people who are opposed very strongly to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy see the issue in terms of a capitalist plot. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* They say that the capitalist system is attempting to impose <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology on the rest of the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in particular, Yugoslavia and the People's Republic of China also are moving into the widespread use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I think that the opponents of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy would make their case more credible if they would mention that fact more often. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* A feature which is common to the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, in both capitalist and communist countries, to use rather crude terms, is that it has a military application. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* That is the reason <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy has been developed and why so much money has been spent on research and development in those countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In particular, Russia, which is probably the world's worst <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> vandal, ought to be censured by the opponents of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* General objections to the mining of uranium or to the movement into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle aside, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill is a most unsatisfactory piece of legislation to use as a vehicle for Government policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* As I said at the beginning, I am not going to say very much about the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Indeed, the Bill demonstrates very well just how ignorant we are of the whole question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety and waste disposal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In brief, the amendments are, firstly, to necessitate a public inquiry before the confirmation of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes; secondly, to establish an environmental protection advisory council independent of government control; and, thirdly, to require that codes not be confirmed until after public inquiry and findings have been reported to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* For the reasons I have stated with regard to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the defence powers of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* At this time when people are racing around the world holding secret conferences, when the tensions of the world are such that members of the general public are not being fully informed of what is going on and when  deputy  heads of state can visit a country for what are almost clandestine meetings, it can be seen that there is a great deal more in uranium mining and the future use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power than meets the eye.

* The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and the government have been saying for years that they think there is a solution for radioactive waste disposal for 200 or 500 thousand years, but they haven 't found it, and one of the reasons they haven 't found it is because it's probably the most extraordinarily difficult technological solution ever devised in our civilian economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* There is enough radioactive waste now, enough plutonium in the United States and other countries to produce hundreds of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs or if they are exposed to the atmosphere to destroy hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people, so that that's the criteria by which we judge whether there should have been radioactive waste disposal solved before the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants were on line.

* If it can be proved that the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste is foolproof, if it can be proved that there is a means of disposal so that the waste will not be a menace to people employed in the industry and so that it will not be used by people of evil intent for waging war against their fellow man, and if it can be proved that the substance will not be used by terrorists who wish to gain some temporary advantage, then civilisation will continue into the future.

* The second Bill, the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, is mainly a machinery Bill which will allow us, when the mines commence, to lay down certain regulations under which the rnining operations can take place and which will allow for safeguards, for the men working there and those who would be involved down the line in transport and other ancillaries.

* I know that I express the feelings and the ideas of the majority of the members of the Party which I represent in the Senate when I say that I consider that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is too potentially and actually dangerous, indeed hazardous, to be used to any great extent at the present time.

* Whilst on the one hand mouthing pious sentiments about the need for consultation between State and Federal governments before codes are proclaimed or enforced, the Government has so worded the clauses of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill and the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act that, in fact, the States have no rights at all.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* I will refer only to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978 which I will call the 'code' Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The extreme definition of '<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities' is therein stated to include the mining of any prescribed substance; the production of any prescribed substance; the milling, refining, treatment and processing of any prescribed substance; and the construction, operation or decommissioning of a mine, plant and so on associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The code of practice is as extensive as this: It may specify the standards to be observed, recommend practices and procedures to be followed; make provision for or in relation to the prohibition of the doing of any act or thing that is, in whole or in part, a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity; make provision for the licensing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities; make provision for giving directions to particular persons for the purposes of the code; and make provision for and in relation to exemptions from the application of any provision of the code.

* On a textual interpretation of the amendment I regret that the States have not been visibly involved in consultation up until this time but my theme is that the States, having regard to the national character of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity, ought instantly, except as to the question of actual mining, refer all other questions of power to the Commonwealth.

* Under that Bill the Commonwealth Minister must cause codes of practice regulating or controlling all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity in Australia, including mining, processing, transport, acquisition and disposal, to be sent to all State Ministers and to the Northern Territory Minister for their comments.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Let me refer first to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill which is an unusual piece of legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the environment, from possible harmful effects associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Before dealing with the criticisms of it, with regard to the general legislation, I must say that I am not persuaded that there is danger in the adoption of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* He pointed out that in fact it does not behove this country to stand apart, to leave the uranium in the ground and not to exercise an influence on the protection and handling of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel throughout the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Of course the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry basically justifies our going ahead with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> endeavours. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* We can appreciate that the Parliament is not in a position to lay down detailed codes, detailed material whereby it can be determined from point to point how <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity should be controlled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* One of the important recommendations of that Committee was that the Commonwealth Parliament should be empowered by constitutional amendment to make laws with respect, firstly, to the manufacture of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels and the generation and use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and, secondly, to ionising radiation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* I believe that the Bill itself is deficient in failing to provide a machinery for full consultation with the States in formulating proper controls of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Clause 1 3 of the Bill gives powers to the Governor-General to deal with special situations if he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons, or the environment, are likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory.

* This is in part because it is proposed that the Commission be actively engaged as entrepreneur, and in part because one of its ordinary roles is the promotion of uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development generally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* It is clear that the Government is long since committed to a course that will require the use and development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and I would not be a party to avoiding the strategy which the Government has adopted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Nonetheless, I support the general decision of the Government in respect of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and consequently support the package of Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* To requests by State governments for withdrawal of the legislation to enable reconsideration, the Prime Minister has responded that sections 1 1 and 13 of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, should not commence in relation to the States until the views of the States have been considered.

* If by denial of our uranium to the world for use in slow water reactors we force nations through scarcity to turn uranium to plutonium which can give indefinite sources of energy, we then by our action lead them, even incite them, into making fissile materials for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons.

* The Congressional report also finds itself in agreement with a recent study by the Rand Corporationa Californian-based 'think tank'- that the cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is climbing astronomically and that this cost spiral and the waste problem are already causing some American States to back away from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power development.

* As  Senator Walsh  has pointed out, the effect of the Government's proposed amendments to clauses 1 1 and 1 3 would be to provide that Australia would have a uniform code on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety and environmental protection, only if certain circumstances arose; namely, if the State governments request the Governor-General, and thereby the Commonwealth Government, to proclaim a code in respect of the territorial areas of their States.

* Policy respecting Australian uranium exports, for the time being at least, should be based on a full recognition of the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and should therefore seek to limit or restrict expansion of that production.

* Against that background may I say that following correspondence between the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the States regarding the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill Commonwealth and State Ministers met in Canberra on 1 8 May of this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* I am advised that the discussions between officials indicated that the States were most concerned about two of the six Bills introduced into the Parliament last month- the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* The officials indicated that the States saw these particular Bills as raising the possibility of Commonwealth intrusion into areas of State responsibilities in respect of uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, that the Bills were seen as being of doubtful constitutional validity, that their passage raised the issue of constitutional impropriety with the Commonwealth resiling from its cooperative federalism policy, and that the Bills lacked specific arrangements for Commonwealth/State consultation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* I understand however that there was more or less general State agreement on the need for a system of uniform national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes which might possibly be applied by way of complementary legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* We would expect that this action by the Commonwealth will facilitate consultative arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth so that a system of uniform <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes can be drawn up and applied nationally by way of complementary legislation if that is the most satisfactory procedure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* Because it is important for us to understand the situationI say with the best of goodwill that, if the Federal Opposition were to go through copies of  Hansard  of recent days, it would find that the main thrust of its opposition to this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes Bill was directed to the allegation that there had not been full discussion or cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* These amendments should not be seen as a weakening of the Government's resolve to achieve, in co-operation with the States, effective and uniform regulation and control of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities insofar as those activities affect the health, safety and environment of Australians.

* Despite the fact that we have had restated again today the claims about this Government's intention to achieve a national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code, the Government is now to introduce amendments, which we will deal with later, that will open the way for a disaster to occur in relation to the formulation of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* What I am really concerned about- I cannot find mention of it in the Bill- is whether there are any safeguards in the legislation to prevent a country like Japan from trying, because it relies to a great extent on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and no doubt will enter into contracts with  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  and  Sir Charles  Court with the sanction of this Government's granting an export licence, to return to Queensland or Western Australia boatloads of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste for burial in the backblocks as has been suggested.

* All honourable senators know that the whole thrust of the Labor Senate Opposition's argument in the earlier weeks of the debate on the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill was that the Government had been recreant in not consulting the States and that it was imperative that the States should be consulted fully and their views sought and understood, presumably so that a consensus could be reached.

* Did the assertion in his answer that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is in fact competitive with other fuels take into account two factors- firstly, the cost, which apparently is very high, of the demolition of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations past their useful life and, secondly, the cost of the permanent and safe disposal of radioactive waste resulting from both the operation and the demolition of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations?

* I suggest that, if the Government were as genuinely concerned about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety and environmental responsibility as it purports to be, this would be an absolute priority area for its attention and would be at the top of its priority list in terms of additional staff rather than as shown here, apparently at the bottom, and one of the first areas to be adversely affected by the operation of the present staff ceilings.

* That might well mean, for example, if a different view is developed in this country on the whole question of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor waste, and so on, that no steps could be taken in relation to this authority to mine which would alter the conditions that are now in it.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0)
