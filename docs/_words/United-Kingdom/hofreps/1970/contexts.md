* But on the question of addiction may I commend to the Minister, and invite him to respond to me in his reply, this aspect: As he knows, late last year as Minister for Customs and Excise I visited the United States of America, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and other parts of Europe to study the methods being employed in those countries to contain the spread of drug abuse.

* I commend to my Government the system now in use in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, where drug addiction is regarded as an illness rather than as a crime. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0)

* I recommended, and it was accepted by my Government, that a top level team consisting of Government advisers should visit the United States, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe, particularly Holland and Denmark, with a view to studying this technique of treating drug addiction.

* Lastly, concerning pharmaceutical products, once again I will not read all of my statement but will say simply that the Committee recommends that the Australian Government should negotiate with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> companies that export intal, lyndiol and ovostat with a view to recouping some of the benefits lost to this country at the time of upvaluation.

* A  Dr Lawson  some years ago wrote that the tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy rate in Australia for doctors paid on a fee for service basis was seven per one thousand, whereas in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States where doctors are paid salaries the rate was 3.6 per thousand.

* Coming to some of the other matters that were mentioned, I noted that the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  spoke of the problem of air mails, but I ask him to bear in mind that this country, which is in the southern hemisphere, has to run air mails right across the world before it gets into the other areas of business, whether it be in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Canada or the United States of America.

* One of the things that happened with the change of administration and my own assumption of office was that I cancelled the advertising program which had been running, I thought on wrong lines, in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and on which in 1971-72 we spent $522,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0)

* If we starve the States as a deliberate process and policy and feed local government as a deliberate policy we reach a stage where one part of the Federal Constitution, the States, are destroyed and another part, local government, is built up in their place so that we replace our federal form of government with the kind of government which exists in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> where they have one central government at Westminster and county councils, borough councils and so forth administering details in the regions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17)

* It is not new nationalism but old-style aggressive nationalism, a petulant self-assertiveness that has already harmed relations with the United States, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Singapore, the South Pacific countries and Japan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0)

* But, as I have said, as a result of the amendments forced upon the Government by the Opposition in the Senate, as from 1 December settlers from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and any of the other British Commonwealth of Nations countries will be required to renounce their allegiance in the oath sworn at such citizenship ceremonies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0)

* Certainly these amending Acts had to secure passage through States Parliaments, but if there had been powers of direction in the Act similar to those now inserted, the farmers would have been left with the alternative of accepting an admittedly unfair price for stockfeed, or meeting the bill of costs for sea freight to Tasmania on the whole of the wheat used there, presently about 3/6d per bushel, or almost as much as freight to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>.

* It retained its original title through 4 amendments between 1909 and 1952, but by 1957 the post World War II expansion of Australian diplomatic representation was reflected in a change of name to the High Commissioner (<span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>) Act.

* The second matter is one of concern, that is, the degree to which an office such as that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> seems to have applied the laws of Parkinson and developed to such a large degree an administrative base which we are told today will be extended so that all the officers currently engaged will continue in employment.

* One is aware also of the industrial trouble caused by so many of those who have become shop stewards and agitators on the industrial front in Australia, and who unfortunately have had a base in the trade union movement in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and seem to have brought to Australia prejudices which are not part of the Australian tradition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0)

* I also query the degree to which it is necessary for that full complement of personnel to be maintained in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, given the different orientation of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> within an enlarged Europe and given the different relationship which Australia has to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in this day and age. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0)

* One wonders whether, given the different relationship, the different posture and the different commitment between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, perhaps we could have employed a firm of management consultants and could have halved the number of personnel who are today employed by the Australian High Commission.

* One recognises the tremendous contribution that those who have served there in the past have made to this country's relations with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and to Australia's relations with the rest of the world, but I doubt whether at this stage there is any need to maintain such a large staff.

* One hopes that from this legislation will come a fairly comprehensive review not only of the staffing itself but also of the role of the staff, to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment more nearly relate to the circumstances of Australia and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in 1973 and the years to come.

* One hopes that, in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> or anywhere else in, the world, these State Agents-General will recognise the degree to which, by co-ordination and co-operation with those officers who represent the Australian Government in the diplomatic or commercial areas, so much more can be achieved.
