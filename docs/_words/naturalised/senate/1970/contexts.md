## Contexts in which the word **naturalised** was used in the Senate during the 1970s

* It is also assumed in the information I give that  Senator Mulvihills  question refers to <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians of Yugoslav origin. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0)

* Could he give the nature of these new issues and could he also state why this Parliament had not previously been informed of any action to protect Australian <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens in Yugoslavia subsequent to that raid into Yugoslavia? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0)

* Attorney-General that 3 <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians who were originally Croatians had been executed, will the Attorney-General inform the Senate, firstly, where that conversation took place and, secondly, whether other matters were mentioned during that conversation; also, will he now give to the Senate in substance the whole of that conversation?

* This matter should be dealt with promptly, because if we are to secure migrants we will have to give social service rights to migrants who have been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0)

* Do a number of these persons have other children who are not only resident in Australia, but, indeed, are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians, and does this policy discriminate against certain people, in that those who have no children can be admitted to Australia, but those with children who are minors are refused admission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* On the question of land rights I point out that land rights are given to <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> British subjects from almost all countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0)

* The Bill describes them as 'certain other persons' which means certain <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians and the Australian born offspring of migrants who require English instruction.

* I ask him whether he will look into whether the law can be altered to provide that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be liable to deportation or cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of substantial fraud in the application for citizenship? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-27-0)

* I rise to refer to a matter that was raised originally on 19th August when
                 Senator Murphy  asked a question of the newly
              appointed Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  in
              relation to whether the law could be altered to provide that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians
              shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be liable to deportation or
              cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of substantial fraud in the
              application for citizenship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* The proposal was that
            <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians should be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be
            liable for deportation or cancellation of citizenship except for substantial fraud in
            application for citizenship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* I think, however, before one examines what is involved in the
              proposition, that it is important to recognise that there is a period of time, between
              when a migrant comes into this country and when he is <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and therefore
              becomes an Australian citizen, when he is liable to deportation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* I think that section 13 of the Act indicates
              that a person who is in Australia, not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and therefore not an Australian
              citizen, who commits certain specific offences which are set out in the legislation,
              is liable to deportation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* I am dealing with the position between when he comes into the country and when
                he becomes <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* The question which was asked of me
            by  Senator Murphy  on 19th August last was a question
            which in general terms asked me to look into whether the law can be altered to provide
            that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not
            liable for deportation or cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of
            substantial fraud in the application for citizenship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* I should say in passing
            that there are provisions contained in the Citizenship Act at present whereby
            citizenship can be taken away from a person who has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> if there is fraud
            in the application which was made for the citizenship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* I
            would believe that we are in a position where, if a person is an Australian citizen,
            whether he be an Australian citizen by the fact that he has been born in Australia or
            whether he is an Australian citizen by virtue of the fact that he has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>,
            there ought to be an equality of treatment and these provisions do offend against that
            concept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0)

* Just recently I read of a Greek migrant in Melbourne who had made application on 7 occasions to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and who, on 7 occasions, was refused in spite of the fact that he had been in this country for 39 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0)

* Yet this Government insists further that he shall not be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0)

* and (c) The Annual Return to Parliament of persons granted Australian citizenship during 1970-71 by virtue of the grant of certificates of citizenship under Sections 15 and 12 of the Citizenship Act, 1948-1969, provides both a breakdown on a nationality basis of the 27,343 persons <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, and the countries of origin of the 7,750 persons who were registered as Australian citizens.

* The classic area of double standards, however, involves the cases of Greeks and Spaniards either <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or unnaturalised who approach Commonwealth parliamentarians with problems which involve their dependants in those countries.

* It should be reiterated that the new provisions apply equally to all migrants, whether <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or not, as well as to all Australians whether or not they are migrants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-0)

* In view of the recent misunderstanding that occurred over a French army call-up notice served on French-born <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian  Mr Thomas  Gable, can the Minister supply a list of nations who can or do make such a claim on people born in such countries, but who are now Australian citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* This is because they do not, under Greek law, lose their Greek citizenship when they are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-71-0)
