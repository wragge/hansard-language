* The other point I would like to make is this: I think the Australian people were tired of the situation that existed for so many years in relation to Aboriginal policy when the States contended that the Commonwealth had the money and the Commonwealth contended that it did not have the necessary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power.

* Of course, there has been an immediate and pained reaction from the various States but the hard truth is that this Government has only itself to blame because it has ignored the repeated warnings of the Opposition as to what the true legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position is, was and always has been, that is, that the Australian national Government has the sole and the sovereign paramount right to decide what is to be done in the way of production of oil and natural gas in particular, the terms under which it is to be produced, the areas which are to be allocated to the producers and, above all, the ultimate price that is to be paid by the consumers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0)

* What we want is a government which believes in a proper rationing of available funds st reasonable rates of interest, a government which will see that those funds are devoted to the needs of people in housing rather than in more wasteful investments as at present, and a government which will, as I suggested earlier, act on the report of the 1959 Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, a report which, incidentally, was brought out by members from both sides of the Parliament and which recommends ways of giving the necessary powers for the necessary economic planning.

* Like other honourable members I am aware that there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> impediments in relation to the control of prices, services and wages but surely if this Parliament is to have the power it should have to guide the destiny of this country it must have separate power over wages and separate power over prices and services.

* This will mean that, instead of acting in any way instead of the State legislation, this Bill will supplement the powers that are held by the several States and consequently will enable, in respect of all those areas that are within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth, action to be taken against ships where there is either pollution or threat of pollution.

* I came quite clearly to the conclusion, which I still hold without any doubt, that the appointment of Assistant Ministers - they receiving no emolument for performing the duties they will perform - offends against nothing in the Constitution and offends against no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention or principle.

* I think, in a strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense, there would be some difficulty in levying that tax, as a State tax, upon Commonwealth instrumentalities, but apparently the Commonwealth Government is doing what it regards as the decent thing for once and is voluntarily making liable for a tax that constitutionally could not be collected a set of bodies which is listed in a document called the 'Attachment'.

* The conciliation and arbitration system was based on  4  fundamental principles which, to me, still appear to be valid - firstly, that industrial disputes can be settled most equitably and reasonably by a process of conciliation and, if that does not work out, by an independent adjudication based on the merits of the dispute and not on the parties concerned; secondly, it is a fundamental principle of conciliation and arbitration that neither side should be able to use superior bargaining or economic strength to coerce the other party in the dispute or in the arbitration; thirdly, it is held that, insofar as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties permit, the protection of the system should be available to all with impartiality and with equitability; and, fourthly, it is held that the community should not suffer through the inability of sections or groups to reconcile their differences.

* I have perhaps dwelt for too long on the problems of internal waters, but they are quite obviously very complex legal problems; and the considerations which I have canvassed will at some stage have to be faced by our courts because of the singularly unhelpful nature of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure.

* Honourable members will see that these 2 Bills and the Bill we are now considering contain a vast extension of Commonwealth powers and that if the High Court upholds the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Bills and there is any inconsistency between the Commonwealth and State laws then, to the extent of that inconsistency, the Commonwealth laws will prevail.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0)

* As importantly, the Government believes that this legislation goes far towards achieving the basic principles of the Labor Party's platform on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters which reads as follows: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0)

* The bad features of the Bill, not that they will be realised immediately, but the way in which they can become bad, is by an erosion of the States, and if that happens the federal compact which we have and which is the basis of Australia's <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure will be destroyed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0)

* If this Bill is wrongly used, it will result not only in bad <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice but also in bad public administration principles for it will move to the centre all policy decisions and the States will cease to be involved with policy.

* Firstly, the Australian Government sought and gained a voice for local government at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0)

* Therefore, the announcement made by the Minister is an essential step to safeguard the needs of the people of Western Australia and to satisfy the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements of the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-48-0)

* Western Australia, of course, is entitled to an additional seat and quite obviously a redistribution is required to satisfy the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements of the Act and to cater for the need of the people of Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-48-0)

* The late McMahon Government failed to carry out its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty, which it could have carried out, and it deprived Western Australia of the tenth seat to which it was entitled because of the voting pattern in the federal election of 1969 and the State election which followed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-48-0)

* So it is quite clear that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for local governments lies with the State governments and whatever we do as a Commonwealth Government has to take this aspect into consideration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0)

* I believe that the appropriate place to do that would be at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review convention later this year, when we will have to consider what the relationship is going to be between the Commonwealth and local government authorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0)

* I suggest that the theory or the assumption that there is a mandate for everything mentioned in a policy speech is a false theory or a false assertion in terms of political science or in terms of our own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0)

* When the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention is held later this year there will be direct representation from local government and they will be asking for direct representation at meetings of the Australian Loan Council so that this inequity that has existed over all these years when councils have not been able to get proper loan money to carry out their functions and to provide for the needs of their areas will be removed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0)

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: whilst recognising the need for additional funds for local government bodies in Australia, the House is of opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide that the grants scheme is compatible with the Australian Federal system and safeguards the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship between the Commonwealth, States and local government and also ensures (i) no opportunity for circumvention of the States and (ii) the grant of additional funds to local authorities throughout Australia to the extent of not less than five per cent of Commonwealth income tax revenue within 3 years, with lesser sums available each year before then, commencing during the year 1973-74. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* This proposed legislation is the most striking method of taking away the powers of the States without direct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change and to that extent it is dishonest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* On the contrary, it is evident that Commonwealth governments of all political persuasions, in the security of their control of the financial resources of the country, are coming more and more to recognise section 96 as the means of enabling them to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations on Commonwealth power, and as a strong stick with which to beat the States into accepting the role of executive agents for Commonwealth-conceived policies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I have 3 reasons for opposing this measure: Firstly, I believe that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the proposal is, at best, very doubtful; certainly I believe it to be unconstitutional. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* First of all as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the proposal, speaking as a layman on a legal matter, in contradistinction to my learned friends the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  and the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who have put arguments to the House, as I read it section 122 of the Constitution allows the representation of a Territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which the Parliament thinks fit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* This is the fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* This is a very restrictive and carefully drawn section of the Constitution and I think it makes it clear that this Parliament is constitutionally incapable of conferring on the people represented in the Senate - whether they represent the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate - the right to vote in the Senate or, indeed, to be senators. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bar to the representation with full voting rights of the Territories in this House but there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bar, I would think, to the representation of those Territories in the other House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* Since members of the Territories are constitutionally capable of being represented in this House, they are capable also of voting in it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* I do not think that the Government really has turned its mind to the difficult <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions involved in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* It has been misled by the fact that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bar or difficulty in putting members of the Territories as representatives in this House but there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bar to putting them as senators in the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* After all, the Constitution was drafted by lawyers but there were a lot of laymen present and I do not believe that we can entirely ignore the commonsense or the lay view of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* While one would accept the principle of inequity in the representation of the small States as part of the price of the Federation contract and honour the contract which has been entered into, I see no reason why, when there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> need for us to do so, we should import this principle of tremendous inequity into the Senate.

* This is not the responsible path of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration but the irresponsible and dictatorial method of duress. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0)

* This House has not been able to operate according to its prescribed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and democratic functions as a forum of legislative review. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0)

* They challenge the spirit of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of powers and call into question the efficacy of a framework which serves merely to limit the tendencies which have been developed and which demonstrably cannot check them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10)

* But the flagrant determination of the present Labor Government to exploit the weaknesses in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework in order to maximise the dominance of the central government clearly calls for a reappraisal of CommonwealthState financial arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10)

* It is to be hoped that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention will provide a satisfactory response to the existing difficulties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10)

* Consequently, any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration which sought to diminish the efficacy of the Commonwealth's economic management would also be unacceptable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10)

* The financial and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position which has developed in Australia is one of imbalance between the Commonwealth and the States in the allocation of revenue and responsibility.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10)

* However, the present financial relations are deficient in that the States' <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and electoral responsibilities are not matched by financial independence and authority.

* It is now 15 years since the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, which included, as you will recall,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  representatives from all parties, recommended unanimously that the Parliament should seek power by referendum to deal with restrictive trade practices including resale price maintenance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0)

* The Industrial Court upheld their defence - their view - and the Commonwealth, to test the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis of the legislation, took the decision of the Industrial Court to the High Court.

* Of course, the upshot of it was if the corporalion power were to be reinstated the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> premise for the old Restrictive Trade Practices Act was such that the Act was completely and totally invalid except for the section dealing with resale price maintenance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0)

* The other is a special provision for senators whose terms, as to half, commenced on 1 July 1971 and as to the other half will commence on 1 July 1974, each of whom would in accordance with the existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions have a 6-year term.

* In normal circumstances, there will be elections for the House of Representatives in 1975, 1978 and 1981. lt is proposed under the transitional arrangement that a currently sitting senator, whose term began in 1971 and would in accordance with present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision expire in 1977, will continue in office until the second House of Representatives election after the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration comes into force, that is, until 1978 unless there is a double dissolution or early election for the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-41-0)

* This will mean, in normal circumstances and, of course, excluding any senators elected to fill casual vacancies, that the senators serving when the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration becomes law could have a term of up to about  7i  years.

* At the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in September this year in Sydney, I said on behalf of the Australian Government that we would propose to the Parliament, for decision by the people, an amendment of the Constitution which would write into it the principle of substantial equality of electoral divisions for all the Parliaments of Australia.

* Honourable members will recall that at the recent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention I said perhaps the most important amendment that could be achieved for 1973 and beyond would be an amendment to do just this - make it possible for the Australian Government te borrow directly on behalf of local government bodies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-1)

* Firstly, we promised at the 1973 <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention that direct representation of local government would be a condition of the Australian Government's participation.

* The proposals for these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reforms can be traced back virtually to the turn of the century. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0)

* All the Government seeks to do is to give the people of Australia at a referendum the opportunity to consider 3 propositions that have been put forward and argued about by writers on political science and by writers on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform virtually ever since this nation came into being. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0)

* The matter has been stirred up from time to time and was put forward and discussed as recently as a month ago in Sydney at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0)

* So I will not take up any further time in this debate except to put on record my utter disgust with the fact that these 3 important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills will be considered in a matter of about 10 hours debate all finished in this House by 10 p.m. tomorrow night. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0)

* We are declaring these measures urgent Bills because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position and the need to have them passed by the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0)

* A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum is not needed to ensure simultaneous elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* There was another curious litle part of the Prime Minister's speech in which he said that another reason for the legislation is that it takes up the unanimous recommendation, dating as far back as 1958, of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* Further, the growing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the right of Heads of Government to secure a dissolution of the popular House upon request, in my opinion, makes it imperative that the Prime Minister should not have the power to treat the States' House as an appendage of the Popular  House  and take one-half of the Senate to election at the will of the Executive Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* This proposal - that which is called the simultaneous elections proposal - should be rejected on 2 grounds: firstly, because it is unnecessary; and secondly, because its adoption would be dangerous in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and democratic terms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* This <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment process is unnecessary because the power is in the hands of the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* The probability is that in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms that opportunity has now slipped from his grasp. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* The 1959 report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review noted that the existence of fixed senatorial terms had increased the number of elections and that the number of occasions on which there would have been separate elections for senators and members of the House of Representatives would have been greater unless the House of Representatives had been dissolved before the expiration of its full term. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* In one case, the Senators whose terms began in July 1971 will continue in office until the second House of Representatives elections after the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration comes into force; that is, 19.8, unless there is a double dissolution or an early House of Representatives election.

* The subject matter of this Bill was dealt with in the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, and I think that I ought to read into the record the names of the personnel who comprised that Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* As far as the passage of this legislation through this Parliament is concerned, I regard it as completely deplorable that the Government has so ignored the significance of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change that it is prepared to introduce the guillotine in order to hasten the passage of each one of these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* If the honourable member for Diamond Valley had cared I would have been only too prepared to have allowed him to have incorporated in Hansard not only those significant passages from the 1958 report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee but also the reservations that were expressed by  Senator Wright.

* Having heard the remarks of the 3 speakers from the Opposition side in this debate, and having attended the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney, I am convinced that all that honourable members opposite can present to the House is a whole series of cliches. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* The major ground, apart from the fact that what was proposed was Labor Party policy and had been uttered at that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention so that plenty of notice was given of our intention, was that the legislation seeks to carry out a unanimous recommendation made in 1959 by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* I suggest that the 1959 <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee recommended what is in fact logical, that is, that the Australian Constitution should be altered to achieve the end which this Bill seeks. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Commonwealth Bill, as it was In the year 1891, limited the duration of the House of Representatives to three years, but the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Committee, for some reason, have decided to extend that term to four years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* May I suggest to the honourable gentleman that that is precisely the reason, the essence and the kernel of the need for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* On page 12 in section 4, in relation to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters, it says that Labor's way is to abolish the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* There are precedents in May and other places, I understand, for legal rulings of that character, especially on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-36)

* In the first place honourable members opposite are saying that unless somebody from the Opposition calls for a division on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment the vote cannot be counted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-36)

* No division being called for and there being no dissentient voice,  Mr Speaker  drew attention to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that the Bill must be passed by an absolute majority and directed the bells to be rung.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-36)

* Having completely demolished the spurious and delaying arguments of honourable members opposite, I mention before I conclude that these are the gentlemen who said that they had no time to discuss the measure; these are the time wasters who refused to debate great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues, who tried to embarrass  Mr Speaker,  who were educated at all the A grade schools in the country and who are behaving in the national Parliament like second class larrikins.

* Because I believe in what I do and because I heard what I heard, in my opinion it must be accepted by this House that there is a real doubt as to whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions have been satisfied for this question to be put to the people.

* On a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue earlier today the Opposition demanded more time for debate, for time to be made available right up till Christmas, but by acting in a completely unparliamentary way it showed it was not willing to debate this issue in the Parliament now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0)

* Those incidents have meant that there will be about an hour and three-quarters less debating time on the second <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bill under guillotine than there would otherwise have been, lt might be well to recall that the whole fracas arose from the deliberate attitude of the members of the Liberal Party.

* But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original six States, means in the elegant words of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee that 'for every State in which there is an adverse vote there must be a favourable vote in two States ... a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States.'

* That is the question of whether or not the Commonwealth has legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to introduce such referendum legislation which touch and concern powers and functions that are clearly within and remain within the jurisdiction of the States, and are related almost exclusively to electoral matters involving the States.

* I accept that this is the way in which our committees are constructed, but on such an issue as this I think the fact that there is a Government majority will not matter because the issue, I believe, is so important that all members of the Committee will approach this inquiry and investigation as members of a Parliament sworn to uphold the Parliament and knowing the importance of the Parliament to our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedures in Australia.

* The Minister has suggested in all seriousness that the growing of trees would aid in bringing about fundamental changes in these areas, and I would agree that if the Department of Urban and Regional Development had the resources and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> competence this would bring it about.

* The effect of such a proposed change would be that instead of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that, before a referendum can be successful a majority of the electors in a majority of the States must vote in favour of the proposal - that is, that there must be a majority of electors in four out of the six States and also a majority of all electors - in its place there would be a requirement that there must be a majority of electors in only 3 States out of six and a majority of all electors before the proposed law can be presented to the Governor-General for assent.

* In 1900 the great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities of the day Quick and Garran - I hope the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  will see that my legal knowledge is improving - had this to say at page 993 of their book entitled 'Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth': [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* The restriction of the right to vote in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums to the citizens of the States is a consequence of the desire of the framers of our Constitution to protect the small States.

* One may indulge in the luxury of seeking to agree with him in some respects, but what puzzles me on this occasion about the Government which the honourable gentleman leads is the impatience, having regard to the fact that a Constitution Convention was held in Sydney a short time ago and that at that Convention, with the agreement of all of the States and with the agreement of the Commonwealth delegation, of which the Prime Minister was the distinguished leader, committees were set up to investigate various areas of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I would suggest that not only would it have been wise in terms of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform but also wise in terms of political procedure to have awaited the outcome of that committee's report, and shall tell the House why. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* But the simple fact remains that the difficulties about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform are substantial and one can achieve them only step by step, by a process of enlightenment and, I suggest, by a process of encouragement to ensure that those who serve in State parliaments are not consumed or overwhelmed with any sense of fear, that they are convinced as to the merits of the proposal that is put before them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* However, it is the third proposal that concerns me, and I suggest that what the Government has done now is to imperil the prospect of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform by seeking to thrust this proposal onto the States in particular and the people in general. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* Amongst the things which were brought out at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and referred to the executive and the standing committees to be looked at, there are some things which will be plucked out and dealt with by the Australian Government before the ordinary machinery of the Constitution deals with them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* So that we may get the full value out of the work of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, his matter of getting our vote recorded somehow in referenda is of prime importance and should be looked at as a matter of urgency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I find it somewhat odd, in view of the fact that this provision in the constitution is to come under very careful scrutiny by the standing committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, that the honourable member proposes that we should ask the Commonwealth Parliament to put before the people a referendum in advance of the decision of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> committee.

* Undoubtedly the collective wisdom which will be brought together in the executive of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention should arrive at a better and more balanced decision and one which will carry more force in an Australian referendum on the subject than a decision of one parliament or one man, the Prime Minister or the Federal Parliament.

* I was interested in what was said at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and in the reference 'by the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner)  to  Sir John  Cockburn, a famous South Australian. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* In my view, the question of the procedures for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment is the most fundamental issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I have said this previously, and I will repeat it: It is paradoxical to find that Switzerland, the country whose procedures most resemble Australia's - that is, an amendment passed by Parliament, by a majority of votes, in a majority of cantons and a majority overall - has had, in contrast to Australia, the greatest number of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I can only reiterate the argument I advanced at the recent <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* This stems undoubtedly from the recommendations of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1958 and 1959. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* To their credit they came up with a pretty good Constitution for their time, but surely they would have been the last people to argue that the result of their combined labours was to fix a codification of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law which was to remain inflexible, immutable and binding upon all generations for all time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* But I am less convinced that all Australians would seek to alter the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement in relation to a majority of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* Not only would this in my mind be a more reasonable way, a more honest way, a more direct way and a more clear cut way of presenting the alternative propositions to the Australian people but also it would probably have the very real effect of giving the Australian people the opportunity of voting in favour of the measure proposing a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change to give electors in the Territories the opportunity to vote at a referendum and also to express their opinion on the second proposal contained in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* It is a very odd thing that in 1973 the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> safeguards of the federal system should take on a new significance, but they do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* It was of concern to me that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  should introduce into this Parliament a number of significant Bills to initiate referendums to change the Constitution at a time when local government authorities, State governments and the Federal Government are meeting together in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* Irrespective of the merits of each one of the Bills that have been submitted to us, it is important that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review convention be allowed and be seen to perform the charge which has been given to it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I mentioned before my belief that if this Bill were to come forward it would have been better had it emanated or evolved from the discussions at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* But that does not mean that, when a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review convention is meeting and when the States are the principal participants in that convention, they should not have been given the first opportunity to say whether they really believed that this sort of change was in their interests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I query the degree to which in this particular area there is a need for us specifically to change the Constitution to make <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change easier simply by the removal of the requirement that a majority of States should support the referendum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* The other thing that concerns me is the degree to which at this stage people within the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are denied the opportunity to speak on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I believe that it reflects little credit on him and his Government that he has not been prepared to participate within that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in a meaningful way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* This Bill, perhaps more than any of the others, demonstrates that the Prime Minister is not particularly concerned with the Convention; nor, indeed, would I suggest that he is really concerned with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, other than the extent to which it is going to enhance the powers which he and his colleagues will exercise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I believe that the Australian people need to take note of the degree to which that is the significant motivation which leads the Government to present this Bill to the House at this time, rather than any genuine concern about making <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change simpler and easier. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I have no doubt that they will have a long period of time in which to learn what it is like because the citizens of Australia will become aware of the pettifoggery honourable members opposite have introduced into one of the most considerable areas of Australian activity, that is, Australia's own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> exercises. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* It is one of the miracles of Australian public life, considering the fact that there are still people like that here, that 80 years ago we were able to have <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions and to enhance the tremendous document that is the government arrangements of Australia, as a result of the vote of the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* It may seem to be only a drafting amendment but it has a little bit of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> force behind it and I think the Government might seriously consider it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* In other words, if honourable members read Quick and Garran and understand the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles and the realities of a federal and democratic system that guided the fathers of the Constitution, they must come to the conclusion that before a referendum is put to the Australian people they must be informed of exactly what is involved in the proposed change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* Secondly, as I think my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  would point out, the representatives of the people in the Northern Territory, and particularly the representatives of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory, believe/ that this matter should be discussed by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I do not understand that anybody at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention - certainly not the representatives from the 2 Territories - had proposed that the people in the 2 Territories should be denied a vote in referendums any longer than was necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* None of them at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention demurred at the proposition that a referendum to give the people in the Territories a vote in subsequent referendums should be held at the earliest possible moment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* This proposal has not been rejected by our 2 predecessors, and it has been adopted by my Government The right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  said in rather a high flown passage that high opinions of best <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> view is that the position should remain as it is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* In 1958 and 1959 his fellow Ministers and my colleagues on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee recommended this change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I remind honourable gentlemen that the purpose of the Bill in this respect is to carry out recommendations made 15 years ago by three out of the four Liberal members, both Country Party members and all the Australian Labor Party members of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Government in fact has no appreciation whatever of the importance of the State governments, of their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and of their rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0)

* The assumption by the Commonwealth of financial responsibility for tertiary education raises obvious and very real problems in relation to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the States.

* I ask him further to indicate whether he is prepared to go on record as saying that in the field of education this Government is prepared to recognise that the various State Governments have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority and that that authority must be protected.

* Finally I ask him, as I asked him last week, whether he will outline in some detail before 8 December in what areas and to what degree the proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers will be exercised and what supplementary measures will be adopted if those referendum proposals are carried.

* I urge the Minister to look at the question of the provision of adequate compensation as if the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement were there for the provision of just terms and a recognition of the importance of providing an increase in value to take account of the declining value of money notwithstanding an earlier decision of the High Court taken under different conditions and at a different time.

* Of course, something must be done about prices, but it is curious that, every time a Labor Government is in power in Canberra, it finds that its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers are insufficient for it to handle the economy.

* Having regard to the promise of the Minister for Minerals and Energy to table in this House those opinions establishing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Pipeline Authority Act and having regard to the enormous national significance of the measures introduced by the Minister last night, is the Minister prepared to fulfil his promise to me, if possible before the House rises for the Christmas recess?

* For the reasons which the Committee gave in its reports of 1958 and 1959, the Government persists with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment which the Committee proposed all those years ago and which this chamber carried a fortnight ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* Rightly, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has confined his remarks to one clause of the Bill, clause 2 (c), which proposes that section 128 of the Australian Constitution should be altered in order to make it easier for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change to be brought about in the manner set out in proposed new section 128 of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* I have no doubt whatsover that if honourable members read the Constitution - particularly if they read the various debates that took place prior to the Constitution being accepted and, much more importantly, if they read Quick and Garran, the recognised authority on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters - they will find that there are various reasons why we should insist on the principle of a majority of people in a majority of States supporting a referendum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* Still,  Mr Withnall,  a leading lawyer in the Northern Territory, found it somewhat odd, in view of the fact that this provision in the Constitution is to come under very careful scrutiny by the Standing Committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, that we should be asking the Commonwealth Parliament to put before the people a referendum in advance of the decision of that Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* Undoubtedly the collective wisdom which will be brought together in the executive of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention should arrive at a better and more balanced decision and one which will carry more force in an Australian referendum on the subject than a decision of one Parliament or one man (the Prime Minister) or the Federal Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* This is one of the reasons why I pointed out to the House that when there is a proposal for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change we must be certain, first of all, that the federal relationship is being maintained - unless the people who, after all, are the sovereign people of this country agree to a change - and, secondly, that the people have adequate time in which to bring their thinking to bear on the proposal.

* Perhaps I can conclude with this thought: This is one case where the Senate cannot prevent the people expressing their voice because if, after another 3 months, we put this Bill and the attendant <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration Bills through the House and the Senate again rejects them, shelves them or unacceptably amends them, then without any limitation of time the Bill can be put to the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* As I understand the application of standing order 250 and the procedure which the Prime Minister is adopting, the Prime Minister is seeking to pre-empt any opportunity of parliamentary debate on an important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter on which the Government wishes the Australian people to vote at a Commonwealth referendum.

* I was interested to hear the Prime Minister relating chapter and verse the amount of correspondence and so on that he has had with the various State governments, the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, the Parliamentary Counsel and Attorneys-General. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-25)

* So it is of importance that this Parliament be given time to consider a Bill of major <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proportions which can fundamentally change the structure of government in Australia by altering the balance of distribution of powers between the States and the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-25)

* When it can be seen that the traffic can operate in any sensible way only in one direction, it is obvious that the motive and the purpose of the Prime Minister in introducing this matter before the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last year was to provide a vehicle for State Labor governments to transfer powers to the Commonwealth and so, as I said in referring to another matter before this House, to fulfil the ambition of the present Government and to enable the Prime Minister himself to aggrandise the power of the Commonwealth at the expense of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-25)

* To try to exculpate the errors and ways of the Government and the Prime Minister by referring to correspondence with the State governments and by referring to the consideration of this Bill by a committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in no way relieves this Parliament of its obligation and its duty to consider fully and amply the implications of this Bill.

* On 20 November a letter was received from  Mr Punch,  the Minister for Works in New South Wales and  chairman  of Committee B of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, asking for copies of the Bill for consideration by the Committee as soon as possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* All the reasons for not referring matters which have been put forward in the past such as suggestions referring to the weakness of the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system and the fact that the States are concerned about referring powers to the Commonwealth because they might not be able to get them back or to attach conditions to them, precedent or subsequent, surely are nonsense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* Let us set up a system whereby people from the States and from the Australian Government can sit down together and negotiate the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes that are so badly needed'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* The 3 arguments of the Minister for Secondary Industry were: Firstly, that as a result of consultation with the States, this fifth of the guillotined <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment Bills has been presented to this Parliament for urgent passage so that the Australian people can take a vote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* This particular consultation with the States, of course, was set out in a recitation of events beginning with the arbitrary dictate by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitiam)  at the opening of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of a range of matters which he said were going to be presented to the Australian people by way of referenda, irrespective of the Convention and the deliberations that were going to take place and irrespective of the concern of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Minister's second argument was that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention supported the presentation of this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* It is true that the Convention supported the general concept that there should be a reference of powers and a change to this part of section 51 of the Constitution as to the way by which there could be a reference of powers but I would query quite seriously whether the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, either at its opening session or in any other way, has given support to the measure before this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention expressed general support for the introduction of a measure to permit the interchange of powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* I believe it has no chance of passage when the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, either through the committee which was charged with the responsibility of inquiring into its terms or through the executive which was charged with the passage of procedures of the Convention from time to time until the next plenary session, has not given its support to it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* I think the very fact that it is hastening its passage through this Parliament and the fact that it is not prepared to listen to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention or to the arguments of those committee members who have been examining the measure in detail or to consider the measures that have been advanced by the States indicate that the Government is not really concerned with the passage of the Bill but rather is concerned to get a package that it can present at a Senate election - a package which, I submit, is designed to confuse the electorate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* The first is a letter by the Honourable Leon Punch,  Chairman  of Standing Committee B of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* They believe that this could best be achieved by having the proposal first considered at a full meeting of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* There is no doubt that the States through the expression of the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and through the expression of their own concern at the urgent passage of this legislation are now casting reservations on the measure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* What this House must do, and I hope what the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention will do, is determine where the political responsibilities should lie and what <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers should be allocated to deal with these responsibilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* Apparently it is proposed that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration proposed in this legislation should be put with 4 other referenda at the Senate election which presumably will be held in May. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* He knows that this matter was considered at a meeting of Standing Committee B of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney two or three weeks ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0)

* Having said that and, I believe, responding in a responsible fashion to what the Leader of the House has just said - we seek to claim no political credit for the malfunction which has taken place - I want to go on record as saying that, despite the precedent to which the honourable gentleman referred, this situation is really a little different because it concerns 4 major <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills which the Government has put before this Parliament as Bills of fundamental importance which it intends to take to a Senate election. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0)

* I have no doubt that when the people of this country are required, as they may well be, to cast a vote on these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments they will take note of the manner in which the Government has forced the legislation through the House, or sought to do so, but was so unable to direct the proceedings of the House that it could not front up to a debate at the required time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0)

* To see the greatest nation on earth caught in the throes of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and leadership crises is tragic, and it can happen here as easily as it has happened there because the reason for Watergate, the reason for the whole American turmoil, is the unbridled chase for power.

* I believe analysis shows, even if it should be that this BUI proves to be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>- that is a matter for the courts to decide, not for anyone to say what he thinks will happen- that it gives practically uncontrolled power to the proposed Authority and to the Minister and the Government and provides for practically no parliamentary oversight.

* It may be that the Minister has a reason for taking out the words; it may be that he could not press this amendment to the Act, but I do suggest to him that because of the history of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation of the industrial power those words are tremendously important and to omit them could lead to the invalidity of section 136 and therefore of a very significant section.

* What the Federal organisation which is trying to withstand the takeover bid by another Federal organisation does is to use its State union as the vehicle for preventing a takeover, the reason being that the State union already has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> coverage through its membership rules or award coverage by an award issued out of the State jurisdiction.

* In my view, and I believe in the view of the great majority of the Australian people, there is no better way of doing that than by having a system with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarch as the head of state, as we presently have.

* The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem must be solved first either by obtaining co-operation from the States, something which this Government seems to be incapable of doing, or by having the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question determined before the scheme comes into operation and before the insurance industry is dismantled as was done by the arrangement over the Marriage Act in the early 1960s.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0)

* I assume that the honourable member for Wentworth, who was at one time Solicitor-General, is correct in his assumption that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem can be referred to the High Court of Australia before the provisions of the Bill are implemented and somebody is forced to take action.

* It has been pointed out in this place that there is some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt as to the validity of this Bill and that if the High Court decides that the Bill does not abolish common law rights and clauses 92 and so on of the Bill are therefore invalid, very grave consequences will occur to the Australian economy.

* So, there is a very important role for this Department to play, namely, to act on behalf of the Australian Government, quite unapologetically and using all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers which the Australian Government has in relation to imports and so on, to make sure that no projects are allowed to go ahead, no matter who is backing them and no matter whose money is involved, unless proper precautions have been taken.

* Although not openly recognising factors like these, even in the area of private law, as with Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law before the abolition of Federal appeals, the Privy Council has begun to show signs of deferring to decisions of the High Court.

* The prediction by the then Governor-General,  Sir Paul  Hasluck, that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention might result in a monumental flop regrettably and tragically has come to pass as the product of this Labor Government being prepared to assert its interpretation of what should be the changes in the Constitution without reference to the Australian people and without their consent.

* I suggest that it does violence to our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history and to our understanding of the circumstances which produced the Statute of Westminster and, most importantly of aU, it does violence to the very thing that the Government has so often tried to assert since it came to government- to try to alter the Australian Constitution by any method other than that described in that document.

* Yet we have the Constitution of Australia, which again he is so fond of using as authority for his stand on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposition that he so often propounds before this Parliament, giving to this Parliament supremacy in respect of appeals to the Privy Council from the High Court; but it deliberately does not give that same supremacy in respect of appeals to the Privy Council from the State Supreme Courts.

* Legality is the source of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority, and whilst the Government can find a source of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for the Bill that we are now debating it is on dubious ground indeed to find a source of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority in seeking to abolish appeals from State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council.

* I also enter this debate because I feel that, having regard to what has been written in the Press, what has been said privately and what has been said in another place, much has been left to be desired with regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> perspective with which this whole question must be approached.

* It is not simply the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, because that does not pay due regard to the principle; but the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement is that the GovernorGeneral, being the delegate of the Queen, Will act on the advice of the executive government of the country.

* Whatever I think of that is a private opinion; whatever any member of this House or the other place thinks about that appointment is a private opinion; and so I say nothing about that private opinion because I do not think it is appropriate to the vital <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question which we must aU ask ourselves.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* The important aspect about this provision is that, by the Constitution of Australia, the will of the people, if we wish to put it in those terms, is expressed in this vacuum of a casual vacancy by the Houses of the Parliament of the State constituted by the individuals elected to those Houses by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes of that State, and those Houses of the Parliament then have entrusted to them in aU the acts that they perform the expression of the Will of the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> assumption is that in the decision of those Houses the will of the people is expressed and thereby the trust of the people is put into effect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* The next <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process is that that decision imposed upon the Houses of the Parliament in trust for the people of the State must be put before a general election of members of the House of Representatives or at the next election of senators for the State.

* Firstly, the people at the next election at which that person must be put forward can accept or reject the person chosen by the Houses of the Parliament of the State and, further than that, the people may, at the next election of the members of Parliament of that State, cast their opinion as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety or, if we Uke to put it in rather baser terms the political propriety of what the Houses of the Parliament of that State did.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* How much more necessary is it then for members of the High Court who have previously been members of a government which has been instrumental in the passing of a law to be so very careful in the stand that they take in the High Court when they are called upon to judge the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of that law.

* Let him not speak in terms of violence to democracy when he does not present in proper context his own arguments in justification of his own action because, as I have said, in appointing the then  Senator Murphy  to the High Court the Prime Minister undoubtedly took every political advantage at his command, acting as he did with strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety.

* The Australian Government takes the view that it wants to go to the limit of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power because it has to change the absurd situation whereby an appellant in a State system of courts- in the New South Wales Supreme Court or the Victorian Supreme Court or the South Australian Supreme Court or the Western Australian Supreme Court or the Tasmanian Supreme Court or the Queensland Supreme Court- can bypass the High Court and go to the Privy Council, thus setting up 2 different competing lines of authority.

* If the experience of the past 75 years is any guide at all, the continuing change in our social, economic and political life can make a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision, previously thought to be inviolable, not only obsolete but also detrimental to the workings of good government.

* A very great risk to our society, arising out of the inability of the Constitution to move with the times, is that the nature of change and the speed of change may be such that all governments in our system may lose control of evolving situations unless our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> mechanisms have the adaptability and flexibility to meet them.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Under the terms of this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal it will be put separately again and for that I think criticism can be levelled at the Government and perhaps the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  directly, but there is no point in engaging in that sort of criticism. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It can be altered  de facto  by decisions of the High Court on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* But it is not proper that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in Australia should  de facto  rely upon judicial interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* So when the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention met in Sydney one of the first items that was listed was this very question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in 1973 shows that the list of topics for discussion included as the very first item: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The proposal was put to the meeting of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* After the dinner it was announced that there was agreement in principle to such a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to enable the transfer of powers both from the States to the Commonwealth and vice versa from the Commonwealth to the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* In the 2 years since there has been a great deal of consideration of the matter by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention Committees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Proposed new section 108a (1) is quite clear as to what it means on its wording, but 108a (2) would present a great deal of problems to some people who are concerned that the Constitution is not changed from its basic federal concept to render it a more centralist <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> document. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I think that if it is passed it will make a giant contribution to the future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I will not cover that ground again but I shall refer to one matter which is of considerable interest to me, and that is the question of road safety and the interchange of powers between the States and the Commonwealth in this matter.- The first report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety, of which I was a member, made a recommendation to the Parliament that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position so far as road safety is concerned ought to be carefully examined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* These <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems would, I believe, be largely overcome if this referendum is carried and the States can refer powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* An important matter- this has been discussed before both at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and here- is whether the powers should be able to be revoked by either the Commonwealth or the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I think that I should read the letters which were presented at the first <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney in September 1973. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It is considered that, by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, these uncertainties should be removed by providing, for example, that references of legislative power by States to the Commonwealth may be made for limited terms and that repeal of a reference act has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> efficacy, and also that the Commonwealth Parliament might refer to the States any legislative power of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Before concluding I would like to say something about the role of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in pushing forward with these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reforms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I think <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform is long overdue and the Prime Minister will be remembered in time to come for it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It is a matter of record and a matter of fact that in many other countries which require constitutions to be changed the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments have been carried much more frequently than they have here. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It can be said that some of the points that he made emphasise one of the difficulties and one of the problems of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referenda. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* That is why, as already mentioned on 2 occasions by the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)  and the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie),  there is a difficulty in having <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations passed and in fact in having any referenda passed by the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I mentioned earlier that one of the problems confronting the acceptance of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations is the fear in the States, and sometimes even within the Federal sphere, of greater powers in one area reducing the powers and the capacity in another. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I refer to the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which was presented in 1958. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I would make only one comment following what was said by the honourable member for Hawker which shows possibly one of the problems and difficulties confronting <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The Labor members of the Committee considered that full legislative powers should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament with the duty and authority to create States possessing delegated <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* So, it is for that reason that, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Bennelong, we in the Opposition support the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposals involved in the change which the legislation presented by the Prime Minister seeks to achieve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* But if a political power is fragmented in some form or another, in some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or federal system, a confederate system or in some other system, so that political power is watered down to such an extent that we will find a concentration of that power of a different kind in a different area- say, the private sector- we will get for example enormous economic power, corporate power, which is not accountable to anyone. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* On the other hand, we of the Australian Parliament have no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to make a law on the subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I conclude with these final words: I am not sure whether the germ of this idea of a mutual exchange of powers can be traced back to the 1957 Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review of this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I know that the Prime Minister has been very much attached to the idea of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change for a great period of time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The initiative in bringing this measure forward is largely a tribute to the Prime Minister's persistent interest in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change and a recognition that this frozen, rigid Constitution of ours must somehow in 1975, and in 1985 and in 1995, be made capable of adapting itself to the changing world that it is intended to serve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* A few moments ago the AttorneyGeneral was extolling, in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> context, the virtues of flexibility and of having an open mind on change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* We do not believe that the problems of providing an effective legal aid service will be solved simply by leaving the matter to the States- not because we believe that the attempts made by the States over the years have not contained a great deal of merit and have not contributed a great deal to the provision of legal aid services, but the fact is that the Commonwealth has a direct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal responsibility in a number of areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* Firstly- I invite honourable gentlemen opposite to examine this- there must be serious doubts as to the constitutionality of the functions conferred by the Bill on the Australian Legal Aid Office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* Certainly the incidental power under the Constitution would be some help in providing a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis base for the provisions of clause 6 of the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* Those words in themselves acknowledge the tenuous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base on which this Bill rests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* For this purpose the Opposition believes that a joint committee of both Houses should consider the important legal, social and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues involved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* Within that legal aid commission, which could be an independent commission supported by and set up under State statute and supported by State and Federal money, offices could be set up in which members of the public- our constituents as well as State constituents- could get the legal aid they want without any reference to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Australian Government, therefore, from the outset, made clear its position that the location of the border should be determined by negotiation between the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments, with the Australian Government accepting the responsibility to take account of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and other interests of the Government of the State of Queensland and particularly to protect the interests of Torres Strait Islanders.

* By following a course of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> anarchy he has jeopardised relations not just between a Labor Government and a Country Party-Liberal Party Government in Queensland, but between 2 countries, Papua New Guinea and Australia.

* The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election, and upon his continued authority in the popularly elected House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections.

* It would, in my respectful opinion (and in this I am expressing the majority view among reputable lawyers in this State), have been nothing short of a calamity if during the very great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis, New South Wales had possessed a Governor who had subordinated the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority of a Governor to the purely opportunist demands of those who found the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> restrictions irksome.

* The years 1975 or 1976 could see the first time in the 75 years during which Australia has had a national Parliament, the first of the 25 occasions on which a Governor-General has put such requests to the State Governors, that a Premier advises a Governor to disregard <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, to fail in the duty which the Constitution imposes on a Governor.

* However, because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations of this Parliament, clause 6 of the Bill must limit the granting of legal aid by the Australian Legal Aid Office to matters which come within the lawmaking powers of the Commonwealth or to matters incidental to those powers.

* These 4 questions emerged not just as a product of a decision by this Government, not because two of them have been before the people before, but because the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention on three successive occasions led towards an acceptance of these 4 resolutions, which was achieved finally at the Wrest Point convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* In that sense there needs to be a recognition by those who might question these referenda that throughout the country there seems to be a universal accord that this type of deliberation on the Constitution is worth while; that if there is to be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change it should not be just for the fulfilment of the political aspirations, desires or objectives of the Government for the time being in Canberra but it should be something that has evolved from the consultation at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions.

* The second question which I think is equally likely to be accepted without criticism, although I know that there were some people at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart who offered some views upon it, is the question of altering the Constitution so as to allow electors in Territories as well as electors in the States to vote at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution.

* I believe it is necessary when filling casual vacancies that we recognise that there will be a prescribed procedure which will enable the State governments to determine the manner by which they will select persons to fill casual vacancies, and which will ensure that the rights of the States are preserved, as it shall be certified by the Governor of the State and not by the GovernorGeneral, and that Governor of the State will then be able to submit the name and the person will be appointed in accordance with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement which I believe will validly set out a fit and proper procedure.

* <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> change is not something on which we should embark lightly, but when it has been ratified by successive Conventions and there has been an almost unanimous acceptance of those resolutions it is necessary that the Australian people have the chance to vote and endorse that decision.
