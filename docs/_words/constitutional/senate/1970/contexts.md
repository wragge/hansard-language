* My question which is directed to the Attorney-General refers to reported statements yesterday oy the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth probably has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate on pollution, although he doubted whether anyone would challenge the appropriation of funds for antipollution measures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0)

* I present the report from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the Death Penalty Abolition Bill i970. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-33)

* The practice has been that Attorneys-General have not been prepared to answer questions on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law following court decisions, but this is a matter for the AttorneyGeneral.

* Thus, in light of its consideration of the decision in the firefighters' case and the particular result that has flowed from that decision in the Australian Capital Territory, the Government sees no reason why the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be restricted in the Territories to dealing with industrial disputes involving only persons who are engaged in an industry in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense of that word. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-41-0)

* Because this work was agreed to by the sovereign State of Tasmania in 1967 and is its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility and because the work has been practically completed - to the extent that the resultant enlargement is approximately three-quarters full - is it not ludicrous, purposeless and asinine to conduct an inquiry now into the proposition, which actually is of little concern to the Commonwealth?

* Is the Attorney-General aware that on 22nd February 1973 the then Acting Prime Minister stated that the Commonwealth Government had decided not to seek leave to intervene in the High Court case involving the question of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Tasmanian tobacco tax.

* I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the Government, by seeking the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to deal with prices, thereby intends by the use of the single word 'prices' also to secure a power over interest, rents and wages? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0)

* 
 Senator MURPHY (New South WalesAttorneyGeneral) I ask for leave to give contingent notice for tomorrow as follows: That contingent on the receipt of a further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration bill I shall move that standing order 242 be suspended to enable the third reading to be passed without a call of the Senate.

* I am sorry that, as happened in 1969, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal difficulties are being raised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0)

* An alteration to the Constitution is necessary before the Government can implement its plan, and the people are being asked at a referendum whether they believe that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration should be made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63)

* I think that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter is involved and I should order a division. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0)

*  The Opposition will oppose this motion and it will oppose it for the reasons which have been advanced on earlier occasions when these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills have come before the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46)

* It makes it so awkward because I was going to mention the fact that this matter was supposed to go before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46)

* I understand that whenever Bills for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations have been before the Senate on earlier occasions that practice has been adopted instead of the practice of seeking to remove altogether the obligation for a call of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-48)

* The Leader of the Government will still have an opportunity, if a second reading should be given to this or any of the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills, to move either that standing order 242 be suspended or, if he feels that the attitude of the Senate on that is quite clear, that standing order 283 be amended in some way so that the obligation of a 3-week delay is reduced to, say, 24 hours or less. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-48)

* That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0)

* This Bill is not in the same position as the other 4 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0)

* It received very intense consideration by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee from 1956 to 1959 when I endeavoured to have established what I think would be the system advocated by  Mr Justice  Dixon- that is to say, the unitary system, ignoring the division between State and Federal jurisdictions, and having one system of judges to administer the law whether it be State or Federal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

* However, that can be achieved only by a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, and until that amendment is made it is vastly preferable to retain the system operating to date whereby Federal jurisdiction in important fields has been vested in the State supreme courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

 -Mr President, I bring up the report of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory reporting that the Committee has been unable to complete its inquiry into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Northern Territory, and move: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-63)

* I have no wish to become involved in an argument on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation, except to say that it has been my experience that mostly when an amendment is to be rejected the excuse that is usually used as a last resort is that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem that cannot be overcome. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0)

* Of course, there is also the point that specific reference to anything, including housing, in the objectives of the legislation could be used as grounds for challenging its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0)

* I inform the Senate that I have received a message from the House of Representatives relating to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-59)

* It is, accordingly, an occasion of great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance in the history of this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#debate-2)

* -It concerns the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-0)

* And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review elected democratically by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights, but is the States' House by which all Australians in their own sovereign states formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources for their mutual benefit and advancement, [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4)

* It may well be that it is within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> competence of the Australian Parliament to take action in respect of some of the matters dealt with in that legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0)

* that Pensioners transport be made free within the Federation where the Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, to make all Government and Private transport free within the Federation to Pensioners and all other underpriviledged members of the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4)

* I suggest that we are discussing the proposition that the Australian Labor Party ought to be given 5 representatives at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and the Liberal-Country Party Opposition ought to be given four, therby giving the Labor party the traditional majority which a government usually has on committees of this type. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0)

* I believe that the Liberal Movement has already a representative at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0)

* I intend to say little in support of my own inclusion in this list of delegates to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0)

* Another member of the Liberal Movement in that State has been appointed by the State Government as a member of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0)

* That the amendment to the bill recommended by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights of women who play the traditional role in society will be protected, as will the interests of the children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-4)

* It will be the task of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to probe this difference of opinion and to determine where the balance of judgment lies so far as the insurance industry is concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34)

* To my understanding, it was accepted in the House of Representatives by the Opposition as a proper basis upon which representation should go from this Parliament to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0)

* If he is suggesting, for example, that the Government should have nominated as the Opposition's representatives at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention himself, the other Independent and perhaps a member of the Australian Country Party and that that would have been reasonable and something which ought to have been acceptable to the Opposition, his thought processes are quite extraordinary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0)

* It lacks the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power to raise loans on behalf of local government and, earlier this year, a referendum to establish that power was unsuccessful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-1)

* That the inclusion in Sub-section 54 (2) of the Family Law Bill of the Clause recommended in paragraph 67 (f) (2) of the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which will allow "any fact or circumstance" to be taken into account when considering maintenance, completely alters the whole concept of specific guidelines as now set out in Section 54, and we oppose it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-0)

* There is criticism if one brings in a Bill and does not accept any changes to it; but there is even more criticism if one listens to some of the suggestions that are made and, as in the case of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which examined the clauses of this Bill, if one endeavours to have drafts made incorporating views which seem to be sensible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* They relate not only to certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems but also to whether or not a Family Court can provide the service and the facilities for persons who are involved in matrimonial causes with adaptations that the existing State system can provide. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* In the United States of America there is not a total exclusion of the conduct of foreign affairs between the  President  and the Congress because there are inside the Congress, and particularly in the Senate of the United States of America, certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprieties which the Senate particularly is charged with observing.

* Accordingly, when the High Court decision in the Hamersley case cast doubts on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the receipts duty legislation of the States in its application to certain types of receipts, the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  indicated last September that the Commonwealth would see that the States did not lose revenue in 1969-70 in the event that this doubt was confirmed.

* It was well recognised by the High Court in 1907 that the Governor of a State carrying out functions such as those which are conferred upon him by section 15 of the Constitution, acts as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of the State and can act on the advice of his Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0)

* The duty therefore is one of the duties which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of the State owes to the State, and in the case of the Governor but in a slightly different sense to the sovereign, its performance must be enforced in the manner appropriate to the case of such duties.

* I sense that unless the State of New South Wales is prepared to exercise a power which it could exercise in 1 of 2 ways it should be a matter for consideration by this Senate as to what course it ought to take to ensure that these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions are observed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0)

* The alternative view is to ensure that the purposes of the Constitution are observed by proroguing a Parliament which is simply achieved by proclamation and a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation, if this be the interpretation which is relied upon, will then operate, lt should be noted that by a curious coincidence of events the current session of the New South Wales Parliament is a session which apparently began in August of last year ami is still continuing.

* We understand that the States requested the Commonwealth to levy this receipts tax because, following the Western Australian case that went to the High Court, it was found that the States did not have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to levy the tax. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18)

* My understanding of that proposition was that it was found that the States did not have sufficient <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to levy a petrol tax, so the Commonwealth took it over and levied it for them.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18)

* If possible and if we are asked, we would be prepared to pass validating legislation to enable the States to continue to do what they have been doing in the way of taxation, if they wish to do it, though we do not know whether that validating legislation itself would in fact be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and would stand up to a challenge.

* Without exaggeration or embellishment it shows on one hand the States faced with the heavy financial obligation to caro' out their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities, carrying the whole burden of the national debt, and going further and further into debt while the Commonwealth not only gets out of the debt, but builds up vast interest earning investments, paying  all  the cost of Government monetary policy of rising interest rates .

* I feel that with the present committees, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> committees we have, and the involvement of senators now in the estimates committees and standing committees, senators who are not involved in official work of the Senate - such as Ministers, leaders of the Opposition Parties and the Whips - will not be moving to take part in the committee work.

* In this process there was one significant parliamentary and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point that was advanced, maintained and sustained, and that was that the House should refer to its appropriate committee a full examination of the problem that apparently arose and caused the Standing Orders Committee of the House to sit and report.

* Partly because the validity of the Trade Practices Tribunal was under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge - a challenge that proved to bc unsucessfu - for three-quarters of the year under review in the Commissioner's third report, there have been no cases argued before the Trade Practices Tribunal so far.

* As the voice of tradition, he strongly attacked the Labor Party's decision to oppose in the Senate legislation which will give the States their $125m in revenue from the receipt duties tax; it was against <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and ALP tradition,  Mr Calwell  told Caucus last week, for an upper house to interfere with a money Bill.

* In those other areas where complementary Commonwealth and State action may be required the Committee has visualised that type of approach rather than probing the limits of the constitution to call upon the Commonwealth to exact legal disciplines, perhaps against the will of the States, which may be subject to challenge under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law.

* In the knowledge that it has received a considerable volume of evidence relating to the legal, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and practical problems raised by the issue of where legislative authority lies in the Australian federation in respect of the off-shore waters and sea-bed adjacent to Australia, the Committee considers that a report on its first term of reference would assist parliamentary and public appreciation of that issue.

* The Committee does not accept that on the opinions and arguments available and canvassed from 1962 to 1964 the case for the Commonwealth being able to assert <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority over the continental shelf was unquestionable; nor was the Commonwealth's case for control over the territorial sea-bed one which it was entitled to assume would be judicially upheld.

* Clause 4, therefore, is an expression introduced by the Draftsman as to the objects of the Act so as to ensure that the courts will not interpret the Act as an attempt to go beyond the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers that this Parliament has, those powers not enabling us in any way to regulate, prohibit or promote the manufacture of wool within Australia, but being limited to trade and commerce in wool among the Slates and overseas.

* On the one hand we have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects of the appointment of Assistant Ministers, and on the other hand we have the practical needs for the appointment of Assistant Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* Both this afternoon and on Tuesday evening  Senator Willesee  referred to what he described as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubts in respect of the appointment of Assistant Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* As far back as 1952 one of the most eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers of the land,  Sir Robert  Menzies, the then Prime Minister, backed by his eminent advisers of those days, said that there was no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bar to the appointment of Assistant Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* The Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  said here on Tuesday that the need for a reference to any body or authority as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety of establishing the office of Assistant Minister was non-existent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* So we have a wealth of eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers who say there is no doubt on this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* So from the point of view of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> correctness I have no doubt about the appointments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* who has advised that in his clear opinion a Parliamentary Under-Secretary does not in law hold an office at all, still less an office of profit under the Crown, and that his appointment is in all respects <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>.. With this opinion I entirely agree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* It has been said that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt about the ability of the Prime Minister to appoint Assistant Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* In my view - and I think in the view of certain members on the Government side - there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt as to whether he can appoint Assistant Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* If the Government appoints Ministers and Assistant Ministers whenever it feels like doing so, without <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority, it will be doing exactly what the editorial in today's newspaper stated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* Speaking on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect of the amendment and as one who was here when Assistant Ministers were appointed quite some years ago - I rely on my memory - I feel that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect was adequately cleared up at that time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0)

* To fill these gaps, and as an interim or holding measure, the Government proposes to introduce legislation to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects that were found to exist in the present Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* This holding legislation will be substantially the same as the existing Trade Practices Act save for the amendments required by a consideration of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects attributed to it by the High Court's judgment and the availability of the corporations power contained in section 51 (xx) of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* For far too long there has been this no-man's land in the law, in relation to which it has been said that however important legislation of an economic and social character might be, or however desirable it is in the public interest, it was not possible for it to be enacted by this Commonwealth Parliament because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* To a very great extent those <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties have now been clarified and it is apparent that there is a great sphere for action by the Commonwealth Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* The judgment has opened up tremendous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> vistas which no doubt will be exploited - certainly explored - in the years that are to come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* This is an historic judgment - because it sets out the principle which is to be followed by courts in opening these new <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> horizons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* The method of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation is the same as that with which we have been long familiar with the common law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* But that is a very different thing from setting out to decide at one blow the full ambit of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* How that will be used is now only a matter of speculation, but I do think that the Senate can come to the conclusion that the judgment opens a new era in Australian consti tutional history, perhaps-in Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relations - between the Commonwealth and the States, and as to the possibilities that now present themselves for the development of this nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* But as we move further from the time of the actual setting down of the Constitution, and as there is a consistent and persistent refusal to re-look at the Constitution by way of referenda or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment of some kind or another, more and more the area of power is moving from this Parliament into judicial tribunals, and it was left to the High Court to make this very big advance for Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* Therefore in my view this highlights the need for the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee to be reactivated and for the recommendations of that Committee to find at least discussion and perhaps acceptance in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0)

* I do not think it is a good thing that such powers should be left to reside in the High Court due to the failure of the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes to operate and give viability to the Constitution.

* The Concrete Pipes case is a landmark in legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history,

* That
            Parliament, in the time I served in it, had not come to terms in any way with the
            reforms that obviously 8 September 1971 are required in a parliament in this day and age
            in order to make it a meaningful institution and to enable it to perform the

* I rise to say a few words on this subject, not so much because I wish to support  Senator Cant  in his application to the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  to have this matter removed into the High Court for a determination of the legal problem that it presents - I agree entirely that it does raise in a very real way some of the grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems that are facing the Federal and State governments in relation to the control of the seabed and all that that entails - but because I believe that this matter raises another problem altogether.

* While an answer to a question without notice is not the occasion on which to express an opinion on legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues, it does appear to me that the honourable senator's suggestion of a lower rate of duty on aviation fuel used on flights to and from Tasmania would constitute discrimination between the States on a law relating to taxation, lt would therefore be beyond the Commonwealth's powers.

* This Bill, as stated by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood)  and as has been adverted to by other honourable senators, is merely a holding measure made necessary by the application of the High Court to the previous Act in which the High Court discovered <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> informalities which make the passage of this Bill necessary.

*  If what the Attorney-General says is so, my feeling is that we ought to delete the clause from the Bill because the High Court has said that the Australian Industries Preservation Act is a valid Act, that it is within the scope of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and that it is an Act that contained wise provisons that, in later times, seemed to have given some promise of protection to the public against various restrictive practices.

* If as the Attorney-General has suggested, without touching the substance of dealing with monopolisation or predatory price fixing, some alteration of the verbiage would make him happier about conforming with any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements, I am sure that the committee could attend to this before the conclusion of the matter or it could be dealt with elsewhere, now that the principle has been established.

* Earlier statements by the Minister have indicated that there is a role of co-ordinating, cooperating and initiating wilh the States, and constitutionally it is very hard to see how any activity apart from that could be exercised by the Commonwealth in the light of the broad Government policy that it desires to co-operate with the Stales.

* I propose to have something to say in due course about the basis of the motion which has been proposed by  Senator Douglas  McClelland, but before doing so I would like to refer to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis upon which the Commonwealth must determine how it is to act with regard to the broad question of the environment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0)

* I would say, taking what  Senator Byrne  has said as the very basis on which to make worthy comment, that if there is divided authority in the States as to the various bodies which have responsibility in this area it is much more difficult in the Commonwealth area where, lacking the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, it is necessary to look at the incidental work of other bodies.

* If I suggest to them that they have given inadequate appreciation to the difficulties of a new department in' a space of less than 6 months in taking the steps which have to be taken in a very difficult, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> area, where there is a multiplication of authorities which have to be resolved and accommodated in some way, it is noi to deny the fact that there is a need for a recognition of these problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0)

* Quite apart  from  that,  I  hope that the Senate and the  nation  generally  will  recognise that in areas  of  environmental control a very real problem  is  postulated  by  the Federal Constitution,  The  Government has twin policies,  the first of which is  that in these matters involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties it shall  seek  co-operation through the States.

* It is said to me by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and economists that it would be comparatively simple to introduce a Bill to provide for a super tax on incomes over a certain level and that it would be comparatively easy to amend the Income Tax Act to put a limitation on the enormous expense allowances which are enjoyed by those in private industry.

* Whatever action we take in this matter is taken with the greatest regret, but the Parliament would involve itself in an exhibition of contradiction and inconsistency if it did not similarly apply within the area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ability the administrative responsibility available to it and if it did not apply the principle espoused within the last 24 hours in another area of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and administrative responsibility.

* I think that in answering the honourable senator's question I should preface the general answer I give by indicating that the question of the area of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in regard to matters of water pollution and air pollution is hedged with much doubt and many problems as to its extent.

* Therefore to some extent, unless honourable senators wish at this stage to expatiate at length on the contents of this very valuable report, 1 do not see any reason why this motion should be laid aside, I suggest that the Senate should allow this report, by resolution, to go forward to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs.

* On the occasion when he was sworn in as Chief Justice he said that the function of the High Court in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters was to interpret a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> description of power or restraint upon power and to determine whether a given measure falls on one side of a line or on the other.

* But I venture to say,  Mr President,  in the presence of my fellow senators that it was in application of these principles to our own specially important Constitution that the late Chief Justice made his most substantial mark and contributed to the building of a body of doctrine which, in my assessment, will stamp his as an era of exposition superior in importance to the great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> decisions of the Stuart period.

* The last of the four great pillars, as 1 think of his decisions was in the boilermakers' case in which he insisted that no other arm of government should encumber the judiciary by adding to it non-judicial power, and no other arm of government should detract from the judiciary by weakening or undermining its proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> jurisdiction.

* I also raised in the course of this dissent the suggestion that under section 116 of the Constitution it is highly questionable whether it is within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth Government to give financial assistance to the training of teachers who are specifically concerned not only with imparting neutral nonreligious knowledge to students but also with training them in being specifically Catholic, or Presbyterian, or Jewish teachers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0)

* I recognise, however, that there is a substantial difference between the situation in which the Attorney-General is asked to grant his fiat to ensure that public duties are performed and, thereby, to overcome a deficiency when a private citizen has no locus standi because the duty is owed to the public, and the situation where the Attorney-General is, in effect, asked to lend his name to proceedings for the purpose of challenging the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of Commonwealth legislation.

* The High Court held that even if the States gave their 18-year-old citizens the right to vote this did not automatically allow them to have a vote in Federal elections, because the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee of Federal voting  Tights  for those who bad State voting rights applied only  to  those whom the Constitution described as adult persons who, in the understanding of 1901, were persons of 21 years or more.

* The Crown is the symbol of the true association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown it would be in accord with the established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Title shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliament of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

* In other words, the oath that we take in this Parliament is an oath of personal allegiance to the Queen, and obviously it is in strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms because, as I say, that is an oath to the Queen of Australia in the only terms in which constitutionally it may be taken or an affirmation may be made.

* If the agreement were some kind of fraudulent agreement if might be understandablebut are not honourable senators opposite trying to impose as many difficulties, as many troubles, as many technicalities and as much doubt as they can in a field which already has enough of them because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations.

* In the absence of any decision by that authority which, under the Australian Constitution, has the exclusive right to determine vexing and disputed questions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, namely the High Court, it was very difficult to determine which of the 2 authorities had the appropriate jurisdiction.

* I say that it is unlikely that that type of scheme will ever again be presented in this country because the Committee which the Senate appointed, virtually as the condition upon which the legislation passed through the Senate, reported that there were some aspects of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities in which the legislation was deficient. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0)

* It is alleged that the provisions of section 51 placitum 31, which requires land to be acquired on just terms, do not apply to Territories under the control of the Commonwealth and that in respect of Territories such as the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees of section 51 do not apply. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0)

* While we cannot give residents of the Territories a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee, we believe that there is an obligation on the Parliament to ensure that a Bill applying to Territories does not set out criteria which are not just terms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0)

* For those reasons and because we think it is highly undesirable that one area of Australia, because it happens to come under Commonwealth jurisdiction and finds itself exempt from some other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement, should be able to have a discriminatory administrative policy in this respect, the Australian Democratic Labor Party will oppose the legislation and vote against it.

* If the legislation is rejected in this chamber, we hope that the Commonwealth will reconsider the matter and come to terms with those whose properties are already the subject of compensation discussions and those involved in the other matter and will negotiate on the proper terms in the light of what I would call the principles of equity that should prevail irrespective of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> technicalities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0)

* The Committee states in its report that it believed that the features of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) legislation to which it had taken objection arose directly because the issue of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority had not been resolved.

* A <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> referendum to enable the Federal Government to control both prices and incomes will be held in December and, within the past 10 months, the Federal Government has sought to restrain inflationary pressures through currency revaluation and across the board tariff cuts on imported goods.

* It would be hard not to do so because the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> realities in Australia, whether people like it or not, are that the States have been given the power by the Constitution in relation to education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0)

* What has happened with the Schools Commission is a recognition that there is clearly a role to be played on a national basis but that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> realities are that the day to day administration of education in the States is a State function carried out by the State departments of education, with the exception of the nongovernment sector which, again, is not a direct administrative responsibility of the Commonwealth.

* Then there are to be 3 other members of whom one shall be appointed by the Episcopal Conference, which was adverted to by  Senator Wheeldon  and in respect of which there would be very grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt because, as he has pointed out, it has not been approved by Archbishop Cahill, I think it is, who is the man most qualified to speak in this area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0)

* I have heard suggestions at different times that there would be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge to legislation of this character as it affected independent schools, and it would appear to me that one point which would be inquired into by people opposed to independent schools would be whether aid, if it is given to schools, might be challenged under the Constitution, whereas by giving aid to children it would not perhaps be so obviously open to challenge. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0)

* I do not want to get involved in what could be thought to be the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arguments or the relationships between the 2 Houses, but I come down on the side of a Bill and against a joint meeting on this very simple proposition: I believe that is the simplest, cleanest and best way to resolve this problem. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0)

* Whereas previously we argued that there were some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> barriers to a joint meeting of the 2 Houses,  Senator Murphy  now says that there would be just an expression of opinion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0)

* If in any other case the 2 Houses wish to reconcile their point of view if they are in difference, we provided for it if it is a case outside section 57 and we provided for it in a way which preserves the integrity of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0)

* If we want to get this matter solved in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way, if we want to get it solved effectively, and if we want to get the procedure that will give the Parliament the promptest decision, I urge the Senate to reject the proposal for a joint tete-a-tete meeting at which a vote would be taken without debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0)

* So for all these reasons- our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, promptness and effectiveness of decision and the appropriateness of discussion of the decision- I would urge that the Senate should not accept the resolution from the House below.

* And whereas the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States have decided, in the national interest, that, without raising questions concerning, and without derogating from, their respective <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, they should co-operate for the purpose of ensuring the legal  effeciveness  of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of  those  submerged lands.

* Before I read the conclusions to the Senate I would like to refer to the first term of reference which was:  whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation is consistent with the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0)

* That the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation is inconsistent with what should be the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship between the Parliament and the executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0)

* That, in the context of broad <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities,  there  is a challenge to the exercise of the functions of Parliament in the conception of uniform legislation drafted by the executive arms of seven Australian Governments being presented to the Parliaments as a fait accompli requiring formal legislative approval. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0)

* This cannot be regarded as strictly inconsistent with the 'proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities' of the Commonwealth and the States as the power always lies  with the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States to reject or amend the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0)

* That the Committee does not regard the legislation as being inconsistent with the 'proper responsibilities' of the Commonwealth and the States because, as a result of a decision to avoid litigation which would have resolved the matter, it cannot say what is the measure of those proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities.

* I believe that it is quite important that the Senate should look to the Karmel Committee report and particularly to 2 sections of it which spell out quite clearly the recognition of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation that education is and should remain a primary function of the States and also that there is an overriding virtue in decentralisation and devolution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* In relation to this I would again draw upon the Karmel Committee report which in a great number of places relied on and gave great emphasis to the importance, as the Committee saw it, of the considerations of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41)

* As I have pointed out the Minister himself repeatedly said in his second reading speech and the Karmel Committee said at page  132  of its report that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility does lie primarily with the States as does the present commitment.

* After exhaustive investigation, the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1958, and again in 1959, recognised the vital interest of the people in proposed <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> alterations.

* The Committee's proposal would not disturb the Federal fabric of the Constitution, inherent in section 128, but its proposal would serve to lay more emphasis on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> change by the democratic process of majority vote than there at present exists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original 6 States, means in the elegant words of the Constitution Review Committee that 'for every State in which there is an adverse vote there must be a favourable vote in two states ... a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States. ' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* I am looking forward to the results of the deliberations of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention so that as Australia moves into the next 30 years we can have a completely new distribution of power, so that the States no longer will feel themselves to be mendicants at the table of the Commonwealth and so that the Commonwealth will know at any time in view of its new international responsibilities just where it is going, where its areas of power, clearly and undisputably will lie and the States will have not only the responsibility for certain things but will have the means at their disposal without having to resort to alternative sources of finance by way of annual agreements or special approaches to finance their duties within the Constitution.

* If there is an argument based on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fight which may follow if this Bill is passed, I believe that one should look to the view expressed by  Mr Good,  Q.C., who was Solicitor-General of Western Australia.

* One the Committee itself identified in saying, when considering whether the legislation was consistent with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conceptions that underlay the responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, that in the legislation it was impossible to identify any Minister who, vis-a-vis this Parliament, had responsibility, and vis-a-vis the Victorian Parliament any Minister who in respect of the Western Australian off-shore oil had responsibility.

* For all the plea which is made, for all the acknowledgement which is inherent in the second reading of this Bill that this is an area where <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority should be resolved, the practical requirements require a co-operative arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth.

* When we consider the weight, seriousness and the sheer number of the Bills which the Senate is being asked to considerBills that affect the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in Australia, Bills that affect the social order in Australia, Bills that affect domestic relations in Australia, Bills that affect the national health scheme and things like that- and matters, such as the Trade Practices Bill, that concern the commercial life and the trade union life of Australia, it must be realised that these things are of such moment that to try to deal with them ad hoc in the quick rush towards the end of a session would be unthinkable and indefensible.

* I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Is it not a fact that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in Sydney in the first week of September this year the Commonwealth Government agreed that numerous topics suggested as involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment should be referred to standing committees of the Convention for detailed consideration and report?

* As I stand here and remind myself of the arguments that persuaded me in 1959 to dissent from the views of the other eleven, it is not much wonder that I stood my ground because as I restate the arguments I am more than ever convinced that the Senate needs the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> stability and safeguards to which I have referred.

* I rise briefly to expound a point of view which although not very much listened to in this place is, I am sure, appreciated by those who out of principle make <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> study their preoccupation, that it is necessary that we remind ourselves from time to time of the reasons why these differences exist.

* The proposal to alter the provision concerning the alteration of the Constitution to 3 States from the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement of four appears to me to be a denial of the concept of the banding together of a series of colonies and States into a federation.

* It would mean that, if a majority of the people- we wish to extend that from a majority of the people in the States to a majority of the whole of the people of Australia, whether in the Territories or in the States- were in favour of a proposal and at least half of the States were to vote for the proposal, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum would be taken to be approved.

* More particularly, in view of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which has been convened, which has sat already and is continuing its deliberations, it would be inappropriate if the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relations of the Commonwealth were allowed to be redetermined and redefined, as no doubt they will be in some areas if the recommendations of that Convention are adopted, and it would be inappropriate if at the same time the diversity of law were allowed to continue without interruption and the systems were allowed to continue to develop in their own way.

* I think everyone would agree that a person who has publicly identified himself against a particular <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> view would, from a commonsense point of view, hardly be likely to be the person selected to present a case on behalf of the Commonwealth in favour of that view of the Constitution.

* Like  Senator Davidson,  I should like to know whether it is intended to direct- and, of course, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth to direct is somewhat hedged around in matters of this nature- incoming migrants to this Albury-Wodonga area.

* However, as the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has before it this other major investigation which it will conduct in the month of February so that it can report back to the Senate in March, it would not be altogether appropriate that this Bill similarly should go to that Committee.

* The words would make more sense if directed by the Prime Minister to his Caucus, for I would imagine that if Caucus makes the Prime Minister back down on many more issues he just might use his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to take them all back to the electorate, even if some of them would be left swinging.

* Being conscious that he cannot achieve unification by direct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means, he is setting out to achieve unification little by little, in the hope that he will disintegrate the State forces and will have substituted for them regional areas which will become dependent upon his direct largess.

* All that honourable senators on this side are suggesting is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes laid down be observed and that they should not be dented or perverted to suit the whim or the convenience of an impulsive government which, in another place this afternoon, was so unenthusiastic about another <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal that it could not whip up the required <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> majority.

* As  Senator Wright  indicated, the reasons why half the Senate would be called to an election would not be based upon the Senate's performance or on any sound or established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> criteria, but simply as a reaction to, an inevitable result of, what was happening internally within the House of Representatives.

* In my opinion the Senate's action in sending the proposed law to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on 4 December 1973, particularly when construed in the light of the failure of the Committee to meet to consider the matter, constituted a failure to pass the proposed law within the meaning of section 128 of the Constitution.

* If we are to accept the argument put yesterday by the Government senators that we would be acting undemocratically in not allowing the proposal to go to the people then I ask this quesiton and I would like to hear the comments of Government senators on this proposition when they reply: If a Bill which would submit a proposal for an alteration of the Constitution to the people should pass through the Senate with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> majority of 31 votes, go to the House of Representatives, and be rejected and then, after an interval of 3 months, again be passed by the Senate with a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> majority of 3 1 votes, would the Government give an absolute undertaking that it would advise the Governor-General to submit that proposal to the people? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* But then we come to standing order 242.I submit that the only construction that you can give to that, if you adhere to prevailing rulings as to the reconciliation between section 23 of the Constitution and the standing order which requires an absolute majority either to pass the third reading of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bill or to suspend Standing Orders, is to disregard the second sentence of standing order 242.I say that if you continue to apply the rulings that have been given on the standing order on suspension of Standing Orders, because it has been held that on the passage of a simple majority, notwithstanding the standing order requirement of an absolute majority, the simple majority prevailed.

* I put that to you,  Mr President,  because I can foresee that if the Government does not wish to take the opinion of the judicial structure, the Governor-General may request that that be done, such, I believe, is the complication on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter in which the processes of today have involved us.

* In doing so I am not deterred in any way by the argument repeatedly advanced on behalf of the Government in this chamber, in the course of this debate and earlier debates on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills, that somehow or other it is none of the business of the Senate, one of the 2 Houses of Parliament, to deter or impede the Government in putting its suggestions for alteration of the Constitution to the people.

* If any proposal has the prospect of support by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, by all parties in Parliament, by State governments and State oppositions and by the people, I believe it should be divorced from the situation in which hotly contentious issues are submitted at a referendum.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* The position appears to be that some support in principle for the idea of an interchange of powers was made at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, but no reference of this Bill with its specific content has been made to the individual States and no attempt has been made to get the States to agree or disagree with the substantive content of the proposed new sections 108a or 108b.

* I have to stress the fact that this Government has endeavoured to refer matters of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change to the Australian people, not to make some back door arrangement, not to attempt to bypass public opinion, but rather to give the Australian people an opportunity to have a 1970 look at the Constitution, which people should know is now well over 70 years old.

* The Prime Minister is seeking to extend it, and I think I have indicated that in his desire to do this he will be recognised not only by the Australian people but ultimately by historians as a person who was prepared to go to the full extent of the democratic procedures to convince the Australian electorate to change the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions relating to powers between the Commonwealth and the States.

* Government senators have said in this debate, as they have said over and over again when speaking on other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration legislation, that somehow or other the Senate is not really entitled to consider independently or to oppose Bills which provide for the alteration of the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* How naive is the proposition which was put this afternoon by  Senator James  McClelland that we, with that responsibility on our shoulders, should simply say that, even though we may be opposed to a particular <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, even though we may believe that this is a matter that should be given further consideration, and even though it is a matter which perhaps vitally affects the States and which the State governments and the State parliaments should be given the opportunity to discuss before it is put to the people, we should not give any consideration or weight to these things; we should simply pass this Bill through the Senate without exercising any of the responsibilities and judgment which, as I said, are placed upon our shoulders by the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* The proposal to amend the Constitution in this Bill is, in my view, a very minor question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* It may be in the process of considering it, but at this stage it is merely a proposal which emanated from the informal meeting which took place at the time of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention between the Prime Minister and 5 of the 6 State Premiers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* It does leave one with an uneasy feeling as to why this Bill should now be rushed on by the Government ahead of all the other major questions for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment which are being discussed by a committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* So we are left with this measure, supported only in principle by the Premiers of 5 States- a principle which is still being considered by a  Committee  of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and which was, as I said, a relatively minor issue before that Convention by comparison with many other major <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes which are under consideration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* Therefore I believe it is again trying to hoodwink some of the State Premiers or State Opposition leaders into believing that under this proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration the States will gain some benefit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* It is not really in a meaningful way to provide for a 2-way process as the Government represents in the hope of getting support from the States and in the hope of softening them up for many other major <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes designed to transfer more and more power from the States to the Commonwealth Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* In other words, this Parliament is given a very definitive place and role in the presentation and passage of a proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* I would say that any honourable senator who thinks otherwise in relation to the passage of this Bill completely misconceives his individual duty and completely misconceives the role that the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Parliament at large must play in the presentation and passage of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments.

* Indeed, in the unitary system in a country of British origins the judicial system is of very great importance, but in a federal system it is of unique importance inasmuch as there is entrusted to the judicial courts a determination of <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> powers as between Federal and State parliaments and instrumentalities, and citizens' rights dependent upon different laws have to be adjudicated upon.

* The kinds of litigation are defined by reference to factors which for the most part relate either to the character of the litigants or to the question of law arising; e.g., that the litigants are residents of different States, or that the Commonwealth is a party, or that a resident of one State sues another State, that the litigation raises a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question, or that it arises under a law of the Commonwealth.

* His  Honour cited various difficulties that arose and at page 101 showed how, by raising matters within the description of sections 75 and 76- the same description as is applied in clause 19 of the Bill - your adversary can delay you and can raise a new point of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> nature.

* If this is accepted as the permissible interpretation of section 57, if it is accepted as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law of this country, the Senate can no longer effectively carry out its high responsibilities and duties in any shape or form, and certainly cannot act as a House reviewing legislation.

* Sir Ronald  Ferguson again made the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position quite plain in the following passages:  1 am advised further that to accede to the request contained in your Address would imply a recognition of a right in the Senate to make the Ministers of State for the Commonwealth directly responsible to that Chamber for advice tendered to the Governor-General in relation to the exercise of an Executive power vested in him by the terms of the Constitution, and that such a recognition would not be in accordance with the accepted principles of responsible government.

* If, as you request me to do, I should reject their advice, supported as it is by the considered opinion of the House of Representatives, and should act upon the equally considered contrary opinion of the Senate, my conduct would, 1 fear, even on ordinary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds, amount to an open personal preference of one House against the other- in other words, an act of partisanship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* But there is another reason- and that is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes of section 57 of the Constitution have not yet run their course. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* In the Government's view, it would not be constitutionally proper to table the legal opinions before the joint sitting is held. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* Irrespective of what might be the option in this chamber, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions will enable the weight of numbers of the House of Representatives to ensure that that Bill becomes law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* In the case of this Bill, surely it is important for us to know and to be satisfied that the situation of deadlock- the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions of deadlock- have been reached. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* So we in this chamber have introduced an amendment which sets out the chronology, which sets out the events and which demonstrates that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions have not been satisfied. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* We suggest that when these facts are set out there is one interpretation which stands out, and that is the prima facie interpretation that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions have not been satisfied. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* The Government ought to recognise that the rights which the Constitution confers are rights which all parties, whether they are in government or in opposition, ought to protect because they are in due course the only protections in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy which we can rely upon. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* He suggests that it is constitutionally inappropriate for the Senate to concern itself with these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* He suggests that it is constitutionally futile. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* This situation, as the Governor-General indicated, represented the proprieties of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government- the proprieties of responsible government- and one does not doubt that in a unitary system that is the situation which ought to prevail. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* It is open to the Governor-General to obtain advice on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question from other quarters- perhaps from the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General or eminent counseland then a solemn responsibility rests on him to make a judgment on whether a dissolution is needed to serve the purposes of good Government by giving to the electorate the duty of resolving a situation which Parliament cannot resolve for itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* The facts relate a story which I think quite clearly indicates that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements have not been complied with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0)

* In response to the amendment, the AttorneyGeneral,  Senator Murphy,  made a speech to the Senate during the course of which he raised matters of principle which go far beyond the importance or the significance of this Bill and which go right to the heart of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy, the concept of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State and therefore to the democratic institution in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* These matters should be examined as such because, if  Senator Murphy's  statement tonight is to prevail, the concept of the GovernorGeneral as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State will become a much narrower and much more delimited function and a function which, without any offence, would be that of a puppet response to government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* He was very careful never to say that it was constitutionally illegal for the Senate to proceed in terms of the amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* We were told that it would be constitutionally improper and constitutionally futile to take such action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* I submit that quite clearly the Attorney-General tonight by his silence on the question of constitutionality made it clear that  Senator Durack  's amendment is entirely <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* The Opposition is saying that it has a duty, a responsibility and a clear right to make known to every person in this country- to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and his Cabinet, to the Government and to the people of Australiawhat the Opposition regards as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position under this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* To conceive the idea that a Governor-General should be so isolated from the community that he should not be able to respond to events in the community and that he should not be capable of perusing and being influenced by the debates in this or any other chamber is to deny the fundamental duty of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State over the centuries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* It is the primary duty of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State, whether monarch or Governor-General, to brief himself or herself fully on the happenings of the day and the happenings in the life and public affairs of the community, so that when a decision is to be taken the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head is fully aware of the events and can bring down an independent judgment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* I felt that  Senator Murphy's  speech tonight was the socialist Left view of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head who must, under a socialist view, simply be there in a puppet fashion to do the will of the Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* Quite clearly, no one denies the competence of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head to seek that advice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchs of England over the centuries regarded this duty as their primary duty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* Tonight the Attorney-General said, in effect, that there is no individual discretion in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* It would be wrong and it would be grave, because within the powers of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State the discretions are vital and important. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* Therefore, the Senate has not been asked by the Attorney-General to put aside the amendment because it is unconstitutional. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* It was interesting tonight that there was no opinion, hastily secured, from the Solicitor-General or from the AttorneyGeneral's Department- no legal opinion about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the Opposition to move this amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* All that has been said is that it is constitutionally improper and constitutionally futile. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* It was contemplated that the Parliament would meet in mid-February of this year, but the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  decided that he would seek a formal opening of the Parliament by  Her  Majesty the Queen, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State, and in order to do so it was necessary to prorogue the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56)

* If there is some dissension as to whether the Bill is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, I hope that the High Court will fix up that dispute. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0)

* No further progress can be made in this matter until this very difficult legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question is resolved by the High Court of Australiathe question which we facilitated, by vote in the Senate last year, being put to the High Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0)

* The Opposition believes that although it is appropriate for the question of the Commonwealth's sovereignty over the off-shore areas to be resolved, although we support the claim to sovereignty and although we support in principle the idea that the Commonwealth Government should have a broad legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sovereignty over these areas, when all is said and done we are even at the present time engaged in an international conference at which we are asserting very broad claims over the continental shelf extending seawards 200 miles or more. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0)

* It was in the light of that report and the facts relating to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right of either the States or the Commonwealth to have control over the off-shore submerged lands around this great continent that the original Bill- the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill- was given first and second readings by the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0)

* The question of whether the Commonwealth or the States has the responsibility within the Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework for the exercise of rights arising or the performance of obligations accepted under the International Convention on the Continental Shelf and under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone is undecided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0)

* Having regard to what Justices of the High Court have saidand all witnesses who gave evidence on this aspect generally concurred- it would appear that the Commonwealth has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate under its external affairs power to give effect to international obligations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0)

* If they do so, it would mean that in significant and, possibly, expanding areas the Commonwealth heads of power would become more extensive than the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions expressly contemplate- and, consequentially, reduce the exclusive area of State authority.

* Regrettably Opposition senators refused to debate that Bill and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> considerations relating to double dissolutions of Parliament then led to a similar Bill being introduced in another place.

* If the law of this country is to deteriorate into such a state that the entire <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure can be broken down- chiselled here, modified here- by a mere wilful Act of Parliament, then the people of Australia will find themselves in a very sorry, desperate state of affairs.

* On the contrary I believe that the right course for this Government and this Parliament to follow is to take this matter to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions between the Commonwealth, the States and local government, to invite Territorial representatives to those conventions, and to have protracted discussion on the future nature and structure of the Territories, their movement into full statehood and their representation in this Parliament.

* As I have said in this Parliament and will keep repeating for as long as that assertion about the Government having a mandate to do certain things is made: There is not one <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to which the Government can point- the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is a Queen's Counsel- who will maintain the mandate doctrine in our system of government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4)

* I believe analysis shows, even if it should be that this Bill proves to be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>- that is a matter for the courts to decide, not for anyone to say what he thinks will happen- that it gives practically uncontrolled power to the proposed Authority and to the Minister and the Government and provides for practically no parliamentary oversight.

* But 1 want to emphasise that there is no reason whatsoever, if the State governments are sincere in their professed desire to protect consumers, why there should not be a referral of power so that firms and individuals can be embraced within that part of the legislation and also to set at rest any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubts there may be in respect of its validity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0)

* If they did so they would at least be seen to be sincere and it would be apparent that there were at least some areas in which they were prepared to take a national approach and the criticism based on any alleged <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> invalidity would completely disappear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0)

* This Bill, if it is enacted, will deprive the consumers of that opportunity to have claims referred, because under section 109, the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> position is such that this would no longer be possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0)

* A brewery within the confines of Tasmania was alleged to be monopolising trade against Carlton and United Breweries Ltd.

* If the view we have expressed is correct and constitutionally the State legislation in respect of these tribunals will be wiped out as far as an individual dealing with a corporation is concerned, there will be a great loss to the consumers and to consumer organisations; they will be unable to deal in that area in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0)

* The position therefore is that, as has been said time and again, the inclusion of this Part in the legislation at the moment will lead to confusion, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt and probably a denial of some rights which consumers have at present.

* But there is a genuine doubt as to whether a Commonwealth legislative enactment is the most efficacious way of proceeding and whether accession to the Convention and the provision of the abilities which this Convention grants will be provided on a sure <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0)

* I would be interested to know the way in which the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  views the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base upon which the legislation is framed, because it does appear that the opportunity to enforce arbitration agreements or to rely upon awards made in foreign arbitrations is a right which citizens have in the conduct of their litigation within Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0)

* Are we to assume from this arrangement that  Senator Greenwood  was prepared to accept a representative of the DLP as being entitled to be in attendance at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention but is not prepared to give like representation to  Senator Hall,  who is a selfprofessed Liberal? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0)

* But regardless of the petty attitude of the Opposition in this chamber, which is prepared to wreck the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention rather than have  Senator Hall  attend in the place of the former Australian Democratic Labor Party representatives who mercifully are no longer represented here, it appears that the Convention could not be held in any event.

* Before I deal with some matters of detail I wish to place on record 2 facts; firstly that I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which examined the detailed provisions of this Bill and, secondly, that over a long period I practised professionally in this jurisdiction in the State of Tasmania both at supreme court and lower court levels.

* First of all, it was a proposal from the Government- an honourable senator on the Government side- which we agreed to quite some time ago before the debate took place in the other place, that this National Compensation Bill should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for further investigation.

* Since this Government came into power we have had 6 referenda, not one of which has been carried and not one of which was submitted to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention beforehand in an effort to obtain support from the representatives of the States as a means of achieving that sort of consensus which experience ought to have demonstrated was necessary for the carrying of referenda in this country.

* Senate procedures, at some stage after 16 August the names of the members of that committee were communicated to the  President  and the Committee- the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- was formally constituted.

* The reports of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs ought to be considered and the views ought to be able to be taken into account by those who are interested in the ultimate form which this legislation will take. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* To really understand that you have to go to the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which is a time consuming task as I can assure anyone who wants to undertake it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* I stop there in my reading simply to say that I would have thought that there is considerable doubt as to whether, in regard to that proposed jurisdiction, there is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for such a court to be established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* I do not know how this problem can be resolved if the Senate is of the opinion that such a court should be established, but I urge the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  to consider the problems with which the Commonwealth Government was faced after the High Court decisions of Knight v. Knight and Kotzis v. Kotzis in 1970, because the result of those High Court decisions was that awards of maintenance and awards of custody made by commissioners of Supreme Courts who had been unconstitutionally invested with a jurisdiction which the High Court declared they did not have, were orders and awards without any valid operation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* If in some way this issue as to whether there is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power can be raised for consideration before it is acted upon- supposing that the clauses go through- I think that a lot of the problems in the future can be resolved, because it would be absolutely disastrous to have a family court established as a Commonwealth court of record in which the decisions made by that court were not sustained by the High Court.

* We do not have the same <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework as America has but we ought to recognise that there are different types of family court structures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* We ought to have one in Australia which is consonant with our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations and divisions of power as determined by the High Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* If, as I read elsewhere in this report, the family court is to be a superior court of record, there is no question of in general judges being appointed for life; it is a matter of law and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that every judge of a Federal Court should be appointed for life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* Embarrassments upon embarrassments will be caused if constitutionally the situation cannot be sustained and in terms of appointments, structures, staff and court buildings it will add an enormous expense in an area where there is no occasion for those enormous problems to be encountered.

* In relation to  Senator James  McClelland 's attitude and his reference to the Festival of Light, this was a very poor exhibition by no less a person than the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* It is true that a good deal of the Bill deals with marriage dissolution but the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power extends further than that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

 Senator Everett referred to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I think this Bill has some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects which ought not to be overlooked. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* To that extent I think the name of the Bill goes beyond what could be regarded and ought properly to be regarded as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* In doing so I should perhaps point out to  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson that I think  Senator Everett  referred to the long title of the Bill in the context of saying that that really reflected the use of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I suppose in the Senate chamber where we are not concerned fundamentally with where <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power ultimately lies one cannot speak in terms other than the risk of what is being done. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* Maybe all will go well until at some late stage a person will rely upon a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point and the edifice will come tumbling down. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I would say that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> provision is quite clear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* These words are words of caution and if we are to embark, as this legislation proposes, upon giving to the Commonwealth a wide power and to give to all the instrumentalities to be established by this Bill power to make decrees and orders on applications of that character and subsequently they should be found to be invalid as beyond <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, it is fair to say that people will be denied what they believed they had received and were entitled to. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* -The amendment which  Senator Greenwood  has moved goes to the very heart of this Bill and certainly to the very heart of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs because, if it succeeds and if these amendments are made to the definition of matrimonial cause', we may be sure that practically all that is sought of substance in the Bill will be defeated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* A very valuable work on this precise subject- the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth to regulate family relations- by Professor Sackville, who is known to all honourable senators, and by Professor Howard, who is the General Counsel to the Attorney-General, is reported in the 1974 Federal Law Review at page 30. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* One thing is clear: lt is not suggested that this approach ought not to be taken if it can constitutionally be taken. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* As I understand it, no argument is raised against the desirability of the definition, if that can be done constitutionally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I would ask the Senate not to alter the definition because to do so would really take away the features of this legislation which I think have been generally applauded as very great advances and if they are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> they are eminently in the public interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I think  Sir Garfield  Barwick and the Parliament in 1959 looked at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and they sought, consistently with earlier definitions, to limit the operation of the Act to that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* But I invite him to consider that if in this area <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power is lacking legislation will not rectify the position because there is no Commonwealth power to rectify it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I do not know how the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs adverted to these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* One is that I do not advocate this because of some hope or desire alone that this is within <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* Therefore I suggest that all these powers should be put within the ambit of matrimonial cause and should be transferred, in my opinion and the opinion of some members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, in many cases to the State courts, which are to be known as family courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* This is not the proper forum to try to analyse the width of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* Certainly the view that the Commonwealth has not exhausted its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in this area finds support from the High Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* After careful attention, careful consideration and careful draftsmanship, it is considered that this fits within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I am satisfied that we should proceed and not be deterred by what is suggested by  Senator Greenwood  about possible lack of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* Once again I urge  Senator Greenwood  to study the document which emerged from the deliberations of the Senate <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* In regard to this matter the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommended: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* Most of the amendments proposed by the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs were adopted by the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  and that is why he has been moving them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I notice- I think I am correct in saying this-that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs did not make any recommendation with regard to this question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I have been talking to the  Chairman  of the Senate <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee and he and I both have a distinct recollection that when this matter was discussed by that Committee the feeling was that the whole of the words proposed in the AttorneyGeneral 's original amendment No. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* -Senator Greenwood will be pleased to hear that, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, I agree with the observations he makes with respect to clause 14 (6) (a) regarding the words 'an opportunity to consider'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* May I say that this is one of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* The second point I make is that the Committee considered that amendment was desirable in order to increase the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> strength of the power contained in the proposed new clause 14a- in other words, that the availability of the counselling facilities should be pursuant to a formal filing of a document invoking those facilities in the Family Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* One other argument prevailed strongly on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when making its recommendation to change 'notice of marriage breakdown' to notice' so that a person can seek the counselling facilities of the court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I think that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs took the matter as far as that in its considerations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* It is desired by the members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to extend that so that people do not necessarily have to institute divorce proceedings to secure a settlement of property. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* So it will probably have greater <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity than if the proposed clause were not there. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I appreciate what  Senator Baume  is putting, but the ever present concern is that which was mentioned earlier this evening, that is, the question of constitutionality. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* If you give assistance to a person as a person you might be getting into something that is not quite as related to marriage or to the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> heads of power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I do not suppose that anybody will greatly challenge it, but some attention has been paid to the available heads of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power even in that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* Thirdly, whilst I fully appreciate and can see the points which the Attorney-General makes about the need to have regard to the head of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, this is a facilitatory area in which one would not believe that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions are likely to cause concern. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* I would have thought, without harking back to an earlier debate, that there is more problem about heads of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in other areas than in this area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* This is based on the recommendation contained in paragraph 30 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

* The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommended that there should be a Family Court of Australia which was to be a superior court of record, and that the jurisdiction ought to be vested in it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0)

* I propose to say a few words on this matter because undoubtedly the creation of the Family Court, whether it be Federal entirely or State and Federal, is of great interest to the members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, lt was, of course, a major part of the recommendations that that Committee put forward- that there certainly should be a family court taking up all the jurisdictions which were otherwise spread in a great mass of courts, in different ways, and which were a constant cause of jumping from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the cause likewise of cost and of frustration for litigants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* I hope that this Senate will see the wisdom of adding to that the State concept which the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee recommended and mentioned in its report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* During the second reading debate I. made a comment about the place of family courts and  Senator James  McClelland indicated by way of interjection that some of the things I was hoping family courts could achieve probably had no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* If there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limit to what can be done by the Commonwealth I think we have a pretty strong argument for inviting the States to be involved in the setting up and operation of family courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* I have read and re-read what the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs said about this matter of a family court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* Then there is a recognition that because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitation that judges must be appointed for life, there are problems which the Committee wants to overcome. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* The Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to appoint officers to State courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* Not only will the probable division of labour between the Superior Court and courts of summary jurisdiction be in inverse relationship to the intricacy of the respective subject matters with which they will be dealing, but important areas of family law will, for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons remain outside the scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* Drawing support from what Professor Finlay has said I emphasise that he recognised this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitation upon this concept of family law which the Bill is not prepared to recognise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* I believe that all of these factors are indications of some limitation upon the efficacy of a Commonwealth Family Court on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis and in the area of jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee is entirely in agreement with the idea that you cannot reform the summary courts and get them sufficiently into the position where they can deal properly with these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* Three members of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee advocate State courts and this is contained in the report as a suggestion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* I would have thought it would have struck him right at the outset as having <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which he would not have thought would have been so easily passed over as, in fact, they have been passed over. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* I agreed, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, to amendment No. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* They owe allegiance to the Crown as do members of Parliament and all other officers who are charged with responsibilities which are part of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> frame. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* Before we put the remainder of the clause that deals with the Family Court I wonder if the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  or the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs would inform me whether the proposed amendments with regard to the establishment of the Family Court have embraced some of the comments that were made in the Senate Committee's report with regard to the functions and activities which we would hope would be envisaged in the service that this Court would give. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* This is an amendment which the Liberal members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs at least, consider of great importance to the operation of this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* Yet because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations and other limitations which flow from the very provisions of this Bill, the State Family Courts must be inferior, they must be second class compared with the Federal Family Court.

* A fourth point is that judges of State family courts could not, because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations, exercise the jurisdiction which would be conferred on the Federal Family Court under proposed sections 17m(1), 17m(2), 17ma and 17n because those proposed sections deal with a jurisdiction which flows from the Marriage Act and that could not, except by the leave of this Parliament, be conferred on State courts.

* As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, it seems to me that this section departs from the whole notion of a family court as that Committee saw it.

* But in this piece of legislation- subject to the argument which has gone on before in which  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Everett  have perhaps been the main protagonists- we have to see this matter at this stage of the Committee debate as a proper exercise of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64)

* I remind the Senate, as I said in my speech on the second reading of this Bill, that with this sort of power being extended by Bill after Bill passed by this House, the States are rapidly becoming <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> skeletons and ultimately will become unnecessary in the system of Australian Government.

* It must be remembered that it was not this Parliament, not the Opposition, not any element of the Parliament other than the Government which moved in August 1973 that the Parliament should set up a joint committee which had as its special reference the responsibility of reporting on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of self government in the Northern Territory.

* As the Committee had already reported to the Parliament it sought a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> formula to require the Parliament or Governor of a State in making an appointment to fill a casual vacancy arising in the Senate, to choose some one who was a member of the same political party as the senator whose place had become vacant.

* The Committee desired to recommend a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment whereby, if the senator for a State whose place has become vacant was a member of a political party, the Parliament of the State or the Governor of the State should be required, in filling the vacancy, to choose a person who was a member of the same political party as the vacating senator.

* I also support it with a feeling of sadness in that I look across at the Opposition benches and I see a number of honourable senators who, over a long period of years, have proclaimed their insistence on the observance of the Constitution and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions; yet on this issue and in this context, purely to give some protective ointment to the Premier of New South Wales they retreat from those convictions that they have professed so strongly over such a long period.

* In addition the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959 recommended in paragraph 59 and 60 of its report as follows: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Committee desired to recommend a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment whereby, if the senator for a Sta"; whose place has become vacant was a member of a political party, the Parliament of the State or the Governor of the State should be required, in filling the vacancy, to choose a person who was a member of the same political party as the vacating senator. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* This is probably one of the reasons why in the past the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review found difficulty in phrasing an amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* My re-reading of the debate satisfies me that  Senator Withers  was making the important point that the way in which the Federal Government of this country has in recent months and years treated the States, the actions by the Government both in regard to the Gair affair and in regard to the interference by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment with the States' rights in regard to the Senate by introducing non-State representatives and also the attacks that have constantly been made on States and the infringement of their powers have left many State leaders in a position where they considerably fear the intentions of this Government, and I think justifiably so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* If the Liberal Party as the great upholder of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> tradition in this country and the great upholder of the position of the Senate does not view this possible departure from that convention with the greatest concern and if it attempts to substitute that view of greatest concern with one of commendation, it will be a somewhat meek and mealy-mouthed form of the tradition which has prevailed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is sad that the Party of  Sir Robert  Menzies which in 1 95 1 , defeated on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill by the decision of the High Court, took appropriate steps constitutionallysteps which a Party in that position should take- and sought a referendum to obtain power in connection with that issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* My second purpose is mainly to take advantage of this occasion to put on record the ramshackle situation that is left in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions with regard to casual vacancies in this place which I have lived to learn has become much more important even in my time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* But if I go further and say that it would be fair in political discussion for people to be anxious as to the purpose of the appointment- that the Attorney-General who promoted certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> claims which are being contested by the States should be translated from the AttorneyGeneralship to the High Court for the purpose of giving weight in the adjudication o." [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* But the third point about it is that these disciples of elevated <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> integrity- I notice that  Senator Everett  is out of the chamber at the moment, and I wish expressly to bring him within the aura of the phrase- ought to give credit to the Opposition in the Senate when it does maintain the Constitution and established conventions, and when the Opposition goes further and commends to the parliaments of the States the practice that has been observed in this regard they might become a little generous in their understanding. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0)

* In addition to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions and conventions the Opposition commends the acceptance of and compliance with the practices that have been observed in regard to section 15.

* Without a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to section 15 of the Constitution, the Parliament could not go on and fulfil completely in the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act the only method by which proportionalrepresentation could be completely applied.

* They may take the view that having that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility they are bound to take into consideration all sorts of matters affecting the public interest of this Commonwealth and their State as well as the practice that has been developed in connection with filling casual vacancies since 1949. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* Because of the added importance of casual vacancies as a result of proportional representation ensuring fairly evenly divided Senates, it was recommended that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision for the rilling of casual vacancies should be reviewed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* That was understood by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, of which I was a member, as was the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* The Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review considered providing the review that the double dissolution committee had recommended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* As reported in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee's report the Committee found it impossible to devise a provision which would allow for the transmission of votes according to party nomination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* I think we might reflect that there were the greatest difficulties before the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee in writing in a specific provision that would become <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law requiring that the successor on a casual vacancy should be a member of the same party as the vacating senator. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* One need only state these points to see that it is quite inappropriate, as the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review decided, to write a rigid formula of words into the Constitution to give effect to this practice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* If an appointment to the High Court is for the purpose of giving strength to a judicial position by the participation of an Attorney-General who has already advised on highly important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters- I do not say that is the position, I previously referred to it by way of explanationif the nominee of a political party was on other than political grounds completely unacceptable to the big majority of the members of the State Houses, if a member of a political party had changed his political allegiance during his membership of the Senate or if he were a sole independent person in the Senate who had no right to have any political succession attributed to him, the practice is ill defined and demands the judgment of those responsible for its application. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* If the States concede their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to fill a casual vacancy they could refer that power to the Parliament of the Commonwealth and enable the Commonwealth, having got rid of section 15, to go on and add to the present truncated proportional representation provisions, those provisions that would enable casual vacancies to be filled in accordance with those principles by a transfer and a recount of votes.

* Having established incontrovertibly that, in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, the sole responsibility for filling this vacancy rests with the Houses of Parliament of the State, and commending a practice that has been established in the last 25 years, I suggest that in that respect I am seeking to uphold the Constitution scrupulously.

* Senator Withers  simply said that the States are being challenged and their rights are being encroached upon by many Acts of this Parliament, including a number of Acts whose <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity will come before the tribunal to which the ex-senator has been appointed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0)

* The purpose of our amendment was to make 2 statements- a statement as to who actually has the legal right to make the appointment, which cannot be quibbled at because it is a legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right, and a second statement on the procedure we believed States should follow when there is a casual vacancy in the Senate.

* It gives effect to the principle recommended by the all party Joint Parliamentary Committees on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1958 and 1959 that the terms of senators should be changed from fixed terms of 6 years, to 2 terms of the House of Representatives so that the elections for both Houses of our Parliament would take place simultaneously.

* Before the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committees recommended this reform there had only been 3 occasions on which an election had been held for one house alone- for the House of Representatives in 1929 and 1954 and for the Senate in 1953.

* The Prime Minister has since had discussions with the United Kingdom Prime Minister and it has been decided that the best course to resolve these issues is to reintroduce the Bill, and to give every opportunity for questions as to its validity to be raised in the High Court of Australia, in accordance with proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes.

* It is also clear that it will continue to deny him that possibility and that it will deny him access to the scalpel of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment whereas he still has access to what I would call the bludgeon of section 96 of the Constitution.

* What I would like to talk to the Senate about is the fact that the Labor Party has seen a second way of doing this, an indirect way which perhaps has got around the need for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments that it claims in its platform that it wants.

* If honourable senators look at the published documents of the Labor Party, and in particular to some of the addresses of its present leader and the present Prime Minister of Australia,  Mr Whitlam,  they will find a fairly clear indication of why the Labor Party finds the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements in Australia quite unsatisfactory.

* Although it has not put forward <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments which would achieve all the objectives which are set out in the platform, it has certainly put forward a series of amendments which go some of the way and which achieve some of those aims.

* I think it is a little strange that it took the ALP as long as it did to get on to the idea that section 96 could be used to solve the real problem that it has, namely, that the Australian people do not want it to change the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of Australia.

* I merely say at this stage that if I obtain leave to continue my remarks later I propose to deal with the actual figures which have been thrown up in the last 2 years' Budget Papers and which indicate that the use of section 96 has expanded enormously under this Government and has reduced the ability of State governments to carry out in any true fashion their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities.

* While noting that other motions considered at the meeting calling for stringent action are still the subject of a postal ballot, I ask: ( 1 ) Is the Minister aware of the strong objections of most Victorian solicitors to the development of a Government service under no statutory authority, operating beyond the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth and under no agreement or arrangement with other legal aid services which have operated effectively in this area for many years?

 Senator Scott also has to explain, as does  Senator Wood,  why such sinister interpretations were not placed upon a proposal such as we are advancing when the matter was considered back in 1958 and 1959 by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review.

* But even if the external affairs power were exclusive, and there is nothing in the Commonwealth Constitution to make it- so, relations between the United Kingdom and the States on matters that form pan of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of the States, such as the position of a State Governor or appeals to Her Majesty in Council, are clearly not external affairs.

* I would have thought that the Opposition would have shown its sincerity in its expressed desire to abolish appeals to the Privy Council if it had put its opposition to this measure more on the basis of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal power if it wanted to oppose, or if it had taken the alternative course of saying: 'We support this Bill because it achieves the result which we wish to be achieved.

* I rise with some hesitation to respond to him because I fear the man who commences his argument on a purely <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal matter, parading sincerity and finishing on sincerity, putting forward an argument which was hopelessly inadequate in the Labor conference in Launceston and expecting it to be effective here in the Senate; that is especially so when that exponent of sincerity went to London as a member of the 6-State delegation to argue the proposition that the Commonwealth was incompetent to request this legislation and that it was the prerogative of the States to say whether or not an appeal from the States' common law jurisdiction should be abolished.

* -I will return to the Deputy Premier and Attorney-General of Tasmania, who used the unique, unprecedented <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> occasion of unanimity on the part of the 6 States to impress London with the argument that it was the States and the States alone who had the authority under the Statute of Westminster to request an amendment to the right of citizens of the States to appeal to the Privy Council.

* With those guidelines, sincere people desiring to expose but not to expand the true <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limits would say: 'When Federation was established we established a High Court and a federal judiciary', which in relation to the next Bill to be debated by the Senate I shall try to demonstrate that the Government is seeking to confuse and condemn the country by exploitation 'but in the State sphere we maintained the Supreme Courts, the State judiciaries, the State Constitutions, the State powers and the State laws'.

* The only question for sincere people to consider on this occasion is whether we have guiding ourselves a sense of self discipline or an expansionist idea, as  Dr Cairns  had on ' Monday Conference ' last night, to fly by the seat of the pants on the last impulsive notion that comes to us on the basis that we are a self established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority.

* The text illustrates by various doctrines of finding in the Federal courts a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue, the doctrine of pre-emption which, as I understand it, means much the same as our occupying the same field for the purpose of a test under section 109 of the Constitution, by the references to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> causes and now the underwriting of criminal cases by human rights and, I might say, the undermining of the enforcement of criminal cases by this doctrine, the utter weakness and danger of the system.

* The result of that growth has been that, unless the number of High Court justices is increased, there is a serious risk that the volume of work in the original jurisdiction of the High Court will inhibit the Court's capacity to fulfil its principal role as an arbiter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions and as the nation's ultimate appellate court.

* Having regard to what Justices of the High Court have saidand all witnesses who gave evidence on this aspect generally concurred- it would appear that the Commonwealth has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate under its external affairs power to give effect to international obligations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* If they do so, it would mean that in significant and, possibly, expanding areas the Commonwealth heads of power would become more extensive than the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions expressly contemplate- and, consequentially, reduce the exclusive area of State authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* We assented some months ago to the first part of this Bill, which claimed for the Commonwealth sovereignty over this area in respect of minerals, whether oils or others, and we assented to that for the express purpose of enabling that intensely contentious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question to be decided by the only appropriate tribunal- the High Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* So, having given to the Government the right to test its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to mine for minerals in the off-shore zone, we are unwilling to apply to that off-shore zone- whereas to oil there is a co-operative arrangement with the States, each State administering its own designated area- an administrative patchwork, for other minerals in the same area, that has its origin in the genius of Connor to give directions on any subject notwithstanding the laws of the Australian Capital Territory purported to be applied to it and with the Minister having the right to delegate any of his powers to any officer of the Public Service.

* In rejection of that reply I make the point that of course there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations in relation to the direct intervention of the Commonwealth Government for those specific purposes.

* The Australian Government does not have complete <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to perform all housing functions, but it does have substantial powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0)

* All in all this is only a means of the Commonwealth exercising a power it has to overcome the many problems we have experienced in housing construction, particularly under the previous Government which made necessary such things as the undesirable homes savings grants, to overcome speculation in building which puts the price of land beyond the reach of home owners, and to bring about a situation where we have some orderly organisation in these fields over which the Australian Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power.

* If the honourable senator wants all the things that he has dredged up, including the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power question, to be considered by a select committee of this chamber, whose members will have primary and fundamental duties to this Senate and will have only the recess between the end of this autumn session and the commencement of the Budget session in which to hear mountains of evidence that will surely be a repetition of what has been said in the past, I suggest he is not genuine in his desire to see this legislation translated into law.

* Just as the last leader of the Liberal Party refused to assert his authority over  Mr Lewis  in New South Wales when he flouted a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention, so the present Leader of the Liberal Opposition has refused to exert his authority in an area which is properly the field of Commonwealth legislation without any interference from the interest of the States in legislative form.

* The question of licensing stock brokers in that fragmented field and the rules relating to prospectus and the rules relating to market securities in that fragmented State field surely would impel anybody to try to get together with the States to see whether or not by some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process an effective Bill, as far as possible beyond the range of foreseeable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge, should not be brought into Parliament for both the efficacy of the industry and its integrity.

* It may well be a good reference to send to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee to take evidence in the 6 States concerning the various Constitution and Electoral Acts and perhaps report back to the Senate as to a proper method of overcoming what I think is an injustice to members of State parliaments.

* How then, and under what <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> warrant, has this Commonwealth Government assumed the title, 'Australian Government', and imposed a series of ancillary titles denying the correct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Commonwealth title and status in the Australian federation?

* It was that reading which convinced me in the final analysis of the need to accept the consensus which exists in the Senate and that this matter should be taken out of the area of disputation amongst honourable senators and sent into an area where the Senate could be informed by the Court  of Disputed  Returns, the High Court of Australia, whether there exists the case in which  Senator Webster  had- and I believe unwittinglybreached the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements of section 44 and section 45.

* The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has not yet progressed to a stage of any formal recommendations and the States have not been receptive to the suggestion that local government bodies be represented on the Loan Council and the referendum to amend the Constitution has failed, chiefly I suppose, because its effect was misunderstood.

* Not for that reason but for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons the State Government insurance offices are not covered by the Insurance Acts or the Life Insurance Act and no one so far, to the best of my knowledge, has claimed that this gives them an unfair advantage.

* So the point is that the Government would be able to spend any part of this amount, which I have said is running at the rate of almost $600m, on any objective that the Government chooses, and it would not have to ask the Parliament for its approval or have parliamentary authority for it, nor would it have to have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for it.

* The first relates to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> justification which might have been offered for this legislation; the second is to consider whether laws of this character can be expected to have the overall beneficial effects which can be claimed for legislation which deals with racial discrimination; and the third is to specify a little more precisely why the Opposition will propose its type of enforcement in preference to that which the Government has suggested.

* I would be seeking some further detail in this context so that we may proceed in more detail with the examination of the statement that has been provided; but I felt that as an introduction to this discussion today we should put into context the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle, which has been upheld, of prior parliamentary approval for expenditure by government.

* The procedures which have been followed this year are no different from those which have been followed in the past, and I was glad to hear that principle corroborated by 2 members of the Opposition, one of whom was  Senator Guilfoyle,  who agreed when questioned in an interjection by  Senator McAuliffe  that the Government had not broken any legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions, although she said that it had broken the spirit of them.

* This would allow an expression of views from those people in the community who wish to express their interpretation of the legislation, from the people who have to work within the legislation and from the State governments which find great threats to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers which they wish to exercise in matters relating to transport within their own States.

* More particularly, perhaps, did the founding fathers look to the American institution, the Federal Inter-State Commission, which has operated with expanding authority in the Federation which was our parent so far as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure is concerned, namely, the United States of America from then to now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0)

* So, in our Constitution section 102 provided that there shall be an Inter-State Commission with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions and laws of trade and commerce.

* We are not in a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis in the sense that has been advocated and argued by Government senators or by Government supporters in another place, but we are in a crisis where the authority of the Parliament is being directly challenged by the Prime Minister who refuses to disclose to the Australian people the elements of corruption which involve him or some of his Ministers, whom he has acknowledged were involved in it in the last 12 months- since December 1973.

* I call as witness the Prime Minister of Australia and the documents relating to the double dissolution which were tabled in the Senate yesterday Honourable senators will find by persuasive reading that it is said repeatedly that because the Senate has declined to grant Supply the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice is that the Prime Minister must go to the Governor-General and seek a double dissolution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* A number of lawyers, academics and ordinary members of the public have expressed their views on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legality and/or propriety of what the Opposition is doing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* The view that I want to put to the Senate- it is a view that I expressed publicly in Queensland recently- is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric which clothes Australian society does not consist solely of the written Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* It consists also of the body of rules, precedents and practices which have been built up over a period of three-quarters of a century and which, in line with the development of the constitutions of other countries where those constitutions are not written, comprise just as important a part of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric as does the written Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* That is only half of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position that has to be met by an Opposition which will be judged in history as to whether it is acting with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* If that view is correct, then there can be no doubt whatsoever that the Opposition is behaving unconstitutionally in this situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* I do not say 'illegally' in the sense that court action could be taken against the Opposition or that in some way a judgment of a court could be obtained to the effect that what it is doing is constitutionally illegal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* But if 50 per cent of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric is the written Constitution and the other 50 per cent is that body of rules, practice and conventions that I assert it is, then the Opposition, on its own stance, stands convicted of having acted unconstitutionally in this matter and of persisting in acting unconstitutionally in this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* The second <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter to which I wish to refer is the assertion that was made by  Senator Rae  last week and repeated, although without detailed argument, by  Senator Carrick  this afternoon. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* In fact, when one looks at the message which was sent to the House of Representatives by the Senate and which is referred to in the amendment moved by the Opposition yesterday, one finds that the whole area of the powers of the Senate, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue and so on are canvassed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* I know that this has been said before but is it not the final proof that this argument is about politics, and to dress it up in whole lot of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> finery is simply a clever and so far fairly successful attempt to divert attention from the real political arguments on to a specious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue?

* The Prime Minister, with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> understanding, realised that the parliamentary system has to work and, as it was impossible for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to work with the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, introduced a new intermediary into the procedures of the Senate, namely the Manager of Government Business in the Senate.

* But I think, idealistically as  Senator Missen  spoke, that what he was suggesting to members of the Opposition as to what we could do about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems that face this country is stretching the credibility of his argument a little too far. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0)

* He was suggesting that perhaps in about six or nine months time issues such as the powers of the Governor-General, who at the moment seems to have the powers of an absolute monarchy, and the powers of the Senate, which at the moment is the most powerful House of Parliament in the world, and the problems created by these powers, which have been confirmed by the actions of the Governor-General in November and the elections since, can be discussed perhaps at a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention.

* No one on this side of the chamber or, I suggest, on that side of the chamber- not even  Senator Wright-  and certainly no one in the House of Representatives will suggest to me or to anyone else that, while John Malcolm Fraser is the Prime Minister of this country and we have a conservative regime such as that we have now, there will be any possibility of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment or even discussion of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment on this issue.

* It is not always that I agree with  Sir Eric  Willis, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, but I think he acknowledged the proper role of local government when speaking at a meeting of the Liberal Club at the University of New South Wales on 22 September 1976 when he said in essence that the role of local government should be defined by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment.

* I remind the Senate that when we raised the question at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, to which I was privileged to be a delegate, in Sydney in 1974 it was the very conservative representatives of the present Government as well as their counterparts in the States who were resisting any recognition of local government at all- firstly, at the Convention, and secondly, in any change in its relationship.

* Following recommendations of Estimates Committees in 1973 and 1974 the Senate referred the question of the 'ordinary annual services of the government' to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and that Committee considered and reported upon the subject It appears logical and sensible that matters arising from Estimates Committee deliberations should form the bases for such further Standing Committee examination, and the continuation of the practice warrants the consideration of the Senate.

* Those who have planned this exercise have taken the precaution of putting on notice the responsibilities that accrue to this chamber under the Standing Orders and under a contingent notice of motion that standing order 242 should be suspended in order to speed up the processes by which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amending Bill can be forced through the Senate.

* The Government, manifestly and I assume in conjunction with the Opposition, already has a scheme, that is, that no impediment is to be placed before this Senate, whose position is being placed in jeopardy in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense, by allowing the means by which the Senate can defend itself to be used.

* Honourable Senators might say that the public had an opportunity at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, but the ordinary public, the rank and file of the Australian community, did not have a chance even to be present at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention.

* My view is that when we are discussing matters that have been referred to us by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention it is fair to suggest that before substantive propositions are put before the Parliament, those propositions ought to be subjected to consideration by a subcommittee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention.

* The innocent abroad, the elector who is expected to cast an intelligent vote in relation to these matters and to differentiate between what he wants and what he does not want by way of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, would expect to find any provision in relation to casual vacancies in the Senate in a Bill entitled Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill 1977.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* The reality of this proposal is that when it is passed, if it is passed, the Senate will more truly reflect the people's wishes than it has even done before, except when as  Senator Wright  quite correctly pointed out in his dissenting view to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee of 1959, that up to that time there had been very few occasions when Senate elections and House of Representatives elections were held separately. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0)

* There will be no doubt about that because we believe in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, not just for its own sake but because of the experience of this Parliament and the experience which the government of Australia has had at the hands of the Senate.

* We may well be seeing a new era where <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations that have gone through the vetting of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention, come to the Parliament and then gone to the people will be treated by the people in a new way- not the way to be found in previous dealings with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment when fog, fears and so forth have overwhelmed them.

* Whilst I think there is general acceptance in the Parliament of what might be called the theoretical proposition of one vote one value, there must be a recognition that in the Australian Federation, with the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> entitlement to 5 seats and with the Territorial representation, the proposition of one man one vote in this community is mathematically impossible to achieve.

* Another fundamental reason why these referenda propositions, now contained in this Bill in particular, should be accepted is that, as I have already said, they have had the substantial endorsement of, and have been discussed at length by, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which has been meeting off and on over the last few years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* I feel therefore that it is terribly important that these proposals, which received the overwhelming endorsement of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last November, should succeed and show that we in Australia can go through a rational process of discussing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* Far from this being something which can be turned against politicians by saying that we do not want more of them so we should vote against the proposal, I think the Australian people will be ready to say that we have had over the years too many elections and too often and that situation will be solved by the proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* What is terribly important to us is that these referendum proposals are the first that emerged from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* But all the proposals were discussed and dealt with in that Convention and they are therefore the products of a rational consideration of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* Leaving that major argument which applies to every one of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments I turn to the matter of simultaneous elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* We know also that if we proceed without the acceptance of this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment we will have about 14 national elections between 1961 and 1981. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment in relation to simultaneous elections will ensure that elections for the 2 Houses are brought together, and we can have at such elections a full national debate on issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* I move from that question of the benefits involved to point out that the argument of constructive government which I present under this oil arrangement is one which has been debated before particularly by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959.

* I do not believe in the arguments which we have heard, which we will hear and which I have heard around the Senate already that somehow a government, under this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal, will rush to another election immediately after an election in order to bring out a hostile Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* For these reasons and trusting that the ideas of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions will meet with the favour of the Senate and the people, I support the Bill with all my heart. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0)

* The program provides, in any event, that after disposal of the first 2 Bills on the notice paper today, namely, the Customs Tariff Validation Bill and the Defence Force (Retirement and Death Benefits Amendments) Bill, the 4 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills will be disposed of not later than 5 p.m. tomorrow.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0)

* Let me say at once that in my opposition to this proposal in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, I made it plain- I circulated the text of my remarks to honourable senators 2 days ago- I have no objection to simultaneous elections as such; what I have objection to is using that rather superficially attractive expression to induce people to adopt a Bill, when the real effect of it ls to undermine the powers and give the go-by to section 57.

* Although 1 1 members of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee advocated a measure such as this in 1959- an advocacy from which I dissented- Menzies had sufficient prudence not to bring in a measure which would have undermined the Senate even at that stage.

* In speaking to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill- the one we are considering at present- I first wish to add strongly and emphatically opposition to the manner in which these Bills came before this House.

* In common with all other honourable senators I assume, my first intimation of the existence of these Bills was last Tuesday on an aircraft when I picked up a newspaper and read that these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills were to be brought in.

* However tainted the Government's motives might be in introducing this Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill- terms such as political expediency, deceit, cynicism and hypocrisy, among others, have been thrown around by members of the Liberal Party of Australia and in my view the motive is quite clearly and incontestably the desire of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to protect half of his senators from the wrath of the electorate 12 months hence- the Bill provides an opportunity for significant <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0)

* Whatever we may say about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and however many of us may like or dislike it, the fact is that the Federal Government, all State governments and local governments are represented on that body.

* As the Federal Government is really the only instrumentality that can implement the decisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention we have a responsibility to act on its behalf.

* Under the existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions it is possible theoretically for elections for both Houses of Parliament to be synchronised by holding elections for the House of Representatives whenever half Senate elections are due. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0)

* If the honourable member for Diamond Valley had cared I would have been only too prepared to have allowed him to have incorporated in  Hansard not  only those significant passages from the 1958 report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee but also the reservations that were expressed by  Senator Wright.

* I recognise, however, that the executive Government, the Opposition, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and the States believe that the proposition should go ahead. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0)

* But in relation to this Bill, we see a Liberal Government almost ambushing the Parliament and rushing the Bill through on the shallow pretext that it was considered and found to be necessary by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which okayed such reforms.

* If they had kept any record or paid any account to the proceedings of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, they would have been aware that as long ago as 28 October 1976 there was a recommendation from that Convention that this Bill, in the form it now holds, should be brought forward. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* If we all are to be men of absolute consistency it seems to me that we will never make progress with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change and reform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* In the past <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change has been a politically devisive issue in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* The whole concept of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has been to try to bring the warring parties together around the conference table so that they can agree on desirable changes to the Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* In the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which is now quite an old document I found a good explanation of why too many elections should not be held. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* I join with the majority view of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* I remind honourable senators that in 1974 this referendum was put forward before there was any talk of a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and before the States and the Commonwealth came together to try to devise solutions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* We put this forward as something which has come not just from this Government but from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which, I understand, has the support of every parliament in the Commonwealth and which has met seeking to bring us together to update the Constitution.

* He was speaking of  Mr Whitlam:   is moving step by step to remove first one and then the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objections hoping that the people will not see his real object until it is too late. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* The fact that the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention did not meet in 1974 is quite irrelevant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* There had been a recommendation as far back as 1958 by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review on the need for this legislation to be carried. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* The Government has brought forward this proposal for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform along with three other proposals that the Senate will be debating subsequently. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* The sovereign power comes from the people themselves and it will be the people themselves who will decide the fate of the proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change that are contained in this Bill and the other Bills in the package before the Senate, as they have done on other occasions when there have been proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* This proposal for a referendum concerning amendment of the Constitution arises out of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and the deliberations of that Convention at the end of October of last year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* A number of speakers in the debate have emphasised the need for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review and reform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* Indeed, the only real measures of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform that hitherto have been feasible have stemmed largely from the interpretations of the High Court of Australia, which, of course, is not subject to the will of the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* Therefore the movement for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform has been a most important one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which was established in 1973 and which proceeded through to the end of 1976, will continue to proceed because it was decided in 1976, as a result of progress made in Hobart, that it would meet again in Perth at the end of 1977, and there is every hope that it will do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* But if the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is to have any prospects for the future and any credibility with the people of Australia- the electors who ultimately will decide these matters- it must be seen to be having some practical effects and not simply to be a talking shop wherein the politicians of Australia gather from time to time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* That is the fundamental fact about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* In my view and in the view of the Government which I was expressing, the power of the Senate to which I am utterly devoted and which I will always support will reside, firstly, in that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee of equal representation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* The point,  Mr Minister,  is that when we bring in those shortened terms for honourable senators which coincide entirely with the terms of honourable members of the House of Representatives, when we remember one 's experience here from 1975 or such a brief period as that or remember the whimsical reaction of  Mr Whitlam,  when we rely upon <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> experience throughout the democratic world in the last 25 years and when we remember the quotations which were given by  Senator Martin  and myself - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-2)

* Has the Minister considered the recommendation of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which reported in 1959 unanimously in favour of legislation to give the Commonwealth power over corporations, untrammelled by the limitations in the present Commonwealth power, which would enable a uniform companies Act and Federal legislation effectively controlling the securities industry?

* Can the Minister representing the Attorney-General inform the chamber of the progress of the 2 consumer protection ordinances for the Australian Capital Territory, the Manufacturers Warranties Ordinance and the Misrepresentation Ordinance, on which the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs reported to the Senate in December 1976?

* To synchronise the elections so that they would both take place on the one day-to compel that course of action by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, would be to weaken the effectiveness of the Senate because there would be a tendency for the Senate and the Senate's interests to be submerged .

* In looking at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, to be most generous, approximately 1600 words were spoken in relation to the whole of the matter, other than the question of casual vacancies and the question of who should issue the writs.

* Both <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> writers and practice indicate that there is no real limit upon that man's judgment to require a dissolution of the House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34)

* That indicates a fundamental lack of appreciation of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> safeguard of section 57 which provides that if the House of Representatives sends to the Senate a Bill which fails to pass and after an interval of 3 months the Bill comes again from the House of Representatives and we again fail to pass it, then, and then only, there may be a dissolution of the Senate, accompanied by a simultaneous dissolution of the House of Representatives.

* Yet the only conclusion one can reach is that when the matter came on at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, by some strange form of osmosis there was a transmutation between the thoughts of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and National Country Party and there was no necessity for any debate whatever even to explain to anybody- for anybody even to raise a question- about all the things that had been put up in the preceding 3 years.

* Like  Senator Wright,  I do not claim to be an expert on either the affairs of Aborigines or the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems of this country, but there are various aspects of the legislation and the manner in which it has been handled and brought to this Parliament which disturb me. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

 Senator Wright raised considerable doubts and objections to the legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects of the Bill, something which is beyond my capacity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* Therefore, I speak on behalf of the Government when I say that it would expect that after the third reading a Government senator would move that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for urgent investigation and consideration of many of the matters that have been raised, as well as any others which it saw fit to raise, and then report back to the Senate.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* There is the question of the true effect of this legislation not from the point of view of any legalistic or technical <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> contentions, all of which I disclaimed last night, but in accordance with proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principlenot specific <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* I pointed out to  Senator Gietzelt  and the Opposition that if we were to accept his amendments, in particular those in relation to reserves which seek to freeze the status of the land, they could raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties and invite a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change which could set aside the whole of the Bill now under consideration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* Minister must approve by-laws, and the application of by-laws to non-Aborigines, I am advised, could raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* I referred earlier when speaking on this clause to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt that would be created about a Bill of this kind if it were to provide for people other than Aborigines and Islanders. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* The advice that the Government has is that it could raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt and a provision of this kind should not be believed necessary simply for the reasons expressed by  Senator Gietzelt. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* I would have to say that the real difficulty that the Government finds in accepting an amendment to remove sub-clause (9) is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt which it would raise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* Clearly the fact that the Government acknowledges that the matter needs to be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is indicative of the existence within the legislation of certain deficiencies which need to receive further consideration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* There could be some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt about this matter and the second proposed sub-clause is unnecessary since the Aboriginal rights are already protected under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* So I am aware of the work of a number of committees, and particularly of the Committee to which I have asked that this matter be referred- the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Minister submitted that there was some legal doubt and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems associated with the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* Of course, the motion moved by  Senator Bonner,  which is under consideration, states that we should look at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, comprehensive and consistent effectiveness of this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* Is it not an indictment upon us and an indictment upon the framers of the notice of motion- I am referring to those who have the responsibility of preparing the notice of motionthat on the same day that we passed it, when it was part of our responsibility to review the legislation and make the essential remedies, if there were defects in it, notice was given of a motion to set up a committee of the Senate to study it, to see whether it is effective, to see whether it is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and to see whether it is comprehensive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* There is no doubt that the States have certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and certain capacities to be difficult. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* Most of  Senator Gietzelt's  contention is centred around the fact that we want to send a Bill off to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Bill was sent off to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which recommended 120 amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* So that was the first point of great pressure and urgency on the Federal Government, to move to legislate to enable it to act on its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in respect of those people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* There is some argument, I understand, about whether a select committee ought to be set up to look at the Bill or whether it would be better to send the Bill to a standing committee such as the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* There is no ideal standing committee to which this matter could go except the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee which does have some natural advantages in that it has a secretariat and members who are used to looking at <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and examining them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* So anybody from the Senate who is not a member of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee but who does have a keen interest in the subject can of course go along and participate in the proceedings of the Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* It is clear that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee ought to take a close look at a very wide range of Queensland legislation to ascertain just how many pieces of legislation could possibly affect the welfare of Aborigines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* The reference of this matter to a committee will in no way limit the rights of and opportunities for people to put submissions to the Committee and to say whatever they believe is relevant, particularly under paragraph (c) of the motion in respect of the constitutionality, comprehensiveness, consistency and effectiveness of the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* Indeed, it is even open to the Queensland Government, if it sees fit, and to any department under that Government, to put in submissions relating to the legislation and to say what they think about the constitutionality and so on of the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* It will be interesting to see whether they treat the Senate committee with that son of interest and respect and choose to put to the Parliament and to the Government via the Senate Committee their views on whether or not that legislation is really <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and properly consistent with the responsibilities of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has already stated publicly that if the proposed legislation and the lease arrangements which will be legislated for by the Queensland Government are not satisfactory to the Commonwealth, the Commonweatlh will use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of acquisition in order to ensure that the rights and interests of the people of the two communities are fully protected.

* But if he moved a motion- he is indicating by nodding his head that he would do so if it were not for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> restrictions- requesting additional funds for this road, it would become quite clear that what we were asking for, if the motion were accepted, was an additional allocation in the Budget; in other words, either for a greater Budget deficit or for the imposition of more taxation.

* I rise not to speak on any policy issue underlying this Bill but on a matter which I submit is equally appropriate for a house of review to contemplate- the question of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of this Bill if it is enacted in its present form. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-74-0)

* I make the further point that there is no basic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitation on the Commonwealth's ability to impose whatever rate of taxation it likes on packaging as such but there are some very real <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations on the form of presentation in which that legislation can be brought forward. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-74-0)

* It may well be, and I am putting the point quite strongly to the Minister, that this legislation will be unconstitutional in its present form, and, even worse, will throw into doubt the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the whole Customs Act if it can be perceived to impose a duty of taxation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-74-0)

* The Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, having read a speech that I made in this chamber last week, today brought down a recommendation which would suggest that the Parliament is not competent to make a logical decision unless it has someone looking over its shoulder and guiding it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0)

* I have come to the conclusion that if a recommendation were brought down concerning an alteration to an Act- whether it be done by me, by some legal member of the House or by the committee that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee may desire to establish- the relevant Minister in this chamber would be unable, under this Government, to accept it, even when it is pointed out that the Act is wrong. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0)

* It is not the function of that Committee to perform that particular role and, indeed, that is the reason why the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, in its report which was tabled today in this Parliament, recommended very strongly the case for the establishment of a further joint committee of this Parliament to scrutinise Bills for various deficiencies of exactly the kind that  Senator Cavanagh  has drawn our attention to tonight. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0)

* The most that any committee could do if a matter like this were referred to it and the most that a joint committee could do, if one of the kind that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee has recommended were already established, would simply be to report back to this chamber the deficiencies in the legislation in question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0)

* Their interest in the development of the Territory and the aspirations of its people have been evidenced by successive enactments of the Commonwealth Parliament which have brought this Assembly to its present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status, and we accept this generous gift as a further earnest of their continuing concern.

* According to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs the Federal Government has the power to acquire the land, but it has done nothing about it, even though the Commission was prepared to make the highest bid for the property.

* I do not do so for any narrow, legalistic or pedantic purpose but because I consider it crucial to policy, and in any case <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, to make it clear that the Federal Parliament is not abandoning its total ability to determine what shall or shall not be offences beyond the low water mark and the manner in which they are to be determined and disposed of. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0)

* The other important point to be made- I do appreciate that honourable senators who have spoken recognised this- is that this measure is the first in what I hope will be a series of Bills to be considered and passed by this Parliament over the next 12 months or more to give effect to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement reached at the last two Premiers conferences regarding the control of the offshore areas of Australia as a result of the decision of the High Court in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0)

* The fact is that the basis of that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement is that the Commonwealth is recognising the traditional exercise of jurisdiction by the States in the territorial sea adjacent to their coasts.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0)

* We have sought reference of this matter to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs because it is plainly the most appropriate Committee to deal with such a matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0)

* I think that Committee is busy because there is a much greater interest now in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in Australia than there has been in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0)

* Of course, a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change would be necessary to introduce this power in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0)

* I think it is fair to say that the Australian Labor Party, both in opposition and in government, has always taken the view that the High Court should not be snowed under with original jurisdiction but should be the true pinnacle of the court system in Australia, an appellate court, a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> court, and a court which deals with intergovernmental disputes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The objective of the Bill is to make the necessary detailed jurisdictional changes in order to complete the achievement of what the Government describes as a coordinated structure of Federal and State courts in Australia- a system in which the High Court is freed of a good deal of its previous original and appellate jurisdiction in order to be able to concentrate its scarce resources and efforts on appellate matters of major significance; a system in which the new Federal Court is vested with both appellate and original jurisdiction in a variety of matters, including the whole jurisdiction of the previous Bankruptcy and industrial courts and appellate jurisdiction from the Territory Supreme Courts; and thirdly, a system in which the State and Territory Supreme Courts become the primary trial courts in their respective areas with the State courts exercising in addition a more significant role than hitherto in the application of federal law- for example, in tax and industrial property questions and also to some extent in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> litigation at first instance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* At the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which took place in Perth last year this question was again the subject of a major debate which culminated in a resolution expressing, quite surprisingly to many delegates and observers in prospect, quite overwhelming support for the concept of the creation by agreement of a single Australian court system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* Another major and very familiar problem area is of course that of family law, where, as is quite well known, the High Court has held in the case of Russell and Russell that there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> inhibitions on the Federal Family Court being able to deal with the full range of matters that can arise in matrimonial and particularly child custody cases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* Certainly the family law type situation could, as the honourable senator indicates, be solved by the State governments being much more willing than they hitherto have been to refer to the Commonwealth under the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision in section 51(xxxvii), the exercise of legislative power in respect of certain presently exclusive State matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* The restraining role, if it is to be performed at all, must fall largely on the upper House; and this Senate, because of its powerful <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, is better placed than any other second chamber in the Westminster system to perform this role. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0)

* Admittedly we have special <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements that force us to bring in two Bills on certain money matters which in other parliaments would be covered in a single Bill; but such Bills have a minor effect on the total and in no way explain why we pass three times as many Acts as Canada and twice as many as Britain, particularly as the British Parliament combines the functions of our Federal and State parliaments.

* We of the Australian Democrats have not yet balloted it specifically because we have not got round to it, but I would be very surprised if our organisation and our people who are thinking about this area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal reform did not go along sufficiently with  Senator Hamer  almost to be induced to send him a membership form for the Australian Democrats.

* The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system which is created by this Bill is a nineteenth century one- great stuff for the heyday of the British Empire, but not the kind of thing that is in any way appropriate to the latter part of the twentieth century, which is a time when colonies are just a little bit out of fashion, and rightly so.

* The key things to appreciate about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system which is created by this Bill are as follows: First of all, it confers minimal powers on the elected Legislative Assembly; secondly, it confers negligible powers on the appointed Executive Council; thirdly, it gives quite excessive powers to the Australian Government appointed administrator; and, fourthly, it enables the retention by the Australian Government, acting through the Governor-General, as the Bill puts it, of quite excessive residual powers.

* It is the view of the Opposition that the earlier correspondence made available to this Senate convincingly demonstrates that there were issues other than the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one and that  Senator Webster  had indeed misled the Senate on 3 May.

* A point that I think I made in my earlier address to the Senate is that various Ministers are responsible for various attitudes and actions, which they must responsibly have in relation to this particular area of Queensland:  Mr Anthony,  from his standpoint as Minister for Trade and Resources;  Mr Newman  in his position as Minister for National Development; and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in his interest in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters arising out of a Premiers Conference.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2)

* It may well be that some element of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> discussion with the Queensland Government has had some effect in holding up the proclamation of that Park, but  Senator Webster  comes here and says that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue is the only issue that is holding up the proclamation.

* Mr President,  I believe that what  Senator Webster  has said, the documents that have been produced and the arguments that have been given in this chamber on previous occasions clearly establish that  Senator Webster,  in answering those questions and giving the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal reason as the only reason why there was delay in the proclamation of this National Park, was quite justified and certainly was entirely honest and entirely consistent with his credibility as a Minister.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0)

* I think that the changing nature of Commonwealth-State relationships reflected in the education sector is one of the factors that we have to bear in mind in discussions of the Commonwealth's role of providing the money, as it does in the schools sector, without having much of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to see that the money is spent according to its own priorities that it may consider important. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0)

* What I am saying in this debate on education, which deals with the provision of money to schools, is that I made the point earlier that the Commonwealth has a very limited <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> capacity to direct the money it provides to the States for schools assistance into the areas which appear to be the areas of considerably greatest need.

* If that is so, I invite the Government to have a look at its performance in the area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in relation to Aborigines, and its performance in relation to the Queensland Government on that issue.

* I take this opportunity to make clear- I hoped that I had made it clear in the debate in the Senate some time ago- that whatever relationship is settled upon between the States and the Commonwealth- and this includes marine parks generally and the activities of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in relation to the territorial sea of Queensland- as to the respective exercise of jurisdiction, the Commonwealth Parliament will at all times retain the full <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, legal power, to exercise its ultimate will and control in relation to the matter of marine parks or, indeed, anything else.

* The only reason that Bishop Muzorewa was able to become the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe was that there was an agreement whereby the white population of Rhodesia- a group with which I have never had any identification; nor have I expressed any great admiration for it; nor indeed have I spoken of it in the past in this place, I would have thought, in other than condemnatory terms- agreed, for the sake of peace, to enter into a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangement whereby it forfeited majority rule to the black population but retained certain powers for the time being under a constitution which was subject to amendment.

* The position is that the first meeting of the ministerial council associated with the Great Barrier Reef is to be held on 4 October, and that has nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements which, on my understanding, have been basically put aside as a matter that is basically firmed up between the Federal Government and Queensland.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0)

* Certainly, one expects to find a Bill which is in harmony with basic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles which respect the impartiality and integrity of the conciliation and arbitration process and which make it quite independent of the government.

* As I said earlier, a highly respected Australian, a former  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Sir Richard  Kirby, who was the  president  of the Commission for 17 years, was reported in the Melbourne  Age  of 22 September last as saying that the legislation stopping the Commission from acting in certain ways was probably invalid and would be liable to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0)

* The implementation of a provision of this kind would represent a clear shift from the operation of this legislation, and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision on which it is founded, as being directed to the conciliation and arbitration of individual cases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* I regard it as incompatible with the whole <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it has evolved over the last 70 or 80 years, for the position of individual commissioners to be forced into that particular mould in the way which the Government is intending. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* A provision of this kind in the Act will not stand any kind of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge to its validity- a point that was made very vigorously by  Sir Richard  Kirby, a point that has been denied ever since with equal vigour but with a great deal of wrongheadedness by the Government spokesmen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* That is exactly why  Sir Richard  Kirby said that it was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> piece of nonsense and that is exactly why the Attorney-General should hang his head in shame that he should have the folly to bring in such a childishly incompetent piece of legislative drafting containing a provision of that kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* If one turns from what one would say is the very dubious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objection which has been raised to the problem of the actual operation of this provision, one will be concerned with the fact that there are objections from commissioners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* I put this not on the basis of any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objection but on the basis that it does seem to lead to some lack of confidence in the commissioners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* I cannot see how that power fits into conciliation or arbitration, bearing in mind what was said by  Sir Robert  Garran about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations and the fact that it must be a power in respect of the settlement of disputes and not just a wide open power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* I know also that there is power in the High Court to 'read down' powers, as happened in regard to the Family Law Act, so that they fit within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework and so that they can operate without defeating the law.

* The operation of this supposedly co-operative and consultative committee of the nation's Attorneys-General was the subject of some very stringent criticism by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in its recent report on reforming the law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-43)

* It is well established that, as a matter of Federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, persons can continue to be regarded as immigrants if they are born overseas and have come here from overseas, even after they have been naturalised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0)

* It may well be that there is on the present case law a point at which a person becomes a member of the community or becomes absorbed into the community- as the judges have put it- so that at that point the person ceases to be an immigrant for the purposes of the reach of Federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0)

* So, one still can have a situation where someone has been in Australia for just three years, applies immediately for naturalisation and, I am suggesting, can be construed as the law now stands as an immigrant for the purposes of federal statute law and for the purposes of the reach of federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, and as such be then liable to the impact of these particular sections.

* That the Archives Bill 1978 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible, in so far as the Bill relates to issues common to, or related to, the inquiry into the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* In view of the terms of this resolution, the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs concentrated its Archives inquiry on Part V of the Archives Bill relating to Commonwealth records with particular emphasis on access to those records. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0)

* We have therefore invited the public accounts committees of State parliaments to consider holding complementary inquiries as State authorities have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for the administration of tertiary institutions, including accountability for the distribution of funds to those institutions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#debate-46)

* That petition took into account the inquiry which had been made by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which indicated that the operation of the Commonwealth legislation could be defeated by the sort of action which was taken by the Queensland Government in March or April of 1978 to abolish the reserves to which the legislation might be applied. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0)

* Is the Minister aware also of the conclusions of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in 1975 following its investigation into national compensation, which were based on substantial evidence from a number of expert witnesses and which indicated that accident prevention could be influenced by economic incentives such as differential premiums which encourage positive safety programs? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0)

* As far as the attitude of the Government is concerned, it agrees that this is an area which needs attention, but occupational safety and health is primarily the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0)

* But experience so far surely should have persuaded the Government, and certainly persuaded  Mr Bailey,  as the Government's main adviser in this area, that cooperative federalism, here as elsewhere, is destined to be an abject failure, and that there is no prospect of getting effective, inegrated acrosstheboard machinery unless the Commonwealth itself takes the initiative and exercises that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power which it almost certainly in my belief at least has available to it under the external affairs power, and enacts its own human rights legislation.

* This course of action is partly as a  reult  of severe <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question marks over the Federal Government's powers to legislate to protect and enforce human rights as well as the Government's belief that the guaranteeing of these rights does not require a Bill of Rights and the accompanying judicial powers of enforcement, believing instead that the present law adequately protects these rights and that Parliament is the more  appropriate  body to ensure the continued protection of these rights.
