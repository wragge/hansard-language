* I believe that <span class="highlight">men</span> with industrial and commercial experience should be included in the Arbitration Commission because they would examine the effect of their decisions on the economy of the country as a whole and would not have regard only to the simple act of adjusting wages in according with the cost of living, particularly having regard to the fact that one important section of the community is left right out of calculations and cannot share in the cutting up of the cake.

* If the Government is of the opinion that it would be too expensive to commence work on constructing passenger cars there immediately  it  could place orders for their construction with the Islington workshops in South Australia, which are the most efficient workshops in Australia and which have specialist  staff  with many years experience in this sort of manufacturing work.

* He said that he chaired the meeting in his capacity as a union  president  or union secretary and not as  president  of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party; yet he owes his position in the Victorian Labor Party to the self same unions because a ticket is put up before every State Council meeting of the Victorian Labor Party and that ticket is selected not by the rank and file of the Australian Labor Party, diminishing as it is with so many expulsions, but by a group of unionists and within that group of unionists are <span class="highlight">men</span> who owe their position to the control which is exercised by the Communists.

* Whilst  Senator Young  and  Senator Prowse,  representing the Liberal Party on the one hand and the Country Party on the other, certainly this evening have quoted figure after figure, statistic after statistic and percentage after percentage in respect of the Government's general economic and rural policy, so far as wheat is concerned we say it is about time that the Government stopped looking only at figures, statistics and percentages and came down to the real and pressing problems of the man on the land, the small grower, his wife and family and those who live in rural areas, who rely on the stability of the wheat industry for their livelihood and economic security.

* In view of the great loss to the Department and the specialised space tracking project which would occur if these <span class="highlight">men</span> were retrenched, will the Minister cause these retrenchment notices to be withdrawn until some employment in the Commonwealth service is found at equivalent pay rates and service conditions to ensure, firstly, that they will have continuity of employment and.

* If these young <span class="highlight">men</span> are forced to tight in a futile conflict while life in Australia goes on as usual, why will not the Government at least give them  a  chance to re-establish themselves adequately if and when they are returned from Vietnam. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-35-0)

* But now when they in turn are asking for their just entitlements they are told that their applications for war service homes finance are being put into cold storage for the time being - indeed, for an indefinite period, as I will show later. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* This is happening not because they have been in any way remiss in their applications but because the Government has underestimated - and considerably underestimated - the demand for war service homes, particularly as regards finance to purchase existing dwellings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* Although the Government underestimated initially it is apparently not prepared to do anything about the matter by way of immediately making more money available lo the War Service Homes Division to cope with the outstanding applications. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* This trend towards an extended waiting period that has again developed with war service homes applications, and the Government's cavalier couldn't care less' attitude, are deserving of condemnation by this Parliament and the Australian people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* A mere $4m or $5m should immediately be made available by this Government for the housing needs of ex-servicemen, particularly young <span class="highlight">men</span> who have gallantly served their country in Vietnam at the dictation of this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* I suggest that if $4m or $5m was required as a subsidy for some big business enterprise then this Government would be jumping because certainly the whips would be cracking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* But so far as the Government is concerned, these young <span class="highlight">men</span> and their wives who have waited for a home for so long can just wait a little longer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* That is obviously the attitude of the Government and it is to be very loudly and hotly condemned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* A great deal has been made of <span class="highlight">men</span> returning from Vietnam; but, as I understand the position, the reasons for this unusual demand are not clearly known. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* With a history of an 8% reduction in applications over a period of 5 years, I think the Department was quite justified in believing that the demand would not increase. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* Therefore I do not believe that it is fair or reasonable to criticise the Department or the Government for not being able to judge accurately this increased demand, which has arisen not because of one reason, as we are led to believe, but because of a number of reasons, some of which are unknown. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* The fact is that there are very few conscripts in Vietnam in comparison to enlisted <span class="highlight">men</span> who are volunteers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* Now we find that ex-servicemen who are eligible, acceptable and who comply with all of the other conditions laid down for war service homes finance have to wait for finance for a period of up to 6 months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* Previously, reference was made to the fact that these <span class="highlight">men</span> are being made the bunnies of the inflationary squeeze that is being imposed on people, unjustly, because so many other sectors of the community are escaping their responsibilities.

* According to the Auditor-General's report, an amount of $50m was made available for war service homes in the last financial year, and repayments of principal and interest on war service loans amounted to $72,395,398. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* When  Senator Greenwood  was searching his own mind and trying to find an excuse for the policy which the Government is pursuing, surely he could have suggested that Treasury could make an amount available from this money which is going into Consolidated Revenue, which is the difference between the amount of $72m for the repayment of principal and interest on war service homes finance in the last financial year and the amount of $50m which was provided for war service homes finance in the last financial year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* The facts are that there has not been the upsurge in the number of applications from returned servicemen from Vietnam and the other theatres of overseas active service as there was after the Second World War. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* 1 go along with  Senator Little  and  Senator Greenwood  who said that the reason for this is that these servicemen are young <span class="highlight">men</span> who are coming back from war service and who have not yet decided how, where and when they want to purchase a home. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* We are living in an affluent society and many <span class="highlight">men</span> - not only those who served in the Second World War but others who are eligible for war service homes - have decided that they will give up renting a house or a flat or living in a house that they have inherited or brought under some other plan, and, because their savings are greater in the affluent society, take advantage of the increased amount available to them, still on the same generous terms, to purchase the home in which they want to live in what are becoming the later stages of their lives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* No government could be accused of lack of foresight in not being able to assess that in 1969-70 there would be an increase in the number of people who fought in a war which ended in 1945 and who would desire to take advantage of a loan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* This also has been a very good part of Government policy because if there is one industry that does an amazing amount of good for the economy and gets <span class="highlight">men</span> employed it is the building industry, the housing industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* Once a contract to build a home is let the axe and saw start working in the forest and every branch of industry that has to provide the wherewithal to complete a furnished home is put into action, and so the money flows through and this helps the employment of many people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* The second choice in priorities for war service homes under all shades of government has been the purchase of an existing home. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* There is another factor which 1 believe is quite important when one comes to consider  Senator Little's  suggestion that a special supplementary grant should be made now to the War Service Homes Division to allow the purchase of existing homes by successful applicants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0)

* But I realise, and anyone who has any common sense and knows business in this country or any other today, realises that if people selling homes that were wanted and being waited for by ex-servicemen eligible for war service home loans knew that $2m or more was to be pumped into the home buying economy between now and the end of July, up would go the price of homes.

* I do not want to sidetrack myself, but the American practice of interviewing ambassadors and putting them before the public immediately they return has involved the American people to a tremendous degree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0)

* On 14th May it was reported in the Sydney 'Daily Telegraph' that  Dr Forbes,  the Minister for Health, had told a meeting of the Government Parties that the Government could not get any agreement with the medical profession as a whole and that it should now - I emphasise the word 'now' - consider the position of patients and the public.

* Although we of the Opposition intend to move a considerable number of amendments at the Committee stage of the debate, we do not oppose the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* We take that course only because the Bill represents an improvement of the existing costly, wasteful and anomalous national health scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* It eases from the shoulders of wealthy people their share of responsibility for the health of the Australian community and a heavier burden is consequently placed on the shoulders of the poor people or <span class="highlight">men</span> supporting large families. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* The policy of the Government at that time was one of laissez-faire - leave well alone - as was instanced in an answer given to me by the Minister for Health about 2 years ago when I asked about the purchase of a private aircraft, at a cost of about $40,000, by a large health insurance fund operating in New South Wales. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* I have been impressed by the large amount of evidence that has been placed before me that this Bill, if implemented as it stands, may have very serious effects upon a very important section of the medical profession, that is, the general practitioners who, I am informed, constitute 40% of the medical profession in this country and who, if I am to judge from the number of them who have got in touch with me individually and in a representative capacity to protest against the Bill, regard its provisions as seriously threatening their future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* I believe that there is abundant evidence of the truth of their claim that if the Bill is passed as it stands it will discourage young medical <span class="highlight">men</span> from undertaking one of the most important duties in the community, the duty of the general practitioner.

* It has happened there, as it has happened here, that sections of the medical profession - as  Senator McClelland  said - would prefer to have no health insurance funds at all than to have greater government supervision.

* Perhaps  Senator Turnbull,  in his tolerance, might sometimes think that they are the servants of a parsimonious government  and  that, when there  are  restrictions on the prescribing of pharmaceutical benefits, economy might dictate their actions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* 1 believe that the Government might well give consideration to the idea  of  sending out to practitioners a short note giving the reason why a drug is taken off the list, particularly when a drug is taken off the list and the members of the Committee realise, as they must realise, that the average practitioner thinks that that drug is of value to his individual patients. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0)

* We got support from  Senator Gair  in that regard, lt appeared to me that  he  came into this debate because he felt that he was one of the guilty <span class="highlight">men</span> to whom the amendment is addressed seeing that he had offended in this regard when he was the leader of a State government.

* We need on the Commission <span class="highlight">men</span> who have been proved in trade and commerce because the wool industry is Australia's biggest business and I do not think that growers, with perhaps odd exceptions, are sufficiently qualified to run a Commission of the magnitude and importance of the proposed body.

* I hope that the original members who are appointed to the Commission are <span class="highlight">men</span> of responsibility and trust - 1 believe they will be - but there have been instances in the past where people who have been appointed to positions of authority, responsibility and trust have fallen by the wayside.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0)

* If for this reason members can be removed by the Minister after they have failed to attend 3 meetings, we will very soon run out of qualified <span class="highlight">men</span> to appoint to the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0)

* I ask the honourable senator: If there were a meeting of 5 members consisting of the  Chairman,  a government representative, a representative from industry and 2 special appointees, does be think that the  deputy  of an appointee on that day could do something wrong and could involve the Commission in the expenditure of some substantial sum of money?

* Because there were such <span class="highlight">men</span> in our community we amended the National Service Act so that where it comes to the knowledge - or some other word with which I disagreed at the time - of the Department of Labour and National Service that there may be a conscientious objection, the Minister can set up the procedure for establishing the existence of a conscientious objection, even where there is no application by the person.

* When the Senate adopted the recommendation of the Committee as regards punishment, it adopted it in those precise terms; that those  2  gentleman be called to the Bar and reprimanded. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57)

 Senator Byrne, as a lawyer, should know that the common law doctrine of natural justice must cede to express provisions in a statute, even if the Parliament were to be regarded as a court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57)

* It is only necessary to mention these things,  Mr President,  to point out the hopeless confusion into which  Senator Byrne  has fallen in an attempt to equate this Parliament with a court of law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57)

* If we overlook the pettifogging, hair splitting approach which  Senator Byrne  has adopted in neglect of the Constitution and in a confused equation of a court of law with the Parliament of the land, let us have a look at what was done to these <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57)

* In case  Senator Gair  thinks that they have suffered any gross personality damage or that their futures have been put in jeopardy by the way they have been dealt with, I can assure him that when the procedures were finished I accompanied one of the journalists,  Mr Richard  Walsh, who happens to be a long term personal friend of mine, to the refreshment room in this building and had a cup of coffee with him.

* In fact the only voice that was raised as these <span class="highlight">men</span> were leaving the chamber was that of the eloquent  Senator Gair  whose contributions tonight have been the usual neanderthal grunts that we get from him when his slumbers are disturbed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57)

* I was not sure whether or not he had a case but I thought that if any senator felt the way he did about the manner in which this Senate - not the Privileges Committee - had acted in the circumstances in imposing sentences upon these <span class="highlight">men</span>, in spite of what  Senator Willesee  says to the effect that it should not have come before the Senate, I believe most strongly this matter should have been brought before the Senate again.

* Whether  Senator Byrne  is right or wrong, it most certainly should have come before the Senate at this time if we accept the case presented by  Senator Willesee  that we are endeavouring to establish our own rules of law and to give to the public at least a knowledge of the privileges that this Parliament has to protect itself under its laws.

* When that was taking place, these <span class="highlight">men</span> did not have the right or the privilege of being represented by counsel, or even of raising their voices to say that there were mitigating circumstances as a result of which the severity of the sentence should be reduced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0)

* It is all very fine to push up costs, to make unreasonable demands, to have payments made far beyond the measure of production in this country and in that way cause inflation, and then say 'Look, the Government is not doing anything about it; it is responsible'.

* Does the Minister see any real difference
              between the alleged conduct of those 2 <span class="highlight">men</span> and that of respectable broker firms and
              others in the short selling operations in connection with shares in Antimony Nickel,

* If members
            of the Waterside Workers Federation withdrew their labour in support of a friend, a mate
            or a co-worker then I believe that that union was only carrying out its traditional role
            - a role which has ever been the role of the trade union movement wherever injustice has

* The
            sciences to which most of us looked to help mankind, might well bring destruction in

            of its fighting <span class="highlight">men</span> in two world wars and by the vigour and skill of its leaders

* The staggering size of the national Budget indicates the rapid rate of

* I am sure all honourable senators will agree with me when I
            say that I regret that there are problems presently facing rural industries, but I find,
            looking through the Budget, that the Government has recognised these and has provided
            for them by including payments to rural industries amounting to at least $275m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4)

* Having lived and worked in the

* If one has not an
            overpowering desire to be loved or even respected by one's fellow <span class="highlight">men</span>, an interest
            or life in the law and politics is one of great satisfaction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4)

            satisfaction I will receive by pursuing that profession in the national Parliament will

* The Commonwealth might well
            consider setting up a national development advisory council to draw upon the great

            part in the development which already has taken place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4)

* The Commonwealth might well consider, too, setting up a national
            development fund into which an allocation of money could be made each year by the
            Budget. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4)

* Honourable senators may be aware that this building is patrolled at night by 2 nightwatchmen who are on the staff of the Joint House Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0)

* Some few weeks ago it was established that one of these <span class="highlight">men</span>, without specific authority, had adopted the practice of stationing himself at the front door during the night instead of patrolling the building. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0)

* The housekeeper who is in charge of the nightwatchmen was informed that no changes in the duties of his staff should have been made without the approval of the Secretary of the Department and that, before such approval would be given, some evidence to justify the need for an officer to be posted at the front entrance all night would need to be produced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0)

* Unfortunately, however, it seems that the officer concerned misunderstood his instruction in asking for the names of persons he could not personally identify, which led to the incident which  Senator Poyser  mentioned in the question he addressed to me a few minutes ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0)

* All I can say about his speech is that I hope that the departments to which he referred will read, mark, learn and inwardly digest what he said. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3)

* I believe that one of the reasons, if not the only real reason, why we prepare our speeches and are upstanding here is because we know that the speeches are read by officers of the Public Service who decide whether any action will be taken and, if action is to be taken, what action can be taken on any worthwhile suggestions that might flow from the members of the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3)

* It is also of benefit to the public because it is imperative that as this Senate really develops itself and becomes something of note in the parliamentary life of this country the calibre and ability of its senators should be maintained and, if possible, increased. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3)

* I say this to remind us that on 30th June last we lost some record breakers from this Senate - some <span class="highlight">men</span> and women whose names will live forever in the annals of the parliamentary history of this nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3)

* I refer, first of all, to our former  President, Senator Sir Alister  McMullin, and the 2 lady senators,  Senator Dame  Annabelle Rankin and  Senator Dame  Ivy Wedgwood, both of whom broke records in many ways during their membership of this Parliament.

* The Country Party always seems to be able to provide us with amiable and capable <span class="highlight">men</span> to fill the position of  Chairman  of Committees, and it has done it again. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3)

* The other main basis upon which  1  believe most people speak against capital punishment is religious grounds. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0)

* There are, within our society, many people who hold the view that capital punishment should be abolished and refer to biblical quotations to indicate how sacred life is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0)

* In more recent times the correctional systems stress reform and the discoveries of the behavioural sciences are being utilised so that the penal institutions will tend to turn out better <span class="highlight">men</span> than they receive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0)

* I suggest this as a point for contemplation by those who would see that, instead of carrying out capital punishment in the case of a heinous crime, the offender should be incarcerated for the term of his natural life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0)

* On the points made as to the reasons for opposing capital punishment, I remind the Senate that the existence of capital punishment is an anachronistic retention of the concept of punishment which has been replaced by the concept of reform.

* This was manifested by the last  speaker, Senator Milliner,  who suggested that small business <span class="highlight">men</span> in the country towns of Queensland, because of the recession in the primary industries, would be benefited by tax concessions.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0)

* But 1 believe that, even along the lines  I  have suggested and in accordance with the prediction of  Mr Jess,  we can confidently expect that with an increase in the rates of pay, as recommended by the Kerr Committee, it will be possible to obtain, and in a reasonably short period of time, a strength in the armed forces which is the same or roughly the same as that which the Minister suggested in his second reading speech was sufficient in the present circumstances, that is, 40,000 <span class="highlight">men</span>.

* The only thing wrong with it, I feel, is that we should be in a position to do more in training young <span class="highlight">men</span> for the defence of their native land or the land of their adoption. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* We do not want a repetition of what happened at the time of the Second World War when young <span class="highlight">men</span> of the age of 18 years - not 20 years - were called up and, with very little training, were sent, as nephews of mine were, to Milne Bay or the Kokoda Trail. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* As  Senator Carrick  said earlier in the debate, they were less equipped to defend themselves and their fellow <span class="highlight">men</span> than they would have been if they had had adequate training.

* Give young <span class="highlight">men</span> something in which they can interest themselves and they will go along with it, but to call them to a parade on a Saturday afternoon and march them around 2 or 3 times, leaving them then to sit down and engage in pebble throwing at one another, when they would rather be playing football or cricket, is not good enough.

* For the benefit of those who blow into the Labor movement with any little bit of wind that blows, I point out that the Australian Labor Party was not known as an organisation until 1918. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* In 1911, 3 years before the outbreak of the First World War, when Australia was fully protected by the military and naval might of the British Empire, the Fisher Labor Government - Fisher was a Queensland representative and a good Scot - implemented a scheme of universal and compulsory military training. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* This 1911 Labor scheme embraced not only <span class="highlight">men</span> of 20 years, not only young <span class="highlight">men</span> of 18 years; it embraced all those who were between the ages of 12 and 26 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* I would not, but I can imagine the hue and cry of the present Australian Labor Party if the Australian Government today proposed to extend the operation of our national service training scheme to boys in Form I. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* Fisher recognised the necessity of training and discipline, and he knew that even if they were never needed for war it would at least do them no harm, that they would grow up to be bigger and better <span class="highlight">men</span> for what they learnt and for the training they had received. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* So when we go back through the history of Labor and Labor governments we see that we are now, at a time when the world was never more disturbed, dealing with this proposal with less enthusiasm than they had back in 1911.

* Another aspect of national service training which has been completely overlooked, and which I suggest is vital to the defence of Australia, is that this scheme builds up a substantial force of reserve troops who are fully trained and who are available at a moment's notice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* At the moment, I think, about 21,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> have been fully trained. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* I wonder, as the Australian Labor Party has placed such great faith in an expert such as Professor Howard, what faith it would place in its expert advisers - the <span class="highlight">men</span> who are trained to advise a government on what type of forces are required? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* I am in a very jovial and generous frame of mind and I will accept just for the moment accept that fact because the honourable senator felt that he could assist Labor supporters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* What would the Labor Party do with the advice of its expert and military adviser if the departmental advisers on defence said:  'Mr Minister,  we require an army of 50,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> to be available'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* Would he just ignore such a recommendation? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* During the second reading speech the Minister for Works  (Senator Wright)  put forward some of the important aspects of the Government's view in relation to this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* the Government continues to stress the importance of volunteers as the basis of our Armed Forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* However, if Australia's defence manpower requirements cannot be met by volunteers, any government would invite condemnation of its policies if it were to refuse to require <span class="highlight">men</span> to serve, for this would entail dependence on an army of inadequate strength. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* No responsible government could act in this manner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* If 1 hold an independent view that there is a threat in the north and that it is important that not only is it necessary to have a voluntary force but also to require national service by young <span class="highlight">men</span> of our country, then I think I can hold to that view. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* If one investigates the propositions put forward by the Opposition as amendments to the National Service Bill one must agree that the first move it wishes to make is to eliminate national service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* The other important matter which it wishes to see implemented by amendment of the Act is the provision of a means of avoiding national service if a conscientious belief can be found. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* A most interesting document was put forward by  Senator James  McClelland in relation to this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* I do not know whether honourable senators on the Government side have taken time to study it, but a basis is put forward whereby if a person whose conscientious beliefs do not allow him to engage in military service either generally or while particular circumstances exist, so long as he holds those views he is exempt from liability to render service under the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0)

* We do notice a feeling developing in this country that for too long you have carried the burdens of defence and of economic development of the free world, and that you attribute some of your current domestic problems to this and that you should carry degrees of commitment and call on others to carry a greater share of the burden. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* 1 mention this simply in this context that since 1939 Australia has had its troops overseas continuously and over 50 per cent of that time they have have been in active combat. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* Europe, the Pacific, occupation of Japan, at the time of the blockade in Berlin, our planes in the Berlin airlift, troubles with NATO, our troops in Matta, Korea, the Malaysian terrorists where we were with the British and assisting Malaysia, the time of the confrontation in Indonesia where our troops were fighting and in Sabah and Sarawak, and finally in South Vietnam with you and at the present time our planes are in Butterworth in Malaysia and our ships and our <span class="highlight">men</span> are in Singapore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* On this question of national service I think  Senator Carrick  made a tremendous impression upon the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* He analysed the principles of compulsory military service with great advantage to those whose understanding yearns with anxiety on the question of compelling <span class="highlight">men</span> to serve for defence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* He established the equity of a system of compulsory military service when the defence force requirement is only a percentage of one age group. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* That argument was not answered in any way by those propositions of  Senator Cant  who quite properly, as I see the position, drew our attention to the fact that all members of the CMF are under the obligation, upon proclamation of a state of national emergency, to serve wherever the Government requires, in active combat if need be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* That is an obligation which at that stage of national emergency can extend not merely to national servicemen then recruited but to any <span class="highlight">men</span> of whatever age in the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* When those figures are examined it must be admitted that Australia's establishment of 40,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> could not, with real responsibility, be reduced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* I am totally unable to understand how the Australian Labor Party can build any argument upon what some people in that Party call a lottery. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* The simple fact is that out of a great number of young <span class="highlight">men</span> who are available for national service only few are chosen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* How could one establish any fairer means than the birthday ballot - a secret choice of selection by reference to, not their class, their creed, their education, their income or any other distinction that might cause invidiousness, but their birth irrespective of all the other things that divide <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* 1 regret as much as does anyone in the House the fact that casualties, some of them fatal, have been suffered by some national servicemen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* I compare that number with the number of fatal casualties sustained by national servicemen in Vietnam. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* Some 437 Australian servicemen, 234 of whom were members of the permanent forces and 202 of whom were national servicemen, have met their death in Vietnam. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* To emphasise the situation I repeat that 596 of those registered for national service met their death in civilian life whereas 202 national servicemen met their death while on military service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* With the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard a table showing that 643,039 young <span class="highlight">men</span> registered for national service to 30th June 1971 and that 51,279 were called up and enlisted in the Army. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0)

* I also pointed to the fact that to suggest that we are any more adequately protected by having 40,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> than 28,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> is sheer fantasy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* I pointed out also that no serious attempt had been made by this Government to make the volunteer system workable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* I referred to the prospects of increased recruitment in the wake of the improved pay and conditions recomended by the Kerr Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* I cited in support of this proposition the statement of a well known and not very radical supporter of the Government in another place, the honourable member for La Trobe,  Mr Jess. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* I referred to the hypocrisy of the Government in being unwilling to admit that now that the Vietnam commitment is drawing to a close any justification which ever did exist for conscription has ceased to exist. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* Perhaps this is the reason why the Government considers it necessary to maintain conscription. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* But, of course, once more Government supporters are out of step with their ex-leader who, in one of his memorable contributions to the journalism of this country, pointed out that in his defence policy he did not want Australia's young <span class="highlight">men</span> dying in jungles and swamps because of possible Balkan-like quarrels which he felt were the responsibility of the local government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* I now come to the most glaring misconception, to put it no higher than that, of  Senator Carrick  when he suggested that honourable senators on this side of the House and all of those who have opposed conscription and the involvement in Vietnam over the recent years have been living some sort of a lie by suggesting that <span class="highlight">men</span> who are subject to the draft are subject also to being involved in a war overseas in which they do not believe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* There has been plenty of opportunity since then for the pundits on the Government ride, including  Senator Sim,  to show that this was false. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* In 1964, because of the possibility of having to fight in Vietnam and because we were fighting in Malaysia, it was necessary to have a strength of some 30,000 <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* With no possibility of any dispute arising at present and, according to the previous Prime Minister, with no visible possibility of an invasion of Australia or of a necessity to defend Australia in the next 10 years, it is apparently necessary to have a strength of 40,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> in the defence forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* If we had adopted the advice of military experts in 1964 we could have today, by way of normal recruiting methods, sufficient servicemen from whom we could get 5 years' service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* The Government is sacrificing Australia's defence by following a useless system of training <span class="highlight">men</span> at a colossal cost to the nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* With the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam it may be thought that this amendment is largely academic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* We also look to the fact that the end of our commitment  in Vietnam does not - on the indications that we have not only in this debate but also from our experience of this Government - exclude the possibility that we may be quickly embroiled in another war. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* A government which could, behind the backs of the people, with no formal declaration of war and with a total absence of moral, political or military justification embroil us in the Vietnam tragedy might well decide with the moral flexibility for which it is notorious to involve us in a war with, for instance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* Though I loathe apartheid 1 could defend their right to object to being conscripted for a war in South Africa just as I object to our young <span class="highlight">men</span> being conscripted into a war in Vietnam. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* I nm not saying that because a certain group of Catholic clergy or laity puts forward an argument  Senator Greenwood  or anyone else is bound to support it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* But I would suggest that arguments as serious as those which have been put forward seriously tonight by  Senator James  McClelland should be given more serious consideration by the Attorney-General than merely his usual performance of insulting members of the Australian Labor Party, impugning their motives, impugning their patriotism and attacking <span class="highlight">men</span> who are in gaol. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* Senator Wheeldon  quoted the Catholic laity and said that <span class="highlight">men</span> should not fight in an unjust war or in wars to which they object. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* Senator Wheeldon  probably believes in that view and is probably closer than arm's length to the comment made by  Senator James  McClelland, who, during his speech tonight, admitted that the whole ambit of change to the National Service Act was contained in the Labor Party amendments and finally said: Yes, if we were the Government we would have to gaol an individual such as that.' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* As time is going by and as we are anxious to complete the Bill tonight I will explain briefly the purport of the amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* For example if a magistrate sentenced a man to 5 years imprisonment he may set a minimum non-parole period of 4 years which is, in effect, a way of shortening the sentence, subject to certain conditions imposed by the Commonwealth Prisoners Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* We believe that <span class="highlight">men</span> convicted of an offence against this Act are in no sense to be considered more criminal than people of the type that I have named who have the benefit of this non-parole period. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* That is the purpose of our amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* At present section 51c of the principal Act, which is sought to be repealed by the amendment, has the effect of excluding section 4 of the Commonwealth Prisoners Act from operating in respect of the sentencing of <span class="highlight">men</span> convicted of failure to report for or to render national service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* It also precludes the operation of the parole arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* In short, as I understand it - and  Senator James  McClelland put it neatly - what is designed by this amendment is to enable a parole provision to be inserted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* The Government opposes that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* In addition to the basic reasons which the Government has, there are a number of considerations which have escaped the Opposition's attention or to which it is not prepared to give any consideration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* The basic reason why the Government opposes this amendment is that it is clearly essential that <span class="highlight">men</span> imprisoned because of breaches which they have committed against the National Service Act should, as far as practicable, be subject to a uniform period of civil imprisonment in the different States in which they are committed to custody. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* To provide for parole arrangements would introduce a situation of unnecessary and potentially inequitable variations in the periods of imprisonment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* The effect of the amendment would be to enable courts in New South Wales. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to fix a non-parole period or a minimum period of imprisonment to be served by a prisoner before becoming eligible for release on parole. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* In some States, therefore, a national service defaulter would serve only a very short non-parole period, but in the other States the full term of imprisonment would have to be served. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* Therefore there would be an inequality in provisions for punishment for national service defaulters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* The effect of the amendment would be to attempt to give the State parole boards the power to release a national service defaulter serving a nonparole period in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* We submit that it would be unsatisfactory for the administration of the Commonwealth criminal law to have a situation in which 4 States had the power to release a Commonwealth prisoner before the expiration of the full term of imprisonment, that power being vested in a State board.

* As I understand the position, the United States authorities do not take any action against young <span class="highlight">men</span> who have fulfilled the normal call up requirements in Australia and who can produce a discharge paper. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* But when those young <span class="highlight">men</span> who have registered but were not called up go to the United States there is some confusion as to whether they are there on a temporary visa. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* I will quote one case in a moment or I will give the details to the Minister after this debate has concluded. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44)

* If the Government is of the opinion that it is not possible to make an increase in the donation because of the economic depression now being experienced in Australia, will the Minister take the necessary action to set up the machinery for an appeal to the Australian people in an endeavour to raise at least $10m for this very worthy cause?

* It is because the Government does not want to debate its failed policy on Vietnam - a policy which has failed completely;  a  policy which has left this Government without one shred of credibility;  a  policy which has dishonoured this country; a policy which has led to the death of nearly 500 Australians; a policy which has led to the death of countless Vietnamese; a policy which has inflicted misery on some of our neighbours in South East Asia; a policy which has rendered fatuous, futile and utterly unworthy of serious consideration the arguments put by the Government over the past 6 years as to why we should be sending young <span class="highlight">men</span> to die or to be maimed in Vietnam.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96)

* Looking back over the figures that  Senator Cavanagh  has given, I would say that a reasonable conclusion might be that the Government is embarrassed by the Act which it has inflicted upon young <span class="highlight">men</span> and is embarrassed by the tremendous task that faces the authorities in imposing the provisions of that Act on many thousands of young <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96)

* I have the feeling that the person who now, after a series of changes, holds the office of AttorneyGeneral is a person who is determined to impose the law against thoi-e who resist the Act and who is determined to treat these young <span class="highlight">men</span> as criminals in breach of an Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96)

* As this offence carries the penalty of 1 8 months' imprisonment - the period of imprisonment once was 2 years - one would have thought that the offence was an indictable one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96)

* The Attorney-General has never properly considered, nor does he understand, the position of young <span class="highlight">men</span> who are strongly opposed to the selective type of conscription which has been imposed upon them by this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96)

* Our case is this: It has been asserted in the newspapers and it has been asserted by us in this House that in 5 years 1 1,000 young <span class="highlight">men</span> who have failed to register for national service and who have no legal reason for not registering have not been prosecuted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-96-0)

* If he looks back at the record to be found in Hansard he will have to admit that he and every other Government spokesman has evaded the question that we asked and which we ask again for the final time: Is it a fact or is it not a fact that 11,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> who have evaded national service have not been prosecuted? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-96-0)

* He uses it to engage in a blackguardly attack on a man who cannot defend himself in the same way as he used this office to engage in blackguardly attacks on young <span class="highlight">men</span> throughout Australia who have had the courage of their convictions in refusing to go to Vietnam, while  Senator Greenwood  and his colleagues of military age have shown their lack of courage by not going to fight in the war in Vietnam to which they have been sending these young <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-96-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-25-0)

* We believe that, along with this expression of gratitude to those young <span class="highlight">men</span> who have served in Vietnam, the Senate should express - members of the Opposition want to express this, whatever the rest of the Senate might wish to do - its disapproval of what the Liberal and Country Parties have done in this military intervention, and also should express its opinion that those who have been maimed or injured as a result of their war service, and their dependants, should be given repatriation entitlements that will compensate them adequately for their sacrifices.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#debate-59)

* One wonders at the state of frenzy into which the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  worked himself because the Leader of the Opposition stated clearly that we consider the sacrifice these <span class="highlight">men</span> made was a sacrifice that ought not to have been asked of them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#debate-59)

* Let it be known clearly by the Government that if the Opposition's advice had been supported in the early stages of this war these <span class="highlight">men</span> would not have been killed, injured or maimed and it would not have been necessary for this Senate to place on record its sympathy to the relatives of those <span class="highlight">men</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#debate-59)

* We have 3 major contractors in this country, namely, the Government Aircraft Factories, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and Hawker De Havilland Australia Pty Ltd. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

 Senator Bishop spoke of retrenchments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Recently we had the situation where the Government, through its policy of continually endeavouring to stabilise the work load in the industry, directed certain defence projects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* From information supplied to mc I find that 10 mechanical tradesmen and 6 electrical tradesmen were issued with retrenchment notices as late as 7th April of this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Retrenchment notices were issued also to 6 electrical tradesmen at the Fishermen's Bend plant, but a review of the situation enabled those latter notices to be withdrawn. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* This review also brought to light the fact that the management could offer employment at Fishermen's Bend to 8 of the 10 mechanical tradesmen under notice of retrenchment at Avalon. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* The fifth was found upon interview to be unsuitable for the work available and the remaining 3 <span class="highlight">men</span> declined the offer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* In this financial year, 1971-72, the value of the work load for the industry for the 3 main organisations which I have mentioned exceeded $40m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* The Opposition's doubts about the future of the industry are not reflected in the confidence held by the Government and by the industry in respect of works capitalisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* When we look at this situation we must remember, for example, that the value of Commonwealth owned land, buildings, services and plant used in this industry amounts to about $24m while privately owned investment in the same categories totals a further $16m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* This amounts to a total capital investment in the industry of well over $40m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Obviously, in time of war and during periods of reequipment by the Services the industry booms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* So we have a situation in which some <span class="highlight">men</span> have to be stood down. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* I think if we examine this whole matter properly we will find that one of the major reasons why the Services have not as yet placed any orders for the aircraft is that there is an internal battle being waged within the Service departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Perhaps the battle is not in relation to their requirements, because I understand that the Army would be happy with this type of aircraft, but it is in relation to whether the Royal Australian Air Force or the Army will fly it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* By the time the Government takes any action the world markets will not be open to us because we will have been beaten to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* I have spoken to the top <span class="highlight">men</span> we have in the industry and they have shown grave concern about the fact that we may be beaten to the markets of the world with an aircraft which they believe will be readily saleable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Yet today the Minister states that although the 2 prototypes of this aircraft have been tested and found satisfactory, the Government has not yet committed itself to production of the aircraft. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* Why are skilled <span class="highlight">men</span> dispersed through frustration because the Government in this, as in everything else, takes a long while to make up its mind? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* I think anyone who has considered the record of the 'Ikara' and 'Turana' missiles and realises the intense interest that has been shown overseas in these weapons can only come to the conclusion that we are very fortunate to have in our aircraft industry <span class="highlight">men</span> who are capable of developing those weapons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* I feel that the Government is being too slow in making up its mind about this project and as a result is inducing a feeling of frustration in the minds of many of the expert personnel and this could well lead to their leaving the industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1)

* If there is an answer, it may be that we are wrong in opposing this proposed new section, but up to now the Government has not been able to give an answer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37)

* The Government will now have a situation in which it can stand down <span class="highlight">men</span> under this proposed new section and also impose a penalty under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37)

* In the basic course 12 scholarships will be provided tenable for 12 months, open in general to young <span class="highlight">men</span> and women from any part of Australia, who have passed the higher school certificate or its equivalent and who show evidence of being likely to profit from the training provided.

* It is very interesting to go back  100  or  120  years only and read in the Hansards of Great Britain the speeches that were made by members of the legislature of that country when propositions were before the Parliament to relieve the dreadful industrial conditions that had developed out of the first attempts at modern-type industrial produtcion, with no recourse to the legality of controlling wages and conditions in the industrial enterprises.

* They revealed that of the trade unionists in this country 38 per cent voted for the Liberal and Country Parties and 41 per cent of their wives voted in a similar fashion, which may mean that women are more intelligent than <span class="highlight">men</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56)

* As other speakers on this side have pointed out, serious and all as it may be, the time lost through strikes - half a day per man per year - is a drop in the ocean compared to the loss in production due to industrial accidents and due to the unnecessary time and production lost through the Governmentinduced unemployment which has plagued this country during the last year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56)

* If one thinks in terms of 60,000 <span class="highlight">men</span> unnecessarily out of work over a period of a year and the production lost during that time one does not give a great deal of thought to the half day per man per year which is lost in strikes.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56)

* In the face of this situation we find in the legislation before us an attempt to put the clock back, as I have said, on the matter of machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes and in the matter of sanctions which the Government seeks to have at its disposal to enforce its will on working <span class="highlight">men</span> seeking wage justice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56)

* That was the award in which the Commission attempted to say that the minimum wage would be the maximum wage by inviting employers to absorb over-award payments they had been making up till then in the rises that had then been given.

* It is said that <span class="highlight">men</span> go on strike - and I heard this echoed again last night by none other than the pundit from Tasmania,  Senator Lillico  - because of some wicked <span class="highlight">men</span> up there in the union office who call them out on strike. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56)

* I believe that this matter of strike ballots alone indicates either the total unreality of the Government's thinking, as instanced by the remarks of  Senator Lillico  last night, or its total cynicism. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56)

* When the unions come forward and say that the Government should arrange for the contract to be given to an Australian company in order to gain that employment potential, which, as I say, would give employment to about 250 <span class="highlight">men</span> for some two or three years I believe, the first thing we must take note of is that, if the Government does not do so, they simply would destroy the opportunity of working on the construction of the pipeline.

* I do not want to go too much into the fact that they were rejected from the scheme in 1965 and 1966 but what I am asking in this case is that priority be given under the existing scheme to ex-servicemen from Vietnam and those in the permanent Army before these dispossessed blocks are put on the open market if there are no applications from persons qualified by reason of service in the First or Second World War. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* There is no great difficulty, as I see it, in the Government adding to the Act a provision to give this priority to those ex-servicemen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* There is no great problem in amending the existing Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* The Commonwealth does not ignore young <span class="highlight">men</span> who have completed national service and who have had previous farming experience. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* Many former national servicemen have asked me how they should apply for assistance, and no doubt every other senator has had similar experience. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* The honourable senator can rest assured that, if there was a bigger intake of national servicemen and a corresponding demand by national servicemen with rural experience for farms or further assistance, the responsible Minister would be aware of this and no doubt would examine the situation and, if necessary, would make recommendations to the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* But on present indications there are only 30 to 40 such ex-servicemen in the whole of Australia in any one year and this number is not likely to become greater, as the national service intake has fallen in recent years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* I am not asking for an overall scheme; all I am asking for is that a provision be written into the Act to give ex-servicemen from Vietnam or <span class="highlight">men</span> who have served in the permanent forces priority to available blocks before they are thrown on the open market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* I accept that, but I cannot understand why the Government is not prepared to make some provision for priority to be given to these ex-servicemen before a block is put on the open market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* I point out that most of the ex-servicemen settlers in the up-river districts of South Australia are First World War settlers and therefore are about 70 years of age. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* The Government should at least make it possible for them to apply instead of rejecting them with the blanket statement that they are not eligible and that, if there are no applications by qualified <span class="highlight">men</span> who served in either the First World War or the Second World War, the block must be offered on the open market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* Then, if the departmental officers believed they could not make a go of it, I think most of them would be satisfied; but they are very unsatisfied that their applications have not even been considered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50)

* The Minister made the statement that one of the reasons why the Postmaster-General's Department is not attractive is the continual industrial turmoil which exists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0)

* In effect it was an accusation that a public department cannot carry on its normal function in the normal way because of the activities of the trade union movement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0)

* I believe that  Mr Saker  was appointed wholly and solely on his very excellent record in the trade union movement and because at that time not only the Liberal State Government but also people in the working class movement had confidence in his ability to carry out the duties of that position in the manner in which he has carried them out for more than 10 years.

* I refer to that because there seems to be no solution to the problem of giving first aid treatment or ambulance attendance to isolated workers, particularly in the Commonwealth Railways. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-40)

* But consideration might be given to an association between the Royal Flying Doc tor Service and the Commonwealth Railways in relation to lines the locations of which do not afford proper first aid facilities when <span class="highlight">men</span> cannot be trained in first aid.

* Let me test these statements: Has the ALP said, whether in the Barnard version, the Willesee version or the caucus version, that it has looked at this base, that it is a threat to Australia, that it does not involve a question of dialogue with the United States or any other nation, that it must be removed from Australia because it is a threat to Australia or that it is an aggressive, dangerous war machine? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0)

* The Bill, which continues to provide some recognition of the service that these <span class="highlight">men</span> gave, is complementary to the Repatriation Bill in that it applies the same important improvements in war pension rates and conditions of eligibility to be provided under that Bill to the corresponding provisions of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act.

* In my view the Department - acting, I believe, on advice from a higher level - was attempting to bludgeon these workers back, to starve them to the point where they had to go back and to agree to the terms of employment, which were unacceptable to them, that were being offered by the employer.

* The position with regard to the franchise in the 6 States of Australia is as follows: South Australia and Western Australia have enacted legislation to reduce the voting age to 18 years; New South Wales passed legislation in 1970 lowering the franchise age to 18 years but the Act has not yet been proclaimed; in Victoria a Bill to lower the franchise age has been passed by the lower House and is likely to become law shortly, thus enabling the 18 to 20 year olds to enrol in time to vote at the State elections which, 1 understand, are expected to be held about the middle of this year; the Queensland Cabinet approved the lowering of the franchise age to 18 years but the Government deferred consideration pending information as to the Commonwealth Government's intentions; in Tasmania a Bill which included the lowering of the franchise age was passed by the Lower House of the last Parliament.

* Undoubtedly the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  was able to say that the actions that he and the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Barnard)  took were purely in line with the Labor Party's election promises and, as has been emphasised on many occasions, that the Labor Government had a mandate to take just those actions.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66)

* For  Senator Murphy's  benefit, I state that in 4 compartments or in 40 items of one bill the taxing master is unrestricted as to the detail to which he shall submit the legal fees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66)

* Therefore, I put this forward with considerable concern as a Queensland senator who has been through these engineering works, who has spoken to the operatives, who knows the people employed in them, who knows how important it is that their volume of work should be maintained and who knows the dedication of the <span class="highlight">men</span> who have built the industry and the very low labour turnover in the enterprise concerned.

* As we consider this measure an essential one in our program to improve service conditions we feel as a matter of equity that it should also be extended to those national servicemen serving at 6th December 1972 who voluntarily chose to complete the period of service for which they were originally enlisted.

* We are going to have to live with the man in the hood for a long time: certainly until the present generation of terrorists, the Black September <span class="highlight">men</span> and the Provos and the rest, has expended itself in death or defeat; and very likely longer than that, until the force that drives such <span class="highlight">men</span>, the calculation that such methods can bring them what they want, has been disproved by repeated failure, and they have no more imitators.

* They said that the real danger - a danger which, with respect, the Government has not understood - is that there is in the community at any time a fringe of people who are neurotics, who are on the border of being psychotics, who are inadequate and who have a great feeling of inadequacy, of depression melancholia and who want, for once in their lives, to do something to get their names in lights.

* As to murder, where the law requires the death penalty, we have a most widely accepted situation whereby it is still a matter of mercy for the Crown - being interpreted that means the Attorney-General who is the highest law officer in the State - with a proper assimilation of the purposes of punishment and the degrees of punishment to review all the facts, not merely the admissible evidence against the accused but all the facts that are brought together on a file, and to make a recommendation to a responsible group of <span class="highlight">men</span> who are the Cabinet of the day.

* Does the Australian Government and the Attorney-General, who is singularly inattentive, not regard seriously the fact that the Yugoslav Government falsely represented to the Australian Government the circumstances of the arerst and ultimate death of 3 Australian citizens? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0)

* I remind the Senate that the Yugoslav Government let it be known to the Australian Government that these 3 <span class="highlight">men</span> were killed in active combat in what is called the Bosnian incident.

* Later, because of circumstances, a statement has been forced that this was not so at all and that these <span class="highlight">men</span> who were apparently arrested under various circumstances in June last year were tried in a secret military court, had a secret appeal and, subsequently, were executed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0)

* If a responsible government were told on the one hand that people were executed by being shot in the field, in the heat and blood of conflict, that is one thing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0)

* If, 9 months later, they are told that that is not true, that the Government has had them in gaol and has just executed them, should we not then query the whole situation and ask ourselves: Do we have any satisfactory proof at all that these <span class="highlight">men</span> committed the offences which they are alleged to have committed? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0)

* This was what upset the metabolism of the Government - not the lives of the survivors of 3 decent Australians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0)

* I remind this Senate that statements have already been made that at least one of those 3 <span class="highlight">men</span> who was executed - Vlasnovic, whose widow and children live in Geelong, Victoria - never at any time had active association with Croat political activities in any organisation of violence, and did not go to Croatia under any circumstances of incursion but went for the innocent intent of visiting his parents. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0)

* Honourable senators on this side of the Senate will assume that these 3 <span class="highlight">men</span> and others were innocent until we have it proved to us that the situation was otherwise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0)

* If there is any lesson to be learned at all from the events of this evening it is that <span class="highlight">men</span> of goodwill on the other side of the chamber have to start asserting themselves to ensure that there are normal relationships of the type which were evident in this place under the previous Government, the type which enabled the Opposition over the last two or three years that I have been a  Senator here  to defeat the Government from time to time but at the same time enabled the Government of the day to carry forward its legislative program.

* Although this theory is completely contrary to other evidence which I have and which the Government has, which suggests that 10th April was the actual execution date, because of the remote possibility of saving the lives of innocent <span class="highlight">men</span> will the Government take immediate action to check the facts of the execution, the Yugoslav Government already having given 3 different dates of execution or death?

* I cannot really ask honourable senators to try to imagine that they are old age pensioners - old women and old <span class="highlight">men</span> living on their own - but if they were, would they not want a doctor to call to see them?

* So the doctors wrote to the DirectorGeneral of Health Services and asked that the after hours locum services - the emergency services - be given an extra amount of these doctor's bag drugs which is a reasonable request, lt should not take much effort for two or three <span class="highlight">men</span> - departmental officers and doctors - to get together and work out some scheme under which there will not be any cheating of the Government or drug addiction of the doctor.

* It is being gradually recognised that the threats that are being engendered, aided by the most modern methods and mechanisms that man has devised including the development of instruments of violence and opportunities for man under the influence of stimulants to commit violence are such that a Parliament that today persistently proceeds, just because of an ideological idea that it has a conviction that there should be no capital punishment, is, I believe, blind completely to the destructive threats that are evident in our community.

* With all this before our eyes - a growing tendency towards organised crime, terrorism and prison riots - it is a humiliating moment for the Senate that it should be constituting a majority that will precede with the breaking down of these safeguards and the depriving of prison officers and policemen of that to which they are entitled, that is, the deterrent of the possibility of a capital punishment penalty being imposed upon anybody who takes the life of a prison officer or policeman.

* -The Opposition supports this Bill, as it would support any measure that contributed to improved conditions of service and improved welfare for our servicemen, although I seriously doubt, if the Government pursues its defence policy as outlined in the Budget, that there will be many servicemen left in Australia's forces to benefit from these rehabilitation decisions.

* It might well be thought strange that we in the Australian Parliament seek to do something which could result in freedom for a man who gave the Soviet its most powerful weapon; and yet Sakharov has indicated clearly in his statements from behind the Iron Curtain that he is disgusted with Soviet society and the way in which it controls <span class="highlight">men</span>'s minds, and for that reason I have no hesitation in bracketing him with Solzhenitsyn in the resolution which is before this chamber.

* I do not know whether everybody will agree with me, but I feel that there is a very good reason for delaying the publication of that report, and that is so the Australian Labor Party can claim credit for improvements in the repatriation scheme which were brought to light through the publicity of the media at public hearings of that Committee.

* It is all very well for the government of the day to say: 'Our advisers say it will be 10 to 15 years before there is any forseeable threat to this nation '. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* So the Government has no idea what will happen in 3 or 4 years and whether it will require armed Ser1 vices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* But we must keep the top officerstrained <span class="highlight">men</span>- and we must keep moving into the armed forces new, modern weapons at a fairly regular rate so that the pipeline of munitions production and maintenance people is maintained. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I suppose the reason for that is that the urgency motion which has been put to the Senate is based upon 3 assumptions- that there is a decline in the morale of members of the armed Services at present, and this is based upon a number of factors which were outlined to us at the commencement of the debate; that we have somehow got offside or will get offside with our allies; and there is a threat to the security of this nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* This Government has been highly critical and insulting about South Africa, but we who know our nation's history remember that South Africans fought side by side and bravely with our <span class="highlight">men</span> in 2 world wars, and those who may be blind in their ideology and criticism of a country that they know little about should remember that the naval base at Simonstown, the ports of Cape Town and Durban and the sea routes around the Cape will be of great importance to Australia and its allies should our defence Services ever be called upon to defend this country.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* To use one of the Government's own phrases, it is time that the people of Australia woke up to the fact that because of the actions of this Government, particularly of the Minister for Defence in regard to what is happening with our armed forces, the morale is low and the <span class="highlight">men</span> are wondering what will happen to them next. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* The main argument produced by the Government to substantiate its reductions in our defence forces has been that the main theme of our policy must be to make friends with the countries around us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I remember, too, that Japan had been our ally and was our friend until we had to sacrifice some of the best <span class="highlight">men</span> of this country by sending them up in Wirraways to defend our country against an aggressive Japan which was armed far better than we were, even though we always had the idea that Japan was incapable of modern armament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* The <span class="highlight">men</span> cannot leave Australia, they cannot do any harm, yet today they are languishing in gaol and are likely to remain there for at least 2 months, bewildered and frightened, with no warm clothing in a strange country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0)

* If the Government is not prepared to remit the fines and allow them to return home to their families whom they have not seen for many months because they are being held in AustraliaI think it would not be beyond the bounds of reasonableness for the Commonwealth to do this- at least it should let them out of gaol and allow them to lead ordinary lives among their own community, which has been looking after them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0)

* I say that here we have actions of unique and naked courage by 2 <span class="highlight">men</span> who are projecting to the world a message which is not only a message that in Russia there is the supression of freedom- intellectual freedom as well as physical freedom- but a message which must be understood in its other implication. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0)

* In so doing we should draw to the attention of the world the fact that the challenge runs to the very peace of the world and to the integrity of those kinds of agreements like SALT- the Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement- which in our view have created a significant hallmark in the form of a detente between the great powers of the world.

* The dissident movement in the Soviet Union developed following Khrushchev's admission to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party that the horrors of the Stalinist period, which had long been known to discerning people throughout the rest of the world but which had been denied by the communist movement throughout the world, in fact had occurred.

* If we are sincere- and I give credit to the mover and seconder of the motion as being sincere- in our attempt to help these <span class="highlight">men</span> I believe that we can do so by being restrained, temperate, avoiding hymns of hate and by reminding the Soviet Union that it lives in the world, that it needs the goodwill and the help of the world to develop its own system to nourish in the world and that the cause of detente is served by paying regard to the liberties which are considered to be a minimum requirement of civilised society.

* But putting people into psychiatric hospitals and administering to them mind destroying drugs which  Senator Carrick  has mentioned and which Solzhenitsyn particularly emphasises, is, I believe, the ultimate in human cruelty because it results in the destruction of the last refuge which man would have under these circumstances, and that is his free mind and a freedom to exercise his mind.

 Senator Laucke 's figures seem to indicate that there could be a surplus of $ 15m at the end of 3 years, and I am very serious when I say that if $ 15m of growers' money is to be tied up by the Government over a period of 3 years, the growers are entitled to receive interest on it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0)

* However in the Vietnam conflict, conscription was used to provide junior officers and <span class="highlight">men</span> when the size of the volunteer Regular Army was found inadequate for the scale of involvement which that government sought. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* As the report says: 'There is within the Citizen Military Forces, considerable resentment of the fact that they were not called to active service in Vietnam, and a general lack of confidence in the national intention to employ them short of a fullscale mobilization, which is seen as a remote possibility. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* These changes could come as a disappointment in some ways to members of some individual units affected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* The Government is sensitive to these feelings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* Also, these changes must come because it is clear that many young <span class="highlight">men</span> leave the CMF as they find the training boring, repetitive and unrealistic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* 
 Mr President, let me assure you that there must be no doubt that this Government is determined to improve the CMF. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* It will give this country a reorganised CMF which is not only attractive to the young <span class="highlight">men</span> and women who wish to serve in it but with the Regular Army will also provide a viable base for expansion should this be necessary in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* It has been one of the risks of politics ever since the game began that the Crown should benefit its <span class="highlight">men</span>, and members of the legislature who appeared to be capable of being useful to the Crown were the objects of its patronage and preferment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0)

* I am not aware whether the gentleman is visiting Australia or whether the Australian Government is contributing towards his expenses. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-26-0)

* If he is visiting Australia at the invitation of the Australian Government I think it is relevant to remind the honourable senator that in this modern day and age  Mr Khrushchev  once visited the United States of America and  President  Nixon visited the Soviet Union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-26-0)

* I believe that the Prime Minister and his Government can be likened to a group of <span class="highlight">men</span> who set out to plan the perfect crime. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0)

* On 2 April 1974, this Government tabled in the Parliament a report and draft Bill on the Defence Force Disciplinary Code. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* This Bill eliminates obsolete offences, reduces general levels of punishment, and modernises such matters as sentencing, trial and review. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* It will ensure effective discipline in the defence force, but at the same time it will ensure that the rights of individual servicemen are preserved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Reengagement rates of servicemen finishing their contracts and signing on again have seldom been higher. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* The main shortfall- and this is not such a large one- is that we need 300 or 400 more fit young <span class="highlight">men</span> for the Army's Field Force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Much is being done to improve the training and the professional education of servicemen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* The Government has recently approved- what our predecessors failed to do- the establishment of an Australian Defence Academy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* It will provide, in the one establishment, education at a tertiary level for officer cadets of all 3 Services, for some cadets from overseas, and for selected serving officers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* The Government has also approved proposals under which the orientation and initial military training of Army officers will be centralised, in the early 1980s, in one training establishment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Turning to matters of Service organisation, I am pleased to be able to say that the Government's decisions that I announced in May 1973 on the future size and shape of the Australian Regular Army are progressing smoothly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* Essentially, the Government decided to maintain the divisional structure but reorganise the Regular Army Field Force on the basis of 6 battalions, each with appropriate combat and logistic support forces. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* I said then that there must be no doubt that this Government is determined to improve the CMF, that it will give this country an Army Reserve which is attractive to the young <span class="highlight">men</span> and women who wish to serve in it, and which, with the Regular Army, will also provide a viable base for expansion should this be necessary in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* By its ineptitude this Government is doing great harm to industry which needs to be kept in motion and trained and prepared in materials and <span class="highlight">men</span> in case we are called upon to defend ourselves or to help defend our treaty partners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* This is one of the reasons why I see no fun or joy in the Minister's statement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* This has been truly said by commentators who in recent months have not shown favour towards Opposition parties or to individual members of the Opposition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* One commentator writing about our defence Services said that the Government was so ashamed but so impressed with its lack of policy regarding the defence services and so ashamed of what it was doing by whittling them down that the Minister or any other member of the Government would not be game to stand up and make or have prepared by their dozens of writers a statement setting out fully, unequivocably and truthfully what comprises the Services as fighting Services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* There is a reduction in the forces and in procurement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* The statement which has been made is a statement outlining the indefinite deferral of defence equipment procurement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* The people of Australia should understand that those items of equipment in regard to which the Government is silent or in regard to which it confesses it will take no action, in fact are vital to the defence of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* If we want young <span class="highlight">men</span> to serve in our forces it is our primary duty to give them the best military hardware on earth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* This defence statement is outrageous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* I think that the honourable senator was unfair in speaking harshly of the 2 gentlemen he named, gentlemen I have not met. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* I know that he is anxious to make statements outside the Parliament and to state that these <span class="highlight">men</span> are super bureaucrats who receive $25,000 a year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* This is his Government's scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* It is his Government's trickydicky explanation to the people of this nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* Mr President,  do you know what the Government does with this alleged intelligent table which is the only one to show the cost? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* The yearly taxable income jumps from $2,200 to $2,210 which is $10 a year extra; and the Government gives a table for those amounts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* The difference in the 5 categories which the Government gives is $62 a year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* In this table the Government shows that in relation to the extra $10- which is the difference between the taxable yearly income of $2,200 and $2,2 10- if one claims $ 100 for dependants the Government takes $5 out of the $ 10 which leaves one with $5. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* If one has the princely income of $2,272 which is where the table cuts out and which works out at about $45 a week, one is getting $62 a year income over the fellow who is paying nothing with a $100 claim for dependants, and out of that extra $62 a year income, the Government takes $30.67 for hospital and medical benefits. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* That is the Government's free medical scheme for the little man; and one has to have dependants to get that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* But we cannot find any little <span class="highlight">men</span> on $45 a week. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* The great tragedy of this Parliament today is that those things which are thought to be clever in order to get one's own way in politics are becoming the accepted standard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* Previously, even in the little State of Tasmania, when somebody found that he had inadvertently given an untruthful answer to a question he immediately resigned his seat in Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* I suggest that if one looks at the records of this Parliament in the last few weeks one finds that there can be no other conclusion but that deliberate lies have been told to trick not only the people but now the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0)

* The Northern Territory section of my Department has arranged for  Mr John  Hunter, who has great experience and who is acceptable to the Aborigines, to undertake an in-depth study to see what, if anything, can be done to reduce any such incidents or prevent a recurrence of such incidents in the future.

* I know from my own knowledge of the sheer tragedy of situations in the past, in fact since Federation, when inadequate provision has been made for Governors-General on retirement in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0)

* In an era when women are asserting more and more successfully and more justifiably their equality before the law and in all respects with <span class="highlight">men</span>, I suggest it is not appropriate that marriage should be regarded as constituting a right to permanent support no matter what the circumstances and no matter whether or not a woman is capable of taking her place in the work force.

* I do not think it has done the women of Australia any good to have this special privilege in the area of widows pensions because it makes it look as though it is a problem germane only to women in Australia instead of what it truly is, namely a family problem in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0)

* I make a strong plea to the Government that, in these inquiries and considerations that it appears to be undertaking, it look at just the simple facts, and that is that we have a family situation in which there is only one parent.

* I think in the case of a man who wishes to stay at home to care for his children full time or who wishes to take a part-time job and receive a part-time pension, there should be no difference made between him, in that reduced earning capacity, and women who have been in that capacity traditionally for a long time in Australia.

* Decisions were made at a distance, while individuals at the Department of Social Security in Queensland were certainly aware of the problem because they faced the problem- they literally came face to face with the <span class="highlight">men</span> who were in this invidious position- and there was virtually no support available.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0)

* The only way in which that can be done is the way which was suggested in the Senate Committee's report, namely, that the Family Court should be set up under a co-operative arrangement between the Federal Government and the State governments so that a majority of the judges of the court will be appointed by the State governments and will be subject, as State judges can be, to retirement at a suitable age. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0)

* Experience has shown that the definition of aged person in the principal Act- namely <span class="highlight">men</span> aged 65 and over and women aged 60 and over- is somewhat arbitrary and that people in younger aged groups often suffer from handicaps or disabilities which result in them also needing accommodation of the type provided under the Aged Persons Homes Act.

* In recent times, along with many other members of this Parliament, I have had an opportunity to meet and to mix with a large number of people, <span class="highlight">men</span> and women of varying religious and political attitudes, and it has become more and more evident to me that in reference to this piece of legislation there is in their minds a determination that they need a full measure of time to examine something which is basic to them, something which must come with a measure of change but something which they are not prepared to admit in its present immense and virtually unresearched form. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* It does, however, urge the Government in reaching agreements with the States to be less coercive and to be more co-operative and to give the States the opportunity to function according to the principles employed in carrying out their jobs in the way they know. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0)

* The Opposition urges the Government to stop the nonsense of this paper war, to cut out the gross and lavish expenditure on form filling that is going on, to stop the irritation caused by the little <span class="highlight">men</span> with forms and questionnaires tearing all over Australia and to get on with the job of achieving true co-operative federalism. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0)

* I am quite sure that if the Australian Government were prepared to make available sufficient money to the authorities in Queensland so that all the people employed on the communities could be paid the award wage, then the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and particularly the Director of Aboriginal Affairs would be only too happy to pay every person on the communities the full award wage and slightly better, that is, if they had sufficient money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0)

* I see no real reason for increasing the number of <span class="highlight">men</span> on this Corporation body, nor can I see the logic behind the suggestion that the Minister should have the capacity to literally continue asking the industry to keep on submitting names until he finds four that are acceptable to him.

* I believe that a royal commission of some kind would bring to light not only the atrocities which are being perpetrated against Aborigines and of which  Senator Keeffe  has spoken but also the fact that there are occasions when members of law enforcement agencies need to chastise and bring to justice Aborigines who are not doing the right thing.

* I must deal just briefly with the sort of concept which  Senator Scott  raised- that there was perhaps some sneaking desire on the part of the Government to establish some sort of isolated intellectual ghetto for trade union officials to which they would be spirited away, indoctrinated by malevolent <span class="highlight">men</span> and returned to society to bring the capitalist system crashing to the ground.

* There was a time when one could fairly have said of Australian society that employment in the Public Service in the prime instance offered to people great security of employment and in general rather lower pay and higher benefits in the form of superannuation, leave and conditions of that kind, whereas in the open market place, in private enterprise or for self-employed people the reverse tended to be the case.

* This will not be done upon the basis of the user's requirements and the efficiency of the equipment which the defence people would want for their services, but simply on the basis that the Commission thinks it would be good for Australian industry if a piece of equipment were used which was produced in Australia with no acknowledgement as to its efficacy or its use.

* I must say that I commend  Mr Fraser  for having made a serious attempt to give us an alternative to the Budget, which the Government considers to be the most responsible Budget possible at the moment, but with respect to him I suggest that he has grievously understated the cost of his revenue proposals and has substantially overstated the potential savings from his proposed expenditure restraints.

* On present trends, the unemployment rate could increase to 8 per cent of the work force or close on 500 000 people by early next year when school leavers commence looking for jobs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38)

* We find, for example, that conventions are the basis upon which Parliament functions- conventions which are not readily identifiable or found in the Constitution or in any decision of the High Court, but conventions upon which the Parliament itself could not operate without some degree of understanding and some degree of common sense, bearing in mind that many of these conventions are related to the Westminster system of government.

* Surely  Senator Greenwood  can understand this difficulty: The word has gone around among the criminal element in the Croatian community that, if one is sent to gaol and one has rendered oneself liable to deportation under the Migration Act, the thing to do is to spread it about that one is a member of a Croatian terrorist organisation; that way one will not be deported to Yugoslavia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46)

* We do not propose to have people who are ordinary common criminals, who should be deported, who will be deported and who normally would be deported to Yugoslavia preserved from being returned to Yugoslavia merely by some phoney story that they are <span class="highlight">men</span> of great principle, although they may be anarchists or terrorists, and that they will be in some peril if they are deported to Yugoslavia.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* 1 agree that the attitude taken by some sectors of the public, namely that what the Opposition was doing was unconstitutional, was in the first place inflamed by the immediate statement made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to the effect that the Senate was acting unconstitutionally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* When that breakdown comes, when violence occurs in the home that seems to be happening with increasing frequency these days- there needs to be a place of quiet where people can go, talk to other people, talk out the problem and be assured that things can be better, that something can be done, that they are not mad but that it is just the pressure of modern society that has pushed them out of kilter for the moment.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30)

* The point I take up with  Senator Guilfoyle  is that in cases like this, which will be intensified with family reunions, we ought to have a clear cut understanding with the Portuguese Government that if people come to Australia who are more than 65 years of age their cheques will continue to flow from Lisbon or, conversely, if that is not satisfactory I think we should examine further the formula whereby we lump together three or four people in a family who may be working as domestics and whose salaries are not very high.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0)

* In fact, of course, it is common knowledge that a great deal of idealistic young <span class="highlight">men</span> in Australia actually volunteered to go and fight with the Spanish Republican Army. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0)

* If a conservative government had been in power in Australia at the time I have no doubt that even though it may have been a little chary of openly stating its preference for Franco, it could have brought itself to specify that the armed forces of Franco were those that came within the meaning of this provision and could have lifted the embargo on recruitment of volunteers or mercenaries to go to fight with the Franco forces.

* Some of the clauses of the Bill, particularly clause 7 relating to the training of armed <span class="highlight">men</span> within Australia and the drilling of armed <span class="highlight">men</span> within Australia, are essential and I do not think anybody on either side of the Senate could oppose these propositions in any way.

* With regard to  Senator Missen  's point concerning the non-legal  chairman  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, I think the Government would share the concern that he has expressed and the views that have been expressed by the learned <span class="highlight">men</span> who have considered this question that there is a great deal to be said for chairmen of these tribunals having legal qualifications although other expertise is required on these tribunals.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0)

* I notice that the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  refers in his second reading speech to the multitude of awards, as though the State governments had hoodwinked the then Federal Government when it took over the State railway systems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0)

* We should compare the annual hours worked by a railway shunter, a locomotive engineman or those who work in many other grades with the hours worked by one or two of those retired gentlemen to whom  Senator Wright  rightly referred and who work only eight or nine months of the year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0)

* He suggested that the consistent favouring of Western Australia, as he saw it- the consistent allocation by the Commonwealth of a greater percentage of road funds than had been recommended by the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads- was a sign that it pays to be unco-operative. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0)

* I would have thought that if one bore in mind the different characters of these 3 <span class="highlight">men</span> it became fairly obvious that it was an oversimplification to suggest that some form of uncooperative behaviour lay behind the significant excess over the Bureau of Roads recommendations which have applied for the last 10 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0)

* It suggested to me that the significant increase over the Bureau of Roads allocation could be related to a great contribution which Western Australia has made and is able to make to the economic development of Australia and to the peculiar difficulties that Western Australia suffers because of its vast area and long distance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0)

* As a basis from which to work, we must accept that a strong industrial trade union movement is a part of our industrial life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* But after the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and before it was debated the air traffic controllers dispute occurred, which clearly showed the Government that it could not succeed in crushing the trade union movement through a confrontation with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* That dispute clearly showed the Government that industry today relies so much on technology and machinery and the labour force is so specialised that a small group of employees can simply paralyse the nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* The approach to be adopted with the workers is to try to find a means by which government can confer with them and their organisations as equal partners in this system of running the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* I cannot understand why  Mr Willis  or any of his colleagues should suggest that there has been a breaking by the Government of the agreements that have been reached between  Mr Hawke,  the ACTU and CAGEO. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is a recognition of the public interest that is perhaps paramount in the establishment of a working circumstance between labour and capital, employer and employee- call it what you will- because that sort of circumstance will be found in every sort of society in every country, and it is our job and our duty to ensure that it is a circumstance to which there is a real and proper solution.

* I note that in the other place a day or two ago  Mr Clyde  Cameron, in speaking on this legislation, said:   the trade union movement of this country could bring down this Government simply by bringing out a few key <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* At times they have not hesitated even to dictate to this Parliament, this great democratic institution which is representative qf every adult male and female in the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* If it is good enough to tell the trade union movement that Bill Smith is a good union official or that he should not be a union official, it is good enough to refer to members of the Bench and say, for example, that Justice Staples has his virtues and ask what his future will be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* I put it to him that at the present time this trade practices legislation not only is adding significantly to unemployment in the petrol distribution area, but also is breaking down the conditions of the people employed in the industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* At the present time because of a heavy discounting war in Brisbane and possibly in New South Wales and Victoria, senior <span class="highlight">men</span> who have worked in the industry for a number of years are being dismissed and juniors are taking their place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* To get away from being emotive and to return to the Bill, since we have it and since we find it hard to understand I hope, as I said, that I will be assisted by our legal <span class="highlight">men</span> in this chamber, who may be able to provide me with some understanding and some comfort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* The major grounds upon which my opposition to this Bill and these amendments is based are, firstly, that I believe that proposed new section 45D will provoke a direct confrontation with the trade union movement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* I know that the Government has moved away from the position of imposing a $50,000 fine on an individual who is engaged in a so-called secondary boycott, but it has still left a $250,000 penalty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* The Trade Practices Amendment Bill was described by the first speaker in the second reading debate today as, I think, beyond nearly everyone but 2 members of the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* As the Bill is essentially one dealing with business practices, and as 2 professional <span class="highlight">men</span>- a legal man and a professional accountant- had difficulty in understanding it, it is nearly impossible for the layman to interpret the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* In view of this, there is some doubt as to whether the <span class="highlight">men</span> are now unemployed as a result of direct industrial action or whether, as some sources indicate, Consolidated Meat Holdings Ltd has closed down for purely economic reasons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0)

* But really no problems arose by that time because the new boards, with the new expertise appointed to them- <span class="highlight">men</span> of very great ability- had demonstrated the value of that form of restructuring.

* Despite the fact that women have constituted one-third of the work force until very recently, the unemployment rate for women as measured is higher than the rate for <span class="highlight">men</span> in every category, and this is despite the fact that the mechanisms for recording the number of unemployed women are quite unsatisfactory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* The position in Australia is that the current practice in regard to the payment of the unemployment benefit, for which being registered as seeking employment is a necessary prerequisite, discriminates quite disastrously against married persons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* I say 'married persons', not 'married women', because the Act does not discriminate on the basis of sex. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* However, it does discriminate against spouses whose partners are in employment to the extent that if persons who are married lose employment they are ineligible for the unemployment benefit if their spouse earns in excess of $6 a week. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* The overworked and understaffed staff at the Commonweath Employment Service offices do discourage women in these circumstances from registering as unemployed because they recognise that those women, or <span class="highlight">men</span> if that happens to be the case, are not eligible for the unemployment benefit and indeed their chances of finding employment through the Commonwealth Employment Service are very small indeed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* Despite the fact that so many women do not register, for the reasons that I have just explained, the unemployment statistics still show a higher rate of unemployment amongst women than amongst <span class="highlight">men</span> in every category and in some categories it is quite disastrously higher. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0)

* The Australian Bureau of Statistics, which of course surveys unemployment in a different way from the Commonwealth Employment Service- it generally conducts surveys based on random sampling of persons in houses rather than people who come along to Commonwealth Employment Service offices- recently carried out a survey of the work force called 'The Labour Force, May 1977 '.

* So, in a way that is quite different from that for <span class="highlight">men</span> and in a way that shows that they are much more disadvantaged than <span class="highlight">men</span>, women often are judged to be too young or too old for work which they would be qualified to do.

* In faa, a change of the budget does not involve a change in ministry; and I rejoice that it is so, because I think it would be most unpardonable obstinancy on the part of public <span class="highlight">men</span> to adhere to the terms of a budget which was opposed to the wishes and feelings of parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1)

* It would be unfortunate for the free exercise of the judgment of this House, if the rejection of any portion of a budget were to be construed into a vote of want of confidence. ' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0)

* I am saa to have to say that, despite a change of government in December 1975, quietly and almost unnoticed the employers and the Federation were allowed to renew the agreement with that provision in it, namely, that there would be no redundancy on the waterfront except such as was voluntarily applied for by the Federation.

* As my colleague  Senator Walters  said, the results of this agreement have been a strong impact on Austraiian pons, peculiar incidents at Tasmanian ports and on air traffic between the various islands that are supported from Tasmania.

* Dealing with the eight Bills in summary, what they do is transfer to the Arbitration Commission the authority that hitherto resided in the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to fix the number of <span class="highlight">men</span> required at any port, that is to say, the quota.

* They then transfer to the Arbitration Commission the decision as to the circumstances in which waterside workers will be employed to assist in the performance of the companies' work, by reason of the fact that the number of such workers regularly employed at the port is insufficient; also, matters relating to recruitment and attendance money.

* The Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in December 1974 on the basis of a report by a Working Party on Homeless <span class="highlight">Men</span> and Women, which recommended, amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to $5m a year should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local and statutory authorities for approved projects- such as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units- in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> and women.

* It was thought that at the end of three years the Government and the Parliament would be in a better position to decide, for instance, whether refuges for women, which are at present funded under the community health program, should become part of the homeless persons program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* She has said that a wider program may be needed and that the Homeless Persons Assistance Act may be a suitable vehicle to cover such things as women's shelters generally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* The previous Government thought that after three years it would be in a better position to consider whether rehabilitation pursuits should have a higher or lower priority than the provision of shelter and whether the provision of day centres should become an important part of the homeless persons program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* We looked forward to the results of this evaluation to see whether the program was on the right track, to see what sort of difficulties it had come up against, to see whether the requirements needed changing and whether the funding in this area was adequate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* The homeless persons assistance program, like all programs of this type, had some difficulties getting off the ground, mainly because of lack of experience in dealing with this problem of homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> and because society in general has some difficulty in coping with it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* These people tend to be rejected and neglected by society, as are criminals and some people who are mentally ill. Society does not like to talk and think about them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* There is a very real problem in establishing residential centres for homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> because no one in the community seems to want these people in their area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* The real problems that can arise when society neglects these people was seen recently in Queensland when the police raided a timber mill and found several of these <span class="highlight">men</span> being exploited by unscrupulous people.

* The Minister, in her second reading speech, gave no indication that the Government is considering a longer view of the homeless people and their vulnerability in society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* That vulnerability is obviously exposed when we see such cases as the one I referred to earlier, in Brisbane, of <span class="highlight">men</span> who are exploited under the present system, <span class="highlight">men</span> who are lured to work in appalling conditions.

* It must be combined with programs of active community development to help to give people the capacity they require and to allow society to intervene, if you wish, at an earlier stage in the process. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* We happen to believe that this is one way of intervening effectively at an earlier stage to prevent the emergence of homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> requiring assistance under this Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* Through the Brisbane City Council we were able to offer premises in Roma Street and on the south side, but they were of such substantial size that the amount of money needed to establish them in order to carry out the work of the club was beyond the scope of the organising committee, which consists mainly of the <span class="highlight">men</span> themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* It seems to me to be extraordinary that the 139 Club is seeking financial assistance but is unable to obtain anything beyond payment of half the salary of a social worker, lt might as well get nothing because if it cannot find the other half of the salary the gesture is merely an empty one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* If that is the reason and if the State Government fails to come to the party, will the fact that the social worker finds it uneconomic to continue mean the disbandment of this small group? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* If organisations of this sort are institutionalised certain industrial awards would have to be complied with and as a result the cost to the government would be considerably greater. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0)

* The Government claims, in classic doublespeak, that it is removing discrimination against married women but, in fact, brings sickness benefits into line with unemployment benefits by altering the benefits available to married <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0)

* When the supporting mother's benefit was introduced by the previous Government, a benefit for supporting fathers was not introduced; it did not seem to be much of an issue at the time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0)

* In some cases the father has to stay at home and live on a special benefit, which is entirely inappropriate for such <span class="highlight">men</span> and involves them in considerable personal difficulty in having to front up to the Department of Social Security every week to justify receiving the benefit.

* I expressed my concern that the rural areas are the hardest hit but in some cases it is necessary for <span class="highlight">men</span>, with families grown up and in need of employment, to determine whether it is of more benefit to them to leave their homes, their friends, and their work in the hope that their children may get employment in a larger town or in the city.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0)

* To me it creates the ridiculous situation in that it is lawful to engage with armed forces of a foreign country against the government of another country that we recognise de jure, but if that foreign country undertakes subversive activity and camouflages its forces as civilians and an Australian joins that foreign country's forces and takes part in hostile activities against another government, it is an offence.

* The Commission in fact will be asked to advise the Minister or to give the Minister the advice that the Minister wants to hear and the Government will then be able to use the advice or the recommendations it receives from the IAC as an excuse or as a shelter for the Government's economic policies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0)

* I suggest that the Government has designed the legislation in order to ensure that the Commission becomes not an independent inquiry body but, as it were, a secondary policy arm of the Government- a supporting policy arm of the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0)

* I am sure that all of us would wish that, when an honourable senator feels it necessary to make allegations against a member of this Parliament or of a State parliament, at the earliest time the facts be made available to the Senate so that the Senate itself can decide whether there is a real basis to the allegations or whether they are made without a firm foundation.

* At page 8 of this report there is a reference to the fact that the <span class="highlight">men</span> employed under normal wage provisions averaged, at permanent ports, $229.60 per week for 24.7 hours- that is to say, $229 a week for 25 hours.

* The report brings to our notice that, despite the decline of 12.4 per cent in the work force, the total gross payments credited to waterside workers at all ports, excluding long service leave and redundancy payments, increased by 4.8 per cent to a total of $129,160,992.

* As I have pointed out, one of the cardinal terms of the permanent employment arrangements was, as could be foreseen- and the report I am referring to makes this clear- that as mechanical means developed in the industry it would be necessary to have less and less manual labour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0)

* Therefore, in decasualising the waterfront and altering the basis of waterside employment from casual work to weekly employment- now called permanent employment- it was a cardinal condition that the Authority, if application were made to it by the employers, should have the right compulsorily to retire <span class="highlight">men</span> with proper long service payment, with proper redundancy payments, paying all sick leave and annual leave up to date, but if the number of people registered were in excess of labour requirements the Authority, with responsibility to provide quotas and to ensure that the labour was usefully employed, had the power under that arrangement compulsorily to retire people on the terms- quite generous terms- to which I have referred. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0)

* Under the advice of a conference presided over by  Mr Justice  Robinson at first and then the Ministerforsaking the advice of his colleagues and preferring the advice of  Sir Richard  Kirby, who was paid upwards of $6,000 at the rate of $125 a day- was misled, I believe, into the situation of accepting an extravagant program of redundancy payments, the like of which ought to shock the whole community.

* It is submitted that the Aboriginal Police will be basically Inspectors employed by the Local Authority to see that the by-laws are observed and although such a power is now expressly given to members of the Queensland Police force it is suggested that the Police Commissioner define to his Officers and <span class="highlight">men</span> when such a control will be exercised so that the Local Authority can consider itself to be independent and able to carry out a similar role to other Local Authorities.

* In order to facilitate this process, and against the background of the Government's commitment to establish and maintain a high and stable level of employment, and the assumption by the Commonwealth of responsibility for the administration of unemployment benefit, the Act provided for the formal establishment of a decentralised Commonwealth Employment Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-60-0)

* I have quoted from the speeches of five Ministers and seven back benchers, the seven back benchers being a sample of the people in this chamber who now represent the Government which came to power by talking about probity in government, principle, continuity and all those things which have become part of the rhetoric of Australian politics. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0)

* Of course, if they consult their own words in 1 974 and 1 975 when dealing with almost identical legislation, I suggest that those Ministers, those honourable senators, those honourable <span class="highlight">men</span>, will have no alternative when weighing the issues in this debate but to maintain the principles which they enunciated with such conviction in 1974 and 1975.

* The working party on homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> and women recommended amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to $5m a year should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local statutory authorities for approved projects- such as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units- in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> and women.

 Senator Chaney, who is in charge of the Bill knows very well, having sat here during this debate, that we heard  Senator Maunsell  from the National Country Party and  Senator Thomas  say that they were not in agreement with a reduction of the bounty, yet  Senator Chaney  says that they are going to support the Government's position.

* A common complaint made by those who are helping the homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> in our community is that the average age is falling because of unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0)

* One of the themes implicit in the legislation since its inception, and a strong theme in 'A Place of Dignity' and in other papers and documents on this subject, has been the undesirability of treating homeless persons as outcasts and the desirability of considering them as members of our society who need short term or long term help to survive and who can often be assisted to find a more satisfactory way of life- frequently to find a job- as a result of the facilities provided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0)

* We should always recognise that the problems they face mainly are personal ones which have kept them apart from family and friends, and that their way of life without a settled environment adds to the problems.

* Understanding from welfare agencies and even banks and medical services can be a big factor in building up selfrespect in these people, as can the establishment of a rights program to lessen the sort of authoritarian structure that we have used to deal with these people in the past.

* As  Senator Grimes  has said, this Act was introduced in December 1974 by his party when it was in government as a result of a report by a working party on homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> and women.

* In that comment  Senator Walsh  is denigrating the Australian Wool Industry Conference so, presumably, he would not be having discussions with either the AWIC, Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council or the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* I had outlined what I believed to be the failures by this Government not only to do anything about unemployment as such but also to do anything about or come to any realisation of the sort of souldestroying situation in which thousands of young persons in rural areas of the State that I represent are placed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0)

* I was pointing out that in fact the Government could well have taken a page from the election platform of the United Australia Party in 1943 when it was proclaiming what it would do once war ended, to wit, introduce a national insurance scheme, on a contributory basis, beginning with insurance against unemployment, immediately victory is achieved and peace returns. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0)

* Even now there are elements in Australia seeking to replace the government of <span class="highlight">men</span> by the administration of things, a trend to which we in Parliament have contributed by unthinkingly vesting power over people in non-elected bodies and corporations  and by seeking to rely upon ombudsmen and tribunals to protect the rights of individuals when in fact it is we who should be making the decisions and we who should be providing the protection.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0)

* If it has no application, for God's sake let us delete subsection (4) of proposed new section 73E and not have any more argument about it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0)

* Do we, as senators, have the necessary intestinal fortitude to initiate innovative and far reaching legislation, or are we to give truth to the fallacy that we are a chamber of stoic old <span class="highlight">men</span> and women, deaf to the voice of the people, a mere rubber stamp of that other place? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0)

* I see the wisdom of years, and I pray to God that I also see <span class="highlight">men</span> and women of principle: <span class="highlight">men</span> and women of vision, <span class="highlight">men</span> and women who are not the mere minions of government and bureaucracy, but <span class="highlight">men</span> and women who are now prepared to stand up and be counted, and are in tune with the song of freedom that is presently resounding throughout this nation.

* If honourable member's choose to ignore this lone Aborigine 's words, dare they cast aside the words of these two <span class="highlight">men</span> of learning? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0)

* To further reinforce the need for the provisions of this Bill, I quote directly from  Aborigines, A Statement of Concern,  prepared by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, for the Catholic Bishops of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0)

* As  Senator Bishop  pointed out also,  Senator Laucke,  the  President  of the Senate, made the statement that day that we ought to go forward as a united body of <span class="highlight">men</span> and endeavour to convince the Government that it ought to give its full support to this project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0)

* We were given that day a copy of a submission made to the Government on this very matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0)

* I wish to read from page 1 of that document which was in the form of a submission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0)

* It was introduced in 1918, and I would recommend that everyone read the debates right back to that year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0)

* We had thousands of returned servicemen who had been on five bob a day and who were returning to Australia with no money, no skills, no jobs- nothing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0)

* The 700 that was then provided for war service homes purposes presented the only way in which the vast majority of those <span class="highlight">men</span> were ever likely to get a start in life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0)

* People who have in the last few years spent a three-year stint in the Army, who have had a wonderful life, excellent conditions, good pay, a high degree of training and have come out better educated <span class="highlight">men</span>, with careers in front of them, have also had these bonuses offered- quite unrealistically in relation to their situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0)

* I fail to understand why <span class="highlight">men</span> and women who pledge to serve Australia should be charged different home insurance premiums solely because they live in Queensland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0)

* Why is there to be no legal requirement on any member of the Authority to have experience or qualifications directly relevant to the environmental sciences? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0)

* We believe that many people, conservationists and others, will see this alteration to the professional requirements of the  Chairman  as an attempt to re-order the legislation and to fit it to a particular nominee for the job. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0)

* The Australian Conservation Foundation is disturbed by this proposed amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0)

* It did not want any change to the legal requirement for relevant expertise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0)

* Although it is true that the existing requirements make it too difficult to find suitably qualified people for the job of  Chairman,  I believe that this ought not to lead to the weakening of the qualifications of the status of the position. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0)

* But these two <span class="highlight">men</span> are limited in respect of the basic scientific requirements that are needed for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef and the development of a concept that will protect the delicate ecosystem of the Reef. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0)

* My attention was drawn to an article that appeared yesterday or today in the Melbourne  Age  headed: 'ALP <span class="highlight">men</span> claim Whitlam failure'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0)

* In this setting I mention the closure of Kelsall and Kemp, regarded for many years as the finest woollen mill in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* This is one of the reasons for my presence in this Parliament and the tone of my speech tonight. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* At that mill there was a working environment that would be the envy of most industrialists because people were not regarded as cogs in a machine but as contributors to a joint working experience producing high quality products based on a pride in workmanship frequently handed down within the family circle. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* I recall one such dedicated group where 19 members were employed in various departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* This was typical of the loyalty of those <span class="highlight">men</span> and women. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* The effect of government decisions on people was therefore brought home very strongly to me during those tortuous months of closure of the mill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* On one occasion a government official spoke glibly of the little social consequence of the closure since in his mind most of the <span class="highlight">men</span> could obtain jobs and a high proportion of the women were married. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* In such a plaintive analysis, by merely examining the prefix  'Mrs' to  a person's surname, he did not account for the social implications to the divorced, the separated and the effective breadwinners often because of a strained domestic situation or because work was a means of supporting a family suffering tremendous financial hardship due to illness or accident or even a means for a mother to seek relief and companionship on a five-hour twilight shift while the husband handled the family pressures of a prolonged terminal illness of one of their children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* I ask honourable senators not to take decisions lightly when people 's livelihoods are in jeopardy because the spin-off effects on social life are tremendous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Services start off with a simple piece of equipment but almost always finish up with an enormously expensive and elaborate piece of equipment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* I do not know of any other words with which to describe the position than these: With 300 <span class="highlight">men</span>, six 4.5 inch automatic guns and bofors one felt like a bully when bailing up a fishing boat with a Malayan family on board. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0)

* I comment only very briefly on the speech of  Senator Walters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* I am not impressed by that argument. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* That is not the argument that members on this side would have been prepared to advance when our own Government introduced for the first time the conscription of young <span class="highlight">men</span> to go and fight in Vietnam following an election at which there had been no issue about conscription and from which there was no conceivable way of saying that a mandate was given on one side or the other. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* But there is one time, I believe, when <span class="highlight">men</span> should have a conscience vote; there is one time when <span class="highlight">men</span> should have a conscience. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* I expect governments to legislate to protect me from charlatans, rogues and exploiters and to promote a good life for my children, and I will make the decision about whether I should have children. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* I believe that abortion is abhorrent to all <span class="highlight">men</span> and women of goodwill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* I do not have the honourable senator's expertise in this subject so I am sorry I cannot comment on that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* I believe the noble philosophy that I have espoused that abortion is abhorrent to all <span class="highlight">men</span> and women of goodwill for the reason that I have given is viable only in a perfect society- and God knows we do not live in a perfect society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* Very few could argue against the right to life, and I will speak in a moment about what I believe the right to life means. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* The other conflicting philosophy mentioned by  Senator Button  was the right of freedom of choice, the freedom of choice of a woman. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* To my knowledge, very few <span class="highlight">men</span> are ever faced with the dilemma of whether they should have an abortion but women are. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* 
 -If Senator Walters could give me the names of those <span class="highlight">men</span> I believe that a certain institution has a thousand dollars first prize for every man in this country who has ever had a baby or who has ever become pregnant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* The terrible choice is with women. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* Without going into the morality of that situation, I think one can conclude at least one thing, and that is that there is massive sexual ignorance in Australia today by both <span class="highlight">men</span> and women. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* To suggest that one can choose between those who will live and those who will not on the basis of whether they are going to lead comfortable and pleasant lives in circumstances of love, companionship and so on, is, I think, the height of arrogance and something which all thinking <span class="highlight">men</span> should reject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* This is an essential ingredient in the Seat of Government (Administration) Act to permit a Minister to bring in another ordinance for the period. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* The legal <span class="highlight">men</span> seem to think that it is a requirement of that Act to permit a Minister to bring in another ordinance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0)

* With the experience that I gained in the criminal courts in this country before I entered this Parliament, I believe, and have believed for a long time, that abortions should take place in public institutions and that under no circumstances should private profit or gain be involved in such delicate human decisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0)

* As I have mentioned, I have seen medical <span class="highlight">men</span> placed on trial for alleged misuse of instruments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0)

* If I thought that disallowance of this Ordinance would mean the establishment of a clinic in the grounds of a public hospital, under the control of that hospital and under the supervision of the Capital Territory Health Commission, I would support the proposition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0)

* I am not blaming departmental officers for this because they have to do what the Government tells them to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0)

* It ought to be left to the government parties to find an amount of $300,000 if they want to conduct an advertising campaign to tell people what a great body of <span class="highlight">men</span> they are in the Government and how they are reducing taxation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0)

* When I asked the officer in charge- I want it to be understood right now that in no way am I blaming the personnel of the ABS; they are operating under the instructions of the Government and we were told that, in the main, these random sample tests are carried out by middle-aged married women who they claim have certain expertise- did the ABS ever recruit for their surveys any of the people whom they found to be unemployed and single people, I was told that the ABS would sooner have people with a certain expertise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0)

* My argument is: If these people can acquire the expertise in eight weeks of intensive instruction, why is it that the unemployed people they turn up in their surveys are not given the necessary training? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0)

* The ABS could perhaps find single people or even married <span class="highlight">men</span> who are unemployed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0)

* There were no thoughts along those lines during World Wars I and II when the governments made promises to young <span class="highlight">men</span> of the day to induce them to join the armed services and to go and fight for this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51)

* Yet on the eve of war breaking out, we found  Mr Menzies  standing up in this Parliament- he was the Prime Minister- and making all sorts of promises to the young <span class="highlight">men</span> to induce them to go and fight for Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51)

* Money was found overnight to encourage people to go into the Army and to provide the armed services with the necessary equipment to fight a war. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51)

* The Committee will note that during the reign of the Whitlam Government we increased quite enormously the rates of pay for ex-servicemen and their superannuation so that many of the older <span class="highlight">men</span> in the armed services could retire and open the way for younger <span class="highlight">men</span> to avail themselves of promotion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51)

* I appreciate the interest of  Senator Archer,  indeed of all Tasmanian senators, in the development of the College which will, of course, be a very significant industry, apart from an academic institution, in Launceston. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-9)

* I think all honourable senatores will acknowledge that these two <span class="highlight">men</span> are outstanding Australians with very expert knowledge and leadership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-9)

* However, let us recognise that the <span class="highlight">men</span> who constitute the Wine Board have a particular purpose. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* Senator Douglas  McClelland mentioned that about $7,000 was paid to a Canadian agent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* If an agent had been contracted it would appear that this payment of about $7,000 in August 1977 represented a monthly payment because it is about one-twelfth of the amount that was paid in the previous year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* I know that  Senator McClelland  considers that that amount is scarcely sufficient but there is nothing further that I am able to say other than that my personal knowledge of the business acumen of individuals on the Wine Board gives me confidence that within the limits imposed by the funds available to them, they probably have allocated funds in the direction of advertising in the way that they feel will return most benefit to the people they represent recognising, of course, that the income of the Australian Wine Board is basically by way of levy on the product. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* However, I am quite sure that the comments made in this debate will be taken in the spirit in which they were made, that is, by way of encouragement for greater publicity to get the Australian product on the world market. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* I was given information by departmental officers that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation interim annual report is expected to be tabled before the end of this session. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* The comment that has been made to me is that the report has been delayed by the unavailability of the Auditor-General's certificate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* I accept the criticisms that  Senator Martin  has made and take the responsibility on my shoulders in respect of the questions that were asked through me by the Estimates Committee and on which we got into some argument over whether they should have been asked. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* In relation to confidential information, if it be considered confidential, I do not accept  Senator Georges'  comments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* If we as a Parliament agree to establish a statutory authority and place in the hands of that statutory authority the operation of a particular business proposition, we should have confidence that the <span class="highlight">men</span> in charge will have noticeable business acumen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* When we are of the view that funds are not being expended correctly I think it is quite appropriate, and it is certainly within the hands of honourable senators to do so, to suggest that a department be brought to heel for any looseness that is revealed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* The Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Chaney)  will remember that some concern has been expressed in some Navy circles in New South Wales about a suggestion that a considerable number of <span class="highlight">men</span> were billeted in huts while it was claimed members of the Women's Royal Australian Navy Service had far better quarters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* I know that this is the age of equality and all that, but in this case the <span class="highlight">men</span> concerned felt that they were being treated in an inferior fashion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* I frankly suggest that any militarist, any general, any battalion commander, any corporal in action who would make a statement such as that would be laughing up his sleeve at the time he was making it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* If they were not, even if the best situation prevailed, it is patently obvious to me that other weapons which the Indonesian Government had at that time were released for use in that campaign. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* The Government applies one standard when someone else is involved and a totally different standard is applied when it is one of our friends and we perceive some self-interest as happened in East Timor at that time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* The Minister's statement continued: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* They say that for the <span class="highlight">men</span> in the missile silos nuclear war is never more than 20 minutes away. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* It is only when a statement such as that which has been made today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  is before us that we come to realise that it is not always from occasions such as this, or emergency situations in the Security Council or visits at one time or another of delegations to crisis spots that results emanate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* We should pay tribute to that considerable group of <span class="highlight">men</span> and women who, throughout the year and almost around the clock, negotiate on behalf of Australia as well as other nations at a wide range of conferences, seminars and meetings in which the highest standard of intelligence, negotiation and diplomatic effort is called for. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* Therefore, the Minister's statement today was not only of great importance but certainly of great interest to someone who, Uke myself, has had the opportunity of seeing a great deal of diplomatic effort in progress in recent times. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* The observation is made in a document from the World Bank that, even on the most optimistic assumptions about the future progress of Third World countries and the rate of further expansion of international assistance, by the year 2000 approximately 600 million people are expected to be living in what is described as 'absolute poverty'.

* What the statement does not say- I think this ought to be said- is that the particular submission from the Attorney-General's office set out in considerable details the results of the correspondence which it had received over a period of some 20 months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* Since then, the State Government has paid the Trades and Labour Council $10,000 each year to the end of 1977 for trade union education. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53)

* That adds up to $55,000 in State Government grants which have not been properly accounted for, either to the State Premier or to the full Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53)

* Senator Harradine  not only received the first cheques paid during his term of office as Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council but also was the person who banked the 1976 cheque after he had entered the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53)

* The annual reports of the Australian Trade Union Training Authority for 1975-76 and 1976-77 made no mention of the Tasmanian Government providing any funds. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53)

* I do not believe, nor should any member of this Parliament, that we can turn our backs on technological change, but we are as  Senator Harradine  has said, confronted with a very real problem in the nature and rate of technological change as it affects the employment situation of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0)

* In fact I suggest that the Government has accelerated this change and this tendency to move people out of these areas by the introduction of technological change and by allowing some $500m each year on investment allowances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0)

* However, I think any employment surveys we have had would show that it is not always that the young person and the experienced person are competing for the same employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-26-0)

* I think that is a very big question that ought to be considered, bearing in mind that 60 years is the age at which the pension is payable to women and that 65 years is the age at which the age pension is payable to <span class="highlight">men</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-26-0)

* The result of that can only be- if they succeed- that more and more people will die earlier than they need; that more babies will die young; that more work will be lost through illness; and worst of all, that <span class="highlight">men</span> and women will spend the last years of their lives as respiratory cripples.

* When speaking to the National Press Club on Wednesday, 10 October, the Chief Minister for the Northern Territory,  Mr Paul  Everingham, suggested that the defence establishment, particularly the engineering and service corps, could provide an enormous boost to Aboriginal communities in the Territory by raising a force of approximately 1,000 Aborigines, principally to educate them in trades et cetera, which would enable them to participate more in local government-type activities.

* Employment and unemployment, the deficit, the rate of inflation, the problems of salinity in the Murray River- things of that nature- are problems which are essentially capable of solution by various policies adjusted from time to time, case by case, and which are capable of resolution in a political sense.

* Frankly, if this Government and succeeding governments are not prepared to take a far more concrete look at the funding and organisation of science policy and research in this country and if the dialogue which can take place not between political parties but within political parties and then with political parties cooperating to form a national science policy is to be relegated to something that we get round to one Thursday night once in a year because there happens to be an odd space on the agenda of the Parliament to raise them, then we are going to take the most reprehensible course of action that any parliament can take.

* In a non-partisan way and, if one likes, in an all-party way, those <span class="highlight">men</span> and women have decided that they should sit down in conference and examine this very farreaching piece of legislation, that they should have a formal meeting for this purpose for the first time in the history of industrial legislation in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55)

* This Bill is simple propaganda that no reasonable senator or citizen could support in the face of condemnation by  Sir Richard  Kirby, the elder statesman of the conciliation and arbitration movement in Australia, in the face of published objections, supported by leading editorialists, of  Mr Justice  Staples; or in the face of the unanimous condemnation by the 25 commissioners of the arbitration system or in the face of the plea tonight by  Sir John  Moore for full consultation with the Government.

* Further, honourable senators will recall that when the 'prescribed period' of the Act was extended last year, it was indicated that the program was sufficiently well established to warrant discussions with State governments on their views about the sharing of responsibilities in this area.

* It should be noted also that the program is not directed exclusively towards chronically homeless <span class="highlight">men</span> and there is a number of centres which cater exclusively for single homeless women; some agencies in developing new hostels have taken the opportunity to provide accommodation for both <span class="highlight">men</span> and women. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0)

* That, of course, is the familiar employer's argument that stand-down clauses ought to be available as of right whenever any potential economic loss is about to be incurred by an employer through industrial action somewhere else or through a failure in supply or something of that kind, that all that should be involved is the right of the employer to rush before the Commission, for everybody to drop everything as fast as possible, for the matter to be dealt with expeditiously- as this legislation will now have it- and for the employer to get his <span class="highlight">men</span> off his payroll as fast as possible.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0)

* I feel it important to start by pointing out that one of the things which those of us in this Parliament who have been concerned about drugs and drug trafficking have expressed concern about over and over again, particularly in the reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare on drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country, is that debate on this subject and consideration of it should be carried out in an unemotional and rational way.

* It is obvious to many people that this is a very serious police problem involving a co-ordinated effort throughout this country, throughout the States, and involving none of the backbiting and none of the rivalry which  Senator Chipp  quite rightly mentioned has been occurring in the law enforcement bodies trying to deal with drug trafficking in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0)
