* If it is suggested that people who associated themselves with those Moratorium rallies were in any way indulging in anti-democratic activities or any activity which is <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or disloyal then I think the Liberal Party or the Country Party which makes this charge is going to have a little difficulty in explaining how it is that organisations such as the Catholic Church have allowed their members to be associated with it.

* He then offered the puerile suggestion that I should be precluded by some standing order of this House from saying that that is seriously <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of the discipline that underlies the effectiveness of the armed forces.

* Obviously, a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity will be one which from time to time may lead at some distant point in time- it need not be a particularly distant point in time- to the use of force, which is otherwise regarded as the criterion for the designation of a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity under clause 5.

* What the members of this chamber are being asked to give their assent to is an amendment that takes out of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill the word 'ultimately' which leaves it to somebody to determine whether the activities in which a person is engaged are <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* The Government believes that anybody or any organisation which believes in and has a commitment to the use of force or violence at some future stage, even though it may not be engaged in such activities at the moment or may not even intend to engage in them in the near future, for the purposes of overthrowing the constitutional government of this country should be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and should be kept under surveillance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* If honourable senators look at the provision of clause 5( 1 )(a) they will see that it is clear that the element of intention in the person who is seeking to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> within the meaning of the clause is covered; if he engages in activities which involve, will involve or are intended to involve the overthrow of the State by violence and so on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* What we are most cautious about accepting the propriety of is the notion that activity which is simply aimed at communicating to the public at large what are perceived to be deficiencies and undemocratic qualities in the organisation in question, that that kind of proselytising activity- which in our view would come squarely within the terms of paragraph (b)- would be counted <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and brings into operation all of the apparatus that this Bill is about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* We suggest that that kind of activity, which is aimed at exposing, for better or for worse, the activities of security organisations, should be treated as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> only when it is itself, by virtue of some explicit statute or common law rule that might be applicable to it, unlawful.

* I emphasise again that we are here dealing with definitions of domestic subversion, or activities on the domestic scene that may be regarded as of a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> character, for the purpose of defining the powers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* As I said earlier in this debate, just whether or not it would be justifiable to consider a particular form of activity to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> would be a matter for the professional judgment of the Director-General of security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* But insofar as interfering with the purposes of security or the defence of the Commonwealth is concerned, any activities, be they legal or illegal- and many of them may be highly objectionable and may be intended to develop, perhaps later, into illegal activities- may well be activities which ought to be under surveillance and ought to be considered as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> by this organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* The industrial action that I talked about which has been taken by the Transport Workers Union in New South Wales in the past has not been classified as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and it wants to know whether it will be classified as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> under this clause. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* If we take the proper literary and grammatical interpretation of this clause we must come to the conclusion, as  Senator Sibraa  indicated, that unions, for example, can be accused of engaging in <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* It opens up the definition of subversion in such a way that it can be directed against groups and individuals in the community who, in our view anyway, should not be characterised as <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49)

* The person who will be applying these definitions is primarily none other than the Attorney-General himself in the exercise of his powers, in conjunction with the Director-General, under this legislation- in particular, his powers to issue warrants for electronic surveillance, search and seizure and so on of people who can be characterised as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> according to these definitions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49)

* But I would not wish- and I would be very grateful to get the views of the AttorneyGeneral on this-that kind of contribution to public dialogue, however unattractive it may be to be treated as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and such as to bring into operation all the procedures provided for in this Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49)

* Again, I ask the Attorney-General whether it would not be a reasonable, not a stretched or strained application of this language in subclause (c) as it reads at the moment, to have it applicable to the industrial arena so as to expose the industrial disputants in question- of whom there is always a litter on the scene at any given time- to characterisation as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and thus being within the operation of this Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57)

* The greater the accountability, the tighter the definition of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity, the more readily the Opposition might have accepted the exercise of powers as contained in the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45)

* But because of the Government's rejection of our accountability proposals, because of the Government's rejection of our suggestion for the tightening of the definition of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity, the Opposition feels obliged to say to the Attorney-General that when warrants are issued to carry out a search of premises of Australian citizens who are not guilty of offences, to open their mail and to intercept telephonic communications, the Attorney ought to satisfy himself that every alternative legal and practicable step has been taken to obtain the information which is sought.
