* I want to give honourable members a few brief facts in explanation and proof of this claim and I want to remind Queenslanders to look behind the facade, to look behind the false front of respectability, of interest and concern for Queensland people put forward by the Premier, and see what the real facts are, because if they return a National Party-led coalition government in the Queensland elections on 7 December they will in fact have elected the political front for that sinister, <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, insidious organisation, the League of Rights.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0)

* Perhaps he is trying to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> in order to make people rather dubious about investing their money in Australia and to make them think that if ever there is another change of government there will be the quick implementation of Labor's policy of nationalising the coal industry in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0)

* That this House censures the honourable member for Oxley for his recent economically <span class="highlight">subversive</span> public statements which, contrary to the accepted traditions of the Parliament, speculated upon the standing and strength of the Australian dollar upon which the economy of this nation is based, encouraged the likelihood of a major capital outflow from Australia as the direct result of his persistent predictions of an impending devaluation and as a result sought to damage Australia's economic and financial credibility in the eyes of the world at a time when the honourable member for Oxley knew or ought to have known that Australia was in the process of negotiating for overseas loans.

* In very simple terms, that means that people like myself, and indeed my children and the children of other Australians, will have to pay the interest bill on the loans which have been increased as a direct result of the irresponsible, <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and economically sabotaging statements of the honourable member for Oxley.

* His  statements were economically <span class="highlight">subversive</span>; they sabotaged the determination of this Government to defend the dollar; they have impaired our economic and financial credibility in the eyes of the world, and they have cast on this generation and future generations a burden to repay the additional loans which are now going to be made necessary because he chose to play politics with this nation's most precious possession in economic terms, namely, the Australian dollar. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2)

* It will give this House an opportunity to indicate to the Australian nation that this House is not prepared to tolerate people playing politics with the Australian dollar; that this House and this nation are not prepared to tolerate politicians who make economically <span class="highlight">subversive</span> statements; that this House and this nation are not prepared to tolerate politicians who are prepared to sabotage Australia when it is saying to the world that it requires a loan to defend its currency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2)

* I second my colleague's motion of censure of the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  for his irresponsible, not to say, <span class="highlight">subversive</span> comments directed at undermining the strength of the Australian dollar.

* -They were <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of the economic strategy of this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2)

* These reasons could be unrelated to any speculation of the kind that the honourable member for Oxley so mischievously and in an obviously <span class="highlight">subversive</span> fashion has been seeking to promote throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0)

* On Tuesday of this week I had moved a censure motion against the honourable member for Oxley for making statements which, in the terms of the motion, were economically <span class="highlight">subversive</span>.

* -The honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  has done so much recently by irresponsible, not to say <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, statements to undermine the Australian dollar. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29)

* That is why I said on Tuesday-I repeat it today-that what he is doing is deliberately <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of the Government's economic strategy and to the extent that he should succeed-he will not- of the whole Australian economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29)

* That this House censures the honourable member for Oxley for his recent economically <span class="highlight">subversive</span> public statements which, contrary to the accepted traditions of the Parliament, speculated upon the standing and strength of the Australian dollar upon which the economy of this nation is based, encouraged the likelihood of a major capital outflow from Australia as the direct result of his persistent predictions of an impending devaluation and as a result sought to damage Australia's economic and financial credibility in the eyes of the world at a rime when the honourable member for Oxley knew or ought to have known that Australia was in the process of negotiating for overseas loans.

* A union dispute on the waterfront about a vessel being a health hazard because it had not been fumigated could be interpreted by somebody to be in some way, remote as the dispute may be from <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity, to be hindering the performance of the Defence Force because the vessel is being used for carrying supplies somewhere up north.

* Under that decision, if it were enacted by a Labor government, the Security Intelligence Organisation would be quite restrained specifically by this clause from taking note of activities which could be absolutely <span class="highlight">subversive</span> because of the particular quirk of the government of the day as to what it regarded as legal or illegal.

* For example, in the report of  Mr Justice  Hope the second definition of 'subversion' is given as overthrow by force and undermining by unlawful means and the definition of '<span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity ' is given as overthrow of the Constitution by revolution or sabotage, overthrow by force or violence and destruction of Commonwealth property.
