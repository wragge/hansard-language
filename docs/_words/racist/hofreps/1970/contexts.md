* The simple, blunt truth is that the Minister and his Government, and particularly its leaders, rubbish negotiations - whether they are 'one-sided' proposals from the Pathet Lao or, to quote the Prime Minister, these things called peace talks in Paris' - because of an attitude of mind which represents a hankering for vanished supremacies, a nostalgia of a distinctly <span class="highlight">racist</span> cast.

* The decision by the Secretary of State,  Mr Rogers,  to close down the American consulate in Salisbury reflects the strength of feeling among America's 25 million negroes on this issue and on any issue involving the <span class="highlight">racist</span> policies of South Africa and Rhodesia.

* What disturbs me, however, is that it has never repudiated publicly those members within its own ranks who go past the Government's official1 stance and actively campaign both at home and abroad for a closer relationship and who champion the cause of these regimes in every public or private forum available and who tend to confirm the view that Australia is a <span class="highlight">racist</span> country.

* Well, why does the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  accuse the Minister for the Navy  (Mr Killen)  and me of being <span class="highlight">racist</span> because wc go to see what is happening in South Africa, but say nothing about he honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  and a Labor Party senator visiting South [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0)

* If that is talking like a Communist front, then I atn a Communist and the honourable member for Boothby can similarly be judged to be a <span class="highlight">racist</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0)

* It is impossible to have fruitful relations with the Commonwealth of Nations - including Malaysia, Singapore and India and all those on the islands and shores of the Indian Ocean - if we persist in a nostalgic hankering for military collaboration with the <span class="highlight">racist</span> regimes of Southern Africa. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35)

* Australia's initiatives produced the Suez affair in 1956, an automatic Australian reflex action in defence of imaginary jugular veins, lifelines and vital routes without which our economy would be gravely damaged, demonstrating how deep in the thinking of the older Australian generation are imperialist and <span class="highlight">racist</span> assumptions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Government of Ghana would regard such action by the British Government as a <span class="highlight">racist</span> alignment with South Africa and an  unfortunate  disregard for the susceptibilities of so many African States in Africa whose goodwill and friendship towards Britain have sustained the British presence in Africa over many years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29)

* Whatever the short term advantages the British Government might hope to derive from the resumption of sale of arms to South Africa or from any such conciliatory posture in its dealings with the present <span class="highlight">racist</span> regimes in Southern Africa  could  nol be compared with the long-term benefits which the British people might gain in their relations wilh so many other African States.

* On the one hand we have the Aboriginal people who have been deprived for years; not on <span class="highlight">racist</span> grounds, generally speaking, but in fact they have been deprived and so it looks like that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23)

* If a demonstration was held in front of an Australian legation or consulate overseas and it was claimed that we were <span class="highlight">racist</span> or that we followed policies similar to South Africa, not only would we consider such statements wrong, we would also consider them offensive.

* The truth of the matter,  Mr Speaker,  is that this Government is so concerned with the dissent within its ranks, is so embarrassed by its close association with the Fascist policies of the <span class="highlight">racist</span> governments of southern Africa, so confused by the shambles of its administration - as manifested in the Fill fiasco, the plight of our pensioners and the depression of rural Australia - and so terrified at the prospect of running out of Communists that it has become paranoically pre-occupied with its own survival.

* We believe that Australia's national reputation has been damaged because many of its policies are interpreted as <span class="highlight">racist</span> - I refer to those on immigration, Aboriginals and New Guinea, just to name a few - but primarily we believe that it is wrong to play sport against a team which deliberately excludes players of a different colour.

* We sincerely hope that the people of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Japan are sophisticated enough to distinguish between our Government's real reasons and its public relations reasons; that the coloured people who are much more important to our future than all the Afrikaaner in South Africa can detect the difference between racists and political opportunists. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0)

* And we must do all in our power to persuade  Mr McMahon  that Australia's token opposition to South African racism must be consistent and effective, that because of his mistake the world now sees Australia as permissively <span class="highlight">racist</span> - and that would be the most charitable impression of us in the capitals of Asia.

* This is something which needs to be emphasised and repeated again and again, until people from all oyer the world will realise that Australia's immigration policy is not a <span class="highlight">racist</span> one bat, like those of most other countries, is a selective one.

* The Communist controlled unionists, the so-called peace movements, Maoists, Trotskyites and left-wingers generally are hellbent on dividing the Australian nation on <span class="highlight">racist</span> issues, using the 144,000 part Aborigines and full blood Aborigines as a launching pad for their own motives.

* 
 Mr Speaker, the LiberalCountry Party recently has been under very serious charges of infiltration from an extreme right-wing <span class="highlight">racist</span>, anti-semitic group known as the League of Rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0)

* Last year the League of Rights played on dormant <span class="highlight">racist</span> feelings in the community by its overt support of the South African sporting teams and it attempted to gain some political mileage over minor changes in the Labor Party's immigration policy.

* Not content with rubbishing his own Government in the strongest possible terms, he went on to reflect in a quite despicable and <span class="highlight">racist</span> fashion on 2 private citizens whose only fault was that they tried to give the Government a hand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0)

* My experience is that these delegates almost universally had formed the view that not only are we not racists in Australia, but that we are one of the least <span class="highlight">racist</span> countries that they have visited. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0)

* This seemed to be something of a surprise to some of them because every time this kind of motion is launched by the Opposition, around the headlines of the world goes the suggestion from responsible people in Australia that we are racists, and then those who have not visited this country or studied our immigration laws get an impression. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0)

* They come here with an impression that we are <span class="highlight">racist</span> and it is only when they visit this country that they find we are not. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0)

* But under the influence of 100 or so extremists it has become not only a movement for an independent government but for a government modelled on the Pavelic regime of 1941 to 1944, and inspired by <span class="highlight">racist</span> aims.

* I doubt whether anyone here is consciously and deliberately <span class="highlight">racist</span>, but Government supporters are willing to tolerate them for political expediency because they want to win the votes of extreme right wing migrant organisations and others in Australia which are prepared to support them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0)

* Such an attitude is not <span class="highlight">racist</span>, since it is based not on racial bigotry or superiority, [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0)

* Firstly, I want to deal with what was said by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  who made a ridiculous and <span class="highlight">racist</span> speech in the House today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0)

* But it is not surprising, because  Mr Robert  S. Clark - who runs one of the most <span class="highlight">racist</span> organisations in this country, the Immigration Control Association, and who mainly specialises in helping the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  to beat  Mr St  John for representation in this Parliament - is a prominent member of the Liberal Party in the electorate of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and one of his most prominent helpers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0)

* Yet in this one in relation to Germaine Greer there is undue sensitivity, I suppose, to matters pf sex which one does not always find in relation to <span class="highlight">racist</span> propaganda. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-35-0)
