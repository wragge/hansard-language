* Some of the important reasons why this question has to be tackled with competence and foresight in Australia are as follows: Firstly, the country is large and any energy resources are unevenly distributed geographically; secondly, primary energy consumption is increasing at an annual rate of 6 per cent compared with about 3 per cent for the rest of the world; thirdly, electricity consumption is increasing at the rate of about 9.S per cent per annum compared with 5 or 6 per cent for the rest of the world; fourthly, a high rate of industrialisation and development is taking place in Australia; fifthly, a major exporter of energy resources needs to review periodically its resources and pattern of use to ensure that adequate reserves are retained for domestic use; sixthly, State fuel resources and energy consumption can no longer be considered in isolation - for example, natural gas and proposed interstate transmission lines; seventhly, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and pollution aspects of fuel and energy production and utilisation are becoming of much greater concern to governments and communities; and eighthly, economic benefits may accrue to the nation by control of energy usage patterns - for example, incentives to reduce heavy fuel oil imports.

* I should like to suggest that the Ministry for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts - this Ministry which is very ambiguous in many respects and which from the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standpoint hardly seems to have come down to any positive line of objectivity - should start to accept some responsibility in this regard.

* The most far-reaching may well be the growing public interest in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> quality, which may lead to the rejection of the motor car as the universal symbol of individual freedom and the adoption of less time-wasting relationships between home and work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0)

* Another factor which will emerge in my judgment is that, although heavy initial investment in new centres will be required, in the longer term this will prove to be more a re-deployment of funds rather than the provision of huge additional expenditures, because undoubtedly the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and pollution problems and the transport and traffic problems of the growing metropolitan complexes are in themselves providing a tremendous bill to the people - the taxpayers.

* Considering that the Conservation Foundation and various branches of that body are likely at any stage to be quite significant critics of any government which cannot be seen to be doing enough in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> sense, I think this is a significant contribution and it is  a  significant indication of the Government's intentions in the field. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55)

* I suppose it is fair to say now that the much criticised, in some ways, impact statements are in fact a very considerable move in the direction of a national framework for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> awareness and action.

* All this leads to my second warning, and this ls specifically directed at those who see the cause of our problems as being the growth economy and the onward march of science and technology and who advocate as a cure the restriction or abolition of our dependence on technology, the cutting bask of an economy based on growth and the introduction of extremely harsh <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation.

* One of the virtues of utilising the Camp Hill site, which as all honourable members know but the public at large may not know is the site immediately behind this Parliament House - the King O'Malley site and I think, the area where the King O'Malley memorial is located - as against the Capital Hill site is that Capital Hill will be left with all its <span class="highlight">environmental</span> virtues, its softness and its greenness which Canberra deserves.

* The first prong should be the commencement on an annual basis of selected regional growth centres to accommodate up to 300,000 people each throughout Australia away from the existing cities; secondly, there should be metropolitan redevelopment to help overcome problems of population and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pressures in the major cities; thirdly, the provision of general incentives and subsidies to assist country areas to overcome their existing economic disadvantages to industry, commerce and investment and also the social disadvantages for the people; and the fourth prong is that State governments should be given every encouragement to continue with their selective support in country towns generally to maintain a healthy and viable growth rate in those towns.

* It is the thinking of many well informed environmentalists around the world that it is probably better to allow mining to take place where there is mineralisation and where it may be considered to be in the national interest provided the mining is undertaken according to very strict guidelines and under the codes of the plans of management.

* However, before any consideration is given to the possibility of mining I think it should be mandatory that those who are going to take part in the mining exercise, whether it be done by the proposed Petroleum and Minerals Authority, by private enterprise or in association with an authority of the Australian Government, should undertake an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment to ascertain the likely effect upon the environment within that park and the area adjacent thereto.

* The purpose of this separate legislation, which with a bit of luck we may debate later today or tomorrow, is to ensure that anything that is considered of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance, and quite clearly mining in a national park in anyone's estimate would be environmentally significant, in which the Australian Government has a say and for which it is responsible- and unfortunately we can only hope that the States will follow this lead because we cannot impose anything upon them- will be subject quite apart from the plan of management which will have gone through the whole vetting process which has been discussed, to our <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill, which will insist that an EIS or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study be drawn up.

* The nation's first few <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements have been released so that we can decide, with a reasonable amount of confidence, whether they are worth the time and expense which is involved in their preparation and, more importantly, whether they will be an adequate vehicle for bringing <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations into the processes of government decision making.

* I emphasise that the aim, desire and hope of the Government is that when major development proposals are being considered it will be just as logical for business, for a government authority or a government department to make an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment as it is to make a feasibility study.

* Few people could disagree with the statements of the Minister in his second reading speech when he refers to the virtues of legislation of this type, as distinct from this Bill, and its clauses, and one could be very much inclined to accept the view that to speak about the environment and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences when we are looking at important developments, is almost the same as speaking 10 years ago about the virtues of the family and family life.

* We aim through this Bill to protect the environment in 2 ways; firstly, by use of the information obtained in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessments themselves- the factors threatened, the alternatives and the best course to follow having in mind a full consideration of all factors involved; secondly, by the educative process inherent in public hearings that may be held in association with the preparation of assessments.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0)

* We hope that, unlike the past when economic considerations were the prime considerations that influenced the decision-making process, in the future consideration of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of proposals will take place along with the consideration of the economic features, hand in hand: that is, a parallel process, a marrying of the econ. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0)

* Thus it is expected that as experience in the use of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment technique develops, a decision on whether or not a proposal should be the subject of an impact statement will become a relatively simple matter and the preparation of the statement will be part and parcel of any initial consideration of a proposal.

* That not only entailed the abolition of many positions in the former Department of the Environment, but also meant that the role the Federal Government was playing in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters had decreased.

* Government to appoint commissioners to the Heritage Commission, the low priority it has given to the preservation of the National Estate as evidenced by the budgetary measures announced 10 days ago, and its failure to appropriate any money at all for the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Supply Bills last week are just a few of the other reasons why all Australians must doubt this Government's integrity on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* One of the other more startling actions of this Government in relation to the environment, and a matter which is indirectly related to the subject of the debate today, was its high-handed action in directing  Mr Justice  Fox to complete the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry by May this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* It is my opinion that this Government not only does not have any commitment to the preservation and improvement of the natural and built environment but also does not even understand the most important <span class="highlight">environmental</span> Act it has to administer.

* The enactment of this legislation by the Whitlam Labor Government is the only example of formalising <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment requirements into statuterequirements that most Australians want followed, not ignored. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* There is no dispute over whether British Airways, through its agents, was prepared to comply with the requirements of that legislation It in fact submitted its draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement to the appropriate Minister late last year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* In a letter to the Minister for Transport the proponent's Australian agent said, among other things, that the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement would have only minor editorial changes to that submitted originally as a draft and that it was its intention to prepare an addendum to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement which would be its reply to the comments received as a result of the public circulation of the draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement earlier this year.

* In point of fact, y saying that the Minister has said that it is pointless to follow the requirements of the legislation; it is pointless to take into account the views of responsible Australians who fear the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> damage that Concorde may bring. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* First of all, as the honourable member for Reid said, the British Government, the British Aircraft Corporation and British Airways produced a draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on Concorde operations in Australia dated December 1975. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* This is the Act that the honourable member for Reid says was not followed-  on the necessity or otherwise of holding a public <span class="highlight">environmental</span> enquiry on the operation of the Concorde aircraft into Australia, in particular to Tullamarine Airport. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* I agree that the key <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem for Australia, insofar as it can be determined at this time, is the noise impacts in the vicinity of Tullamarine and upon occasion at any alternate airport to which the aircraft might be diverted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* I am writing to confirm the agreement we have reached today following our consultation in accordance with the Administrative Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974-75 on the necessity or otherwise of holding a public <span class="highlight">environmental</span> enquiry on the operation of the Concorde aircraft into Australia, in particular to Tullamarine Airport. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* Setting this aspect aside, the wider consequences on the global environment have been well canvassed in enquiries in other countries and at this time I do not believe that further knowledge would be gained by traversing these issues again in an Australian <span class="highlight">environmental</span> enquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* In summary, in the light of the foregoing observations, I agree with your contention that a public enquiry is not warranted and I am prepared to recommend to the Government that Concorde operations into Australia in the form described in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement be not opposed on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds subject to: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* If account is taken of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and the decision can be made that it can come here on its trial run, the sooner we can let the British know about it the better. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* It seemed to me that as nothing in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> terms stood in the way it was proper that the British be advised as soon as possible of our decision to allow Concorde to come to Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* The letter, whether from our Department or the British Department, indicated that the proponents of Concorde, British Airways and Air France, had been asked to prepare a final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* In other words, no such final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is yet available, at least not at the time the letter was written. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* In addition, the Department informed our Minister that an addendum to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement would be prepared by it and it would reply to the comments received as a result of the public circulation of the draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* The fact that the United Kingdom and the United States of America required an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement would confirm that our own legislation is not excessive on this score. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0)

* Next, in section 6 it is indicated that, in order to fulfil this requirement to examine fully and take into account <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects, certain administrative procedures must be followed.

* Section 8 (b) indicates that each Minister shall do all that is necessary, consistent with relevant laws, 'for ensuring that any final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement'- I emphasise the words 'final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement'- 'formulated in accordance with those procedures, and any suggestions or recommendations made in accordance with those procedures, are taken into account, in matters to which they relate, in the department administered by him and by any authority of Australia in respect of which he has ministerial responsibilities'.

* In summary, in the light of the foregoing observations-  which really related to whether there would be a public hearing; it was always the Minister's right to deny a public hearing-  1 agree with your contention that a public inquiry is not warranted and I am prepared to recommend to the Government that Concorde operations into Australia in the form described in the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement be not opposed .

* The real reason that Prime Minister McMahon, the Prime Minister of the day, cancelled the project was that the experts- the same experts who are being quoted now in relation to the disposal of nuclear wastecould not decide on the type of reactor that was required; did not know what <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects it would have on Jervis Bay; had no idea where the waste was to be disposed of.

 Mr Justice Fox, with his background and experience in this field- so well demonstrated by the breadth and quality of the reports of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry- has indicated that he is prepared to accept this task, a task which is most important for Australia and I venture to say for the wider international community.

* One of the things I should emphasise when referring to the recommendations of the Committee is that this Parliament in its program should not concentrate only on softwood programs but should be willing to consider a similar program for the regeneration of our natural hardwood areas in a way that would ensure the maintenance of forest diversity and a number of other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values.

* I suggest that if honourable members read paragraph 159 of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and in particular sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) and clauses (a) to (1) they will see the common-sense approach of this all party Committee to the sort of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors that we should be talking about.

* I would like an opportunity to say that in my view the people employed in the Forestry Commission who manage the softwood plantations and the hardwood plantations in my electorate are the true conservationists who, in their dealings with both the softwood and the hardwood environment, have always been very careful in their management techniques to take account of any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors that they find could be detrimental.

* Honourable members will recall that in its uranium statements of August 1977, the Government promised to adopt strict <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls and standards in relation to uranium mining in the region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

* As honourable members will know, the role of the Committee is to assist the Supervising Scientist in considering and reviewing standards, practices, and procedures in relation to uranium mining operations, as far as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection is concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

* The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements for Ranger, which reflect fully the recommendations of the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry, are a condition of the authority to mine. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

* I might say that all of these <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements were the subject of quite detailed consideration and discussions during the Government's negotiations with the Northern Land Council, and the Council did indicate its satisfaction with them knowing, of course, that precise standards are to be applied before mining and milling commences, and after adequate research has been done. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

* This will ensure that co-operatively, the Commonwealth and the Territory can implement the strict <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements recommended by the Ranger inquiry, and agreed on by the Government in its uranium decision of August 1977. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

* Finally, I wish to announce that the Government proposes to introduce a levy as a recognition of the special costs of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

* Because the Supervising Scientist and the research institute will be carrying out <span class="highlight">environmental</span> monitoring and research activities specially designed for regulation of uranium mining, the Government has decided that an appropriate levy should be paid by the uranium miners concerned in recognition of the special <span class="highlight">environmental</span> costs involved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0)

* In all, I believe that the Government, through these legislative and administrative arrangements, and the land use controls to be enforced through the national park procedures has established new and significant standards for resource management and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, and that the opportunity is provided for a completely satisfactory reconciliation of the various interests in the region.

* If, for example, it becomes clear in the future that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> restrictions imposed on the Ranger operation by virtue of its authority to mine are too weak, then this legislation would prevent the Government of the day from updating the conditions attached to rnining, despite that newly acquired knowledge.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0)

* The effect of this legislation is that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions placed on uranium which would take this problem into account, conditions which would place some of the responsibility for this problem and its pollution on the beneficiaries of mining, conditions which could be used to influence the use or choice of particular waste disposal technologies, could not be added by a future government without further amendment to the legislation.
