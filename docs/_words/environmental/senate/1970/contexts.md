* If we have the principle accepted, that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors should be considered and that that shall be written into the next agreement as it begins to run which will be in 1976, we can claim that we have really been responsible for a major achievement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51)

* I know that the conservationists - of whom there are many associated with our Party, as there are associated with all political parties; it is a growing movement with developing enthusiasm - will be gratified to see the national recognition in this form and the fact that the Commonwealth has now insisted that, in an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Slates for the provision of money to the States for afforestation, there be a requirement that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors shall be taken into account. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51)

* Discussions took place between  Senator Cotton  and myself - he representing  Sir Reginald  Swartz - in which it was pointed out, I think in quite compelling and convincing terms, that if we were to insert the requirement as was proposed and was executed in the amendment requiring an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study by an independent expert before a reafforestation programme should proceed in terms of the pending agreement, it would involve a number of things. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48)

* However, I think it was not inappropriate that, following the presentation of this Bill and the consideration of it, the Senate should express its insistence and its concern to put on record that it should be a condition precedent to the availability of this money, in terms of the agreement, that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factor, as a matter of agreement and of law, should be considered by State governments which plan to proceed with forestry plantings with money made available under this legislation.

* Before I leave the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factor I wish to remind the House that the Premier said in April before the 1973 election that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> question had been cleared; yet in May 1974, over one year later, a report of his own Government- of course, a report obtained under the pressure of politics in my State- under the heading of Effluents', in part of a very large report of the South Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, said that little information is yet available on the nature and quantities of plant effluents and noise.

* I was addressing myself to the general question which is that it is most important, firstly, at the political level that there is apparently a division within the Labor Party at the State and Federal level as to the intentions of what I thought was a very firmly held precept of the Party and, secondly, that it has been done under cover and that the public, while talking very rightly in South Australia about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> prospects of Redcliffs, should have this sort of thing done on the quiet without being able to answer it publicly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0)

* I ask: Is it not a fact that whilst the trade unions have played an important role in their quest to protect the environment and general quality of life in the working class area of Newport in Victoria, these same unions are simply spearheading a campaign on behalf of numerous <span class="highlight">environmental</span> groups and people living in the immediate and surrounding area of the district in which the Victorian Government is insisting that a new power station be built?

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0)

* A considerable part of the Bill deals with public enquiries into matters of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concern. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0)

* These arrangements provided the public with the minimum opportunity to influence a decision on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0)

* The assessment of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences will be conveyed to Cabinet at the same time as the proposal itself is put to Cabinet for consideration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0)

* Thus we will ensure Cabinet considers the economic, technological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of proposals at the same time, before any decision is taken. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0)

* I refer to a speech that I made earlier this year at the opening of the 1974 Summer School of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Qualities in which I drew attention to the fact that I felt that the River Murray Commission should have a wider representation, a bigger budget and a livelier administration.

* At end of motion, add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory should not have been bypassed and that statutory authorities and voluntary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation groups in the Territory should be directly and continuously involved in the preparation, and review of the plans of management and the administration of parks, reserves and wilderness zones within the Northern Territory. ' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* The only thing I would like to add at this stage is some reference to the amendment which has been moved by  Senator Carrick  to the effect that the Australian Government has in some way bypassed the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and that the statutory authorities and voluntary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation groups in the Territory should be involved in these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2)

* Therefore over recent years the States have passed legislation insisting that where some action is to be taken by a private or other authority there be prepared a document, an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study, and that that document be used by governments in determining whether the particular proposal should go on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0)

* It supports the Council of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Ministers which, when considering procedural matters, agreed on what should be the nature of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study and decided that all statements should assert the need for the particular undertaking, its objective, what alternative means there are to achieve the same ends or goals and what the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact might be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0)

* As I understand it, in America <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies are mandatory before any proceedings are undertaken and the argument about them is taken before courts of law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0)

* I might say, that in respect of Victoria, my departmental officers advise me that already they are relying very considerably on advice received from the Victorian Ministry of Conservation in assessing the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of proposals being developed in that State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0)

* As I have said, this is the first time in Australia that there has been any statutory attempt to go nearly so far in relation to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements as this Bill seeks to go. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* The measure deals not just with pollution, not just with aesthetics, not just with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters in any narrow sense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* It does seem to me that too many persons at least up to date, have taken the view that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters are narrow in their concept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* In other words, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues do not exist in a vacuum; they are related to the planned development of this earth and everything about it for the benefit of man. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* He also- and this I think is an indication of the extent of the burden which he is prepared to assume unto himself- has included in clause 10 a provision that any person, any member of the public whatsoever, may, by notice in writing, require the Minister to inform him in writing as to what action, if any, has been taken, or is proposed, for ensuring consideration of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the matter, and the Minister shall promptly inform the person in writing accordingly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* That being so, it would obviously be a matter of administrative good sense if both governments involved discussed the matter and decided whence the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study would come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I might add that State projects for which Commonwealth financial assistance is sought will also need to be supported by assurances that all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors have been considered and evaluated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I know as far as Victoria is concerned- and this has been borne out in relation to the Newport power station <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection hearings- that the steps which the Victorian Government has taken have subjected the whole machinery of the executive government to the decisions of the Protection Authority and the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Appeals Board. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* I also asked the Minister whether he was aware that this attitude was being taken against a background of exhaustive inquiries into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of such a power station and the fact that those inquiries had been held and that all of them had been resolved in favour of the power station. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2)

* But I suggest that you cannot resolve satisfactorily these <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection questions by simply saying that individuals can be subjected to all sorts of impositions, to coercive powers, because the environment requires that individuals must submit to those powers.

* The aim of decentralisation, if it is to be truly achieved, is to establish areas to which people want to go, spontaneously, and to which, because of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> circumstances and the natural attributes of the area, people have a natural desire to go.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0)

* So the first question I direct to the Minister is: There is a requirement that the State must carry out an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study, but how long will it take and will the results be made public? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0)

* North and South America, regions of enormous wetlands importance, are seemingly tapping their heels, a situation which could have serious consequences because in those continents development pressures are high and, particularly in some South American countries such as Brazil, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> sensitivity and responsibility demonstrably low.

* I do not think that he was referring to this project in particular but he made the general comment, and I think that there would be general agreement with the comment, that in the past many water conservation projects have been spawned in haste without any real investigation as to results which might flow- not just the economic results but especially the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> ones.

* I often think that so much of what might be called the current <span class="highlight">environmental</span> movement was, if not spawned- if that is the right word- certainly given a great deal of assistance and publicity as a result of the work of that Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution.

* Unfortunately,  Mr Virgo  did not add that some of that delay- all of the delay as far as I am aware- arises from the fact that the State roads programs for the future should be covered by a State <span class="highlight">environmental</span> report and that, at that meeting in Melbourne, the required <span class="highlight">environmental</span> report statements did not accompany the roads programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* To recapitulate, the Committee concludes that whilst a number of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems exist, curtailment of the woodchip industry program is not warranted on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds at this time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* Because of the abovementioned <span class="highlight">environmental</span> threats, any indiscriminate extension of clearfelling for woodchips outside the boundaries of present concession and licence areas would be viewed with concern.

* The total <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of woodchip operations cannot be fully assessed at this time because of the large number of inadequately researched factors to be taken into account. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* Empirical observations coupled with experience and some research tend to indicate that, in the short term, present operations in relatively restricted areas are acceptable provided <span class="highlight">environmental</span> prescriptions are observed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* Among other things it recommends that no export licences be issued to new woodchip projects, other than those intending to use only waste from genuine sawlog operations, until such time as the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems outlined in the report are resolved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* It further recommends that renewal of existing export licences or requests for an increase in quantities to be exported be conditional upon meeting various criteria, including effective implementation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures, assurance of adequate regeneration, and conservation of soil nutrients. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58)

* It will be recalled that, following the release of the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, the Government announced in the House on 1 1 November 1 976 that it supported the Inquiry's view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on uranium exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* As the Government has repeatedly emphasised, this remains a matter for consideration following receipt of the final report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* In this respect the Government's policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry in its first report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* This requirement is additional to those recommended by the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry in its first report and reflects similar concerns to those expressed by the Inquiry in relation to reprocessing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* For this reason, although the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry in its first report did not make a recommendation on this matter, the Government has decided that it is desirable that, as a standard practice, a clause should be included in any future contracts for the export of uranium from Australia noting that the transaction is subject to safeguards as agreed between the importing country and the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0)

* The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects and the long production and hence planning period, strengthen the need for a good information basis for decision making in this industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* On the other hand with respect to both the economic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects, the gaps are large. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* These could be filled by the collaborative efforts of organisations such as the BAE, State Forestry Commissions, the Forestry and Timber Bureau, the Bureau of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Studies and by sponsored university research. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* Although marketing and economic viability are important areas of research in this industry, there are also important questions such as the number of people who are employed in the industry or who are likely to be employed in the industry in the future; the economic viability of the towns and the districts that substantially rely on the economic viability of the industry; the workers who are engaged in the industry and their problems; the unique characteristics of the industry, such as its relative inflexibility with the standard growth periods of 20 to 30 years; the value of the industry in providing regional and economic stability, because of its relative inflexibility; the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls that affect the development of the industry; the industry's value in respect of industry decentralisation; and the strategic and long-term economic planning for the industry- for example, the planning and development of the industry in relation to the future needs of housing in Australia.

* The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consideration which was well put forward at that time and which is still held in some sections of the community was that planting of softwood stands in actual fact created a complete dearth of growth underneath the trees; that it increased the runoff and salinity of water in certain areas; and that it brought about a complete depletion of the wildlife and bird life that was associated with that planting.

* I remember that one of the most venerated authorities, in my opinion, on timber in Australia, E. A. Alstergren, suggested that the interest of the environmentalists who put forward that proposition probably was to walk six feet from the exhaust pipes of" their cars when they drove into the forest.

* In brief, the amendments are, firstly, to necessitate a public inquiry before the confirmation of the nuclear codes; secondly, to establish an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection advisory council independent of government control; and, thirdly, to require that codes not be confirmed until after public inquiry and findings have been reported to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I refer to the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, established by the Whitlam Government in 1975, of which  Mr Justice  Fox was appointed  Chairman. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The first Bill, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, flies in the face of recommendations from the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, but the Government has decided to use this as an instrument by which the Atomic Energy Commission can buy into the Ranger project and thus we can keep faith with the Memorandums of Understanding that were laid down by the Whitlam Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* The second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry- the report of  Mr Justice  Fox which  Senator Collard  clearly has not read or has disposed of in his mind as being a totally irrelevant document- stated that the Atomic Energy Act 1953 should not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Thirdly, we believe that there could be a very real conflict of interest- the Fox Commission pointed this outbetween the entrepreneurial or commercial activities of the Atomic Energy Commission and its responsibilities under the Act to supervise local <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* There is a very obvious and clearcut conflict of interest between an organisation or statutory body which is involved in commercial mining, and a body which is responsible for supervising local <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* I might have referred also to clause 14 of the Bill, which allows the Government to suppress any information relating to the performance of companies or government agencies in meeting health, safety or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection standards which are described in the legislation and will be specified in the codes of practice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* There I found 320 scientists from all disciplines who were very concerned about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* They had set about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> monitoring over the preceeding five or more years to determine the way in which mineral development and mining operations should take place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* These create tremendous <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems which are not evident from nuclear power stations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Moreover, the nitrous oxides and other gases that are liberated from conventional power stations pursue a course which takes them to the ozone area and would endanger the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> shield and increase the threat to life in this world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* In conclusion 1 can do no better than to quote from the second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry where it looked at the use of the Atomic Energy Act 1953.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is interesting to note that it was the Whitlam Government that made the decision to carry on with uranium mining in this country; it was the Whitlam Government that drew up the Ranger agreement and entered into partnership with the companies involved; and it was the Whitlam Government that set up the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry in order to discover the best guidelines for the mining and export of uranium. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry- the Fox report- and a whole host of other evidence indicates that the mining of uranium at this point in history can indeed be a very dangerous operation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0)

* The  six  Bills just introduced underline our determination to proceed with uranium development in a carefullyregulated and responsible fashion with full regard for proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and for ensuring the welfare of the Aboriginal people.

* I am not in the slightest degree equipped by education or experience to pass a judgment upon the issues to which  Senator Haines-  adopting the views of others as well as speaking for herselfhas referred with so much concern but I have tried to follow them and I have formed my own judgment in the light of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and the debates that have been held.

* Meanwhile, our lack of knowledge on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of mining can be corrected by means of a local research institute headed by a supervising scientist who would also be  chairman  of a coordinating committee of government, Aboriginal and mining representatives.

* However, we continue our opposition to the three Bills before us now because, although they pur.poit to provide machinery and measures whereby the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and hazardous effects of uranium mining can be controlled and regulated, we find that the provisions are not satisfactory.

* In dealing with the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which concerns a local area, we can see very clearly just how much effort is being put into making sure that there will be <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and protection; that the Government will even go as far as to make sure that those activities are coordinated [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* The Bill to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act will facilitate the establishment of the Kakadu National Park, while the other Bill- the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill- will establish the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0)

* As  Senator Walsh  has pointed out, the effect of the Government's proposed amendments to clauses 1 1 and 1 3 would be to provide that Australia would have a uniform code on nuclear safety and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, only if certain circumstances arose; namely, if the State governments request the Governor-General, and thereby the Commonwealth Government, to proclaim a code in respect of the territorial areas of their States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* I used clause 13 as an illustration because it concerns safety and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* The Opposition's amendment, and indeed all the subsequent amendments which the Opposition proposes to move, relate to the proposal by the Opposition to establish an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection nuclear activities advisory council.

* The Minister for the time being administering the Enviroment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 shall, within 1 month of being furnished with a proposed code of practice, make a direction under sub-section 11(1) of the Act that an inquiry be conducted in respect of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects (if any) of the proposed code, and the provisions of the Act shall apply to that inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36)

* In effect, the Government is saying that there will be no codes relating to the mining or milling of uranium, no minimum standards of safety or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, unless the State governments impose them or unless the State governments agree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* It is wrong, at the time that we are passing a whole lot of Bills which relate to the commencement of the uranium industry in this country, for the Opposition to hold up the legislation unless a uniform code is reached by all States on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* I suggest that the honourable senator, whom I regard quite highly particularly in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters, should read clause 9 of the Bill which allows for these various codes to be disallowed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* I can assure the Minister, who comes from the State of New South Wales, as I do, that there is quite some concern in sections of the mining industry and in the planning and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> areas about this particular clause. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37)

* The fact is that, in that debate, I indicated that the Government had authorised the preparation of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* My advice, which was given a few days ago and which I think is confirmed by my colleague, is exactly as I have just said, namely, that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is due about mid-June. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* The reason I raised this matter in the chamber in the first place is that no <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study has been carried out, except by the organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0)

* For the purpose of procedures approved under this Act and for achieving the object of this Act, the Minister may direct that an inquiry be conducted in respect of all or any of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of a matter referred to in any of the paragraphs of section 5, whether or not the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement has, in accordance with procedures under this Act, been furnished to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0)

* From what the Minister said on the evening of that date, I gather that the Federal Government does propose to intervene and at least to make sure that the financial and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters are looked after. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0)

* The greatest tragedy of all is that there has been no effective <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study and the adjacent wetlands will be ruined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0)

* Two major requirements are foreign investment controls and the need to comply with Federal <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0)

* That policy was based on the findings and recommendations of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry conducted under the  Hon. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* Our policy was decided only after most careful consideration of the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The development of those resources, whilst serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the environment, the welfare of the Aboriginal people and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Minister's approval for the export of uranium from a particular project will be given only after full consideration by the Government following the completion of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> procedures and compliance with the Government's foreign investment policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* The machinery and the procedures I have just outlined will ensure that the Government maintains strong regulation and control over uranium exports in the national interest in a manner consistent with the Government's policy of uranium development announced on 25 August 1977 following receipt of the Report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* However, this Government intends to give the green light to all the producers with the result that Pancontinental is pressing ahead with its plans in the face of major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> objections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0)

* We request that the Government does not make its decision on the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact statement funded by Iwasaki, but to ask you as our representative to demand an inquiry under section 1 1 of the Environental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0)

* Until such time as the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study is carried out and the matter of the introduction of foreign capital is properly investigated this project should not proceed.

* If there were no <span class="highlight">environmental</span> variables to affect wool production we could measure the progress of the parent studs in genetic terms simply by looking at the improvement or otherwise in the average weight of wool cut per head in the entire flock. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0)

* There are, however, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> variables which, in the short term at least, can be much more significant and much more important than any genetic variation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0)

* If there were no <span class="highlight">environmental</span> variables we could say, therefore, that the Australian parent studs have, over most of this period, achieved about that same rate of genetic improvement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0)

* There are, however, a number of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> variables that would have tended to increase wool production regardless of any genetic changes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0)

* At least some of this very modest rate of improvement which has been recorded in the last 40 years is due to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and not genetic factors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0)

* As I understood  Senator Carrick,  and from my own information- I think I am correct- the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on Yeppoon has not yet been received, but it is expected that it will be received about mid-June.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0)

* Whilst the Ranger inquiry produced a fairly in-depth <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study, the other two projects were not subjected to quite the same sort of study and, without being too specific, I know that there was some doubt whether the preparatory work on the others might result in what I call a certain fudging or intrusion into the Fox report concept of the Kakadu National Park.

* It is true to say, and I think it needs to be freely admitted, that the Labor Government decided that this Act was suitable as an initial legislative base for the Ranger venture; but that same Government then set up the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and, I believe, undoubtedly would have acted on the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry to abandon this Act- a recommendation which was based on most cogent considerations which I will outline to the Senate shortly.
