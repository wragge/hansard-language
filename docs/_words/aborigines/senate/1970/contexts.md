* I remember the time in Queensland under that regime when I was working on cattle stations and I had to eat my meals at the woodheap, when cattle station owners treated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with a stirrup iron.

* Dr Everingham  sits in the other place, and his policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland and for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia is that they should all be sterilised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* I wonder whether the Labor Party is just a little bit afraid that perhaps the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might one day build up to such a stage that they will be too many in number for the Labor Party to be able to control and use for political purposes, such as they are using today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* I feel quite sure in my own mind that I as an Aborigine could well fill all the galleries of this Parliament with young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and not so young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if I were inclined to use <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for political purposes as I find the honourable senator from Queensland apparently is doing today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* I think it is one of the great tragedies of life that a man who has been appointed to this Senate, as is the case with  Senator Bonner,  to defend the rights of his people now demonstrates that the only speech that he can make in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is one that attacks somebody who is aligned with the Aboriginal cause. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* This argument on Aboriginal rights will go on in this Parliament whilever this Government is in power because it is only the Australian Labor Party which has a reasonable policy and which can implement it in a reasonable way to give to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the status of human beings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* I appreciate that there are many fine people in that Department, but I want to see all those people whom I have mentioned sacked and disposed of because of the inhuman way they have acted towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been herded onto reserves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* If the honourable senator is happy with that situation I should like him to know that there are at least 29,000 other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland who are not happy with it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* I am sorry that this matter has been raised in such a way as to indicate to many people that there may be disagreement among the people of Australia on the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be regarded. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

 Senator Bonner has referred to the fact that  Dr Everingham  is alleged to have said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be sterilised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* If we are to be accused of that, then I suggest to  Senator Bonner  that he go to his ex-Prime Minister and tell him that he, the ex-Prime Minister, was trying to make the lives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a political issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* It was  Mr Gorton  who said that unless the Queensland Government removed from its statute book some of the discriminatory laws against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> he, as Prime Minister, would be forced to come into the issue and see that those discriminatory provisions were removed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* If anybody in this chamber tonight had done as much to advance the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - particularly those of Queensland - as had  Senator Keeffe  and  Dr Everingham,  then the lives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this Commonwealth would be much better than they are today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* I shall also direct the attention of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  whom I represent, to the matter to see whether anything can be done on  a  basis which acknowledges the rights of people to move to better jobs and, at the same time, to avail themselves of opportunities to establish businesses in this country.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0)

* The question as to whether it was legal for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to camp in their tents on the lawn is, as I understand it from the judgment, irrelevant, anyhow, because as I understand the judgment - I ask the lawyers to correct me if I am wrong - the judges ruled that the Commonwealth, being the owners of the land, had a continuous and full right to remove people from that land under the common law.

* Although I will be trying, to the best of my ability, to bring about a situation where my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have a permanent lobby in Canberra, I do not feel that at this time I can support the motion to disallow the Ordinance because, as I said earlier, it can do no good for my race whatsoever.

* The whole of our attitude !o <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country has moved from a position of initial hostility and oppression and even cruelty in the early days of Australian settlement through a period to one of paternalism from which we are now resiling. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0)

* If we want the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to integrate with our society in the fullest sense of the term, then they must be prepared to integrate, and it is what we should want on the basis of both duty and entitlement.

* Therefore to those who have suggested that in this form of protest they should be accorded a solicitude and a tolerance which is denied to other sections of the community who similarly want to protest on issues which are relevant to their interests in life, I say that once they do that they are putting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a position different from that of the rest of the community; they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on racial integration, they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on toleration and the whole of their thesis on the ultimate integration of the Aboriginal people with the white culture. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0)

* Therefore I say in these last few minutes that those who have supported the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this programme and in this type of protest should have second thoughts about it, to see if by doing that they have not in fact done a great deal of harm to the campaign of these people and to the campaign of the Australian community for the ultimate total absorption of our indigenous people in our culture without any distinctions or differences.

* The second point is whether the Ordinance is a good ordinance, leaving aside the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, or whether it ought to be amended or modified as it applies to the ordinary vehicle and to the lands or camping on them or the holding of circuses and festivals on them.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0)

* In proposing that action be taken on this aspect of the general subject matter, the Committee wishes to emphasise the need to consult the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned in each instance and to encourage them to seek action for the protection of their objects and sites. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0)

* In addition, however, some of the programmes of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs from the $8.045m available to it, after making the proposed States grants, will benefit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Of this amount, $5m will be for the purchase of properties for Aboriginal communities off reserves and $500,000 for grants in association with capital fund loans, as promised by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  in his statement of 26th January, and $2.545m for grants-in-aid for a variety of purposes; and both of these programmes will benefit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Whereas in 1969 there might have been no more than 2,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in secondary schools throughout Australia, by 1972 there are of the order of 8,000, of whom 4,266 were training as at June under the secondary grants scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Funds have been granted to local and other authorities to provide employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on socially valuable projects chosen in accordance with criteria specified by my Office and the Department of Labour and National Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* These projects have enabled shire councils in many rural areas to carry out projects of value to their communities while at the same time providing employment and training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Of course, as honourable senators will already be aware, the whole direction of the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises operated by the Office is to assist suitable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become self-employed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* The housing programmes aim primarily to assist families, whose children will benefit thereby: a great deal of health activity is devoted to improving the health situation of Aboriginal infants and children; the bulk of expenditure in education is, of course, for younger <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; while the employment training scheme and other activities of the Department of Labour and National Service seek in particular to assist schoolleavers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* I think it important to bear in mind that the problems facing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in major towns and cities and those of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in communities on reserves, on pastoral properties and on the fringes of remote townships differ very greatly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* The movement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the major cities has been quite striking over the past decade or 2. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Consequently, we have placed an increasing emphasis on programmes to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in urban areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Either with the State or unilaterally we have provided hostels and houses, supported the Aboriginal health service in South Sydney, provided funds for schooling, pre-schooling and adult education facilities, assisted <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to find and hold employment, and supported the Aboriginal legal service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has stated that he personally is most impressed by the work being done by the Aboriginal medical service in South Sydney, and believes that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> involved are providing a referral or treatment service to numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Sydney metropolitan area who would not at this stage have the necessary confidence to seek treatment in the first instance from the normal community services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* We expect that, as our programmes become more and more effective, the urbanised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will need our assistance less and less. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* There seems little doubt that ample employment is available in the cities: What we seek to do is to remove those handicaps inhibiting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from taking full advantage of this situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* As regards the remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, most of those involved are now living in static communities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* But, if almost all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have abandoned their semi-nomadic hunting and gathering life, this does not mean that the old tribal structures and beliefs have also disappeared. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Their members are finding themselves having to cope with a cash economy, to become accustomed to a radically changed diet and to learn aspects of hygiene not previously relevant in their nomadic exsistence I think we should all try to realise that these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in remote situations are experiencing a difficult period of rapid change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* We should help them develop appropriate kinds of dwellings, such as the house developed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Finke. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* In addition, we have embarked on a far-reaching programme to delineate areas which are of sacred or special significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* I hope that we can, through the provision of relevant education, ensure that members of the remote communities become less and less dependent, while at the same time relating that education more directly to the sorts of employment we will be encouraging the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there to undertake. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0)

* Unless we can find additional, different and meaningful employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in remote communities, we may expect the drift to the cities about which I spoke earlier to accelerate.

* 1 think my initial reaction to this measure, and the attitude of all senators, is that a large sum of money is entailed and that we are entitled to feel that there must be a participation by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the spending of the money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0)

* It may sound strange coming from me with my trade union background, but although  1  have always believed in seniority for the purpose of protecting people when it came to dismissals, nevertheless we may reach a stage when some of the younger people in the Aboriginal community will have to be given positions of responsibility because some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the older age groups will be too cautious or timid and may not have the drive to meet a situation which the younger ones could manage.

* The point I am making is that obviously it is good that because of this Bill <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be able to achieve new skills, but when 1 look at the whole social structure of Australia I come to the conclusion that the Department of Labour and National Service is not so far advanced or so well equipped as it should be to meet the situation.

* Reports reaching us from centres from time to time is the cause for concern and the decision to write you was, that you in your capacity as Minister, would order an inquiry into these allegations and if proved correct, you in your wisdom, will be able to exercise disciplinary measures against those members of the police force who are administering the law against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> incorrectly.

* While it is true special legislation does exist which is applied to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders only in this State, this does not give sufficient reason for police officers when administering the common laws of the State, to act differently when its application is considered necessary against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders.

* I believe the actual lead up to the confrontation of hippies and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the reported incident was something that had occurred days previous between an Aborigine and a couple of hippies, but allegations are that the law had not been enforced correctly which created disharmony between the hippies and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Kuranda, which resulted in the reported incident.

* Our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been forced to live in a primitive environment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* To try to make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> move from that way of life and live in our present day environment would be to court disaster. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* This is one area in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have not been able to keep pace with us, not because they could not do so but because the circumstances of their environment made it imprudent that they should even try. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as they feel more and more the impact of our modern type of civilisation, must face other problems with which they find it most difficult to cope. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* A close study of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their simple environment reveals that they had excellent methods, for example, of maintaining family levels at a standard which was commensurate with their environment and which enabled them to survive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Because of the impact of our type of civilisation on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, their family numbers have expanded out of all proportion to previous family numbers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Those problems affect us and our community almost as much as they affect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or people of part Aboriginal descent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* I have looked very closely at the allocations of the moneys, and 1 notice with great pleasure that the money is to be allocated to overcome some of the real problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly those living in cities and towns. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* It is important that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are given the same opportunities as other Australians in the field of education and housing, and surely there is a real need for more to be done in the field of health than perhaps has been done in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* For many years I have advocated, both at the State and Federal levels, even prior to my becoming involved in politics, that perhaps one of the main solutions to many of the problems facing members of my race is the involvement of competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working in the field. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* This would require finance, but 1 believe that there is a greater need for the involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and I am pleased to note that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant)  has indicated that this is what he intends to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* I have had discussions with many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly in my own State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have applied for positions but unfortunately, because of some misunderstanding or something within the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, many of them have not had the courtesy of even receiving an acknowledgment of their applications. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* So if the present Government is to bring forward policies, I would hope that the policies would be followed through and that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be given the opportunity to work amongst their own people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* I say this because far too often people advocate an overall policy for the cure of all the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* We cannot have an overall policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia today are in varying stages of development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* The answer to the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in, say, northern Queensland would not necessarily be the same as the answer to the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living around Melbourne or Sydney, or even in Townsville and Brisbane. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* So there needs to be more in-depth studies of the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in various areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Today many members of my race suffer what we may term psychological scars because of the destruction of their own customs, traditions and culture and because for far too many years <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were treated perhaps with less esteem than the household pet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* I could give many instances where this has happened, even in my own State of Queensland where perhaps <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been given a better deal than they have in any other State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* All the legislation which is brought forward in relation to education and health will not solve problems unless competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are fielded to liaise with their own people, to ensure that they are sure of their entitlements and where to go to receive them, and how to cope with the many problems they are facing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* I received at least 75 per cent of the total vote cast by all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders living in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* To me that indicates that I certainly have the support of the Aboriginal people in my own State, lt is difficult to obtain any percentages in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not living in communities because they are not identified as such On the rolls. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* As I said previously, I hope that some note will be taken of the employment and the involvement of competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the field of Aboriginal endeavour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* He also said that the infant mortality rate among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was not a scandal - in other words, that we have to live with these sorts of things. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* It is possibly because members of the white community have easier access to facilities for medical treatment, enjoy a higher standard of living and have a diet that is vastly better than that of most black people, even in a State like Victoria where there is only a limited number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Not only has this Bill set out in some ways to overcome the problem but also, I should imagine, when the Budget session of this Parliament takes place we will see an expansion of this Government's policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into ever-widening areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Eventually the Government will produce a Bill discriminating, if you tike, in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* He said that he believes in all sincerity - I think they were the words he used - that Queensland treats its <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders better than any other State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* I hope that he was being facetious because there are still some 30,000 people in Queensland living under the provisions of the infamous <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1972 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1972. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* There has been no real attempt to reduce the incidence of infant mortality and malnutrition; there has been no real attempt to overcome the housing shortage; there has been no real attempt to train <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders in trades and professions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* In fact, if it were not for Commonwealth moneys the State of Queensland, the deep north, would be one of the most shocking in Australia in its treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Mr Bryant,  has tackled the problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* However, I do ask the members of this Senate to contrast the attitudes of this Government towards the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the attitudes adopted in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* If honourable senators would care to have a look at the photographs the Minister has of the conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living and were allowed to live by the previous Government they would realise that  Mr Gordon  Bryant is doing - I believe he will continue to do - a particularly fine job, and he has the full approval of the members of the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Senator Little  said very pertinently that money alone is not a solution to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>' problems and that many other questions are involved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* I find it very pleasing that  Senator Little  has taken a different attitude when speaking to this Bill from that which he took on the previous occasion when he spoke about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and said that he believed they owed a debt of gratitude to the white population of Australia because we had preserved their race which otherwise would have died out. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* The record of events which runs until 7th March shows that no period longer than 5 days elasped when we did not take some action to improve the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* Regarding  Senator Bonner's  criticism of whether the money provided would go where it was needed, that is, whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory would get any of it, the answer is no. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* This is a grant to the States, and of course any assistance afforded to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory or in the Australian Capital Territory must be provided by a separate appropriation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* When speaking of employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and consultation with experts on this question, he claimed himself as an expert who should be consulted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* However, one must consider expertise in every field, and one cannot claim that in this field the colour of one's skin necessarily implies expertise, lt could well be that governments have not accepted  Senator Bonner  because over the years his opinions have differed greatly from those of other honourable senators such as  Senator Keeffe  and  Senator Georges  who have taken a keen interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* At present when officers of my Department are working in any area where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a venture which is producing a product that can be used in a contract being undertaken by my Department, they are required to consult the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on whether that product can be utilised in the contract.

* While 11 houses are being constructed at Gove today, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not making bricks because the bricks cannot be utilised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35)

* The  President  of the Legislative Council,  Mr Greatorex,  is a member of the Country Party as is  Mr Kentish  from Arnhem Land who probably knows more and has a greater background in relation to the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than any other member in the Northern Territory.

* One of the handicaps that the Commonwealth Parliament has to face is that, in spite of the fact that it is a number of years since the 1966 referendum was conducted, the previous Government did not carry out any surveys on health, employment, housing or educational requirements for islanders or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.

* It is a very special quasi-agreement which, as I said 6 years ago, mirrors the kind of treaty one would have expected among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - I say this with great respect to my colleague,  Senator Bonner,  who will know that I am not reflecting in any way upon the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - of 150 years ago.

* If the Government continues its proliferation of bureaucracy in this portfolio and does not get round to dealing with the real issues - treating <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as dignified Australians who are equal to other Australians and not people to be patronised or simply representing a social welfare situation, as New Zealand did with its Maoris for a long while, much to its regret - very soon there will be as many public servants looking after <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as there are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.

* I have no quarrel as to whether a council, which is all black, has the right to issue or withdraw or withhold a permit of that nature, but I have a quarrel with the continuation of 2 Acts- one for Torres Strait Islanders and one for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- which should have been abolished many years ago.

* At an estimates committee meeting neither the Minister nor his officers were able to give any evidence, nor is there any evidence known to me otherwise, which would indicate that the expansion of the housing associations in Queensland in the current year will be sufficiently rapid to ensure that the full funds which will be made available for housing can be properly expended in the coming year to the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland.

* Nobody can be certain at this stage whether Queensland's <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want Commonwealth or State laws. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* For those reasons I move an amendment to the motion for the second reading and to draw attention to the attitude of the Senate in relation to this action of the Government because we believe that it should forthwith make this money available to the Queensland Government so that it can be spent expeditiously in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland.

* In spite of the fact that it is said that there is a so-called advisory council in Queensland, the majority of members of that council have been hand picked in various ways by white people in the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs to make sure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say 'Yes, boss' every time that a proposal is put.

* But the Queensland Department expended the best part of $250,000 of Australian Government funds to build houses, firstly, where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not want them and, secondly, in an area where they will probably have to be shifted because of the type of earth or sand in that area.

* In his Budget the Treasurer provided an amount of $13,552,000 so that in effect  Senator Cavanagh  proposes reducing Queensland's allocation by $3,190,000 in spite of commitments in writing given by him and his Department as well as consultation at officer level which indicated the amount as being for housing for Queensland 's <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* I am greatly concerned over this action by  Senator Cavanagh  as it has now become necessary for me to have my Department carry out an exhaustive investigation of total fundings which at this stage appears to require a drastic reduction in the housing programme activity which must be disastrous not only for the building industry generally in the State, but as well dash the hopes of so many Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for an early relief of their housing problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* It is futile for the  Senator to  claim that he proposes reallocating the money so that Queensland 's <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not be disadvantaged when he is fully aware that his Bill reallocates the amount to other Slates and also that during the past financial year his Department underspent by $9m in the housing section alone, as indicated in the Treasurer's Budget Speech.

* There is no doubt that the visit is designed primarily to endeavour to create unrest and disharmony amongst Aboriginal people, and I would forecast also for party political purposes in view of the election, but especially as a result of a particularly vitriolic attack on him and his department by a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in North Queensland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* As has been pointed out, Queensland has one-third of the total number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia, and the Queensland Government has been housing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> pretty well in many areas which I know pretty well. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* The State Government in Queensland, over a number of years, has accepted responsibility for these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the extent that it provides for these communities in every field- education, health, housing, the whole box and dice of what is required. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* I think that this Bill was introduced originally simply as an attempt to discredit the Queensland Premier- because the Federal Labor Government sees him as its most formidable opponent- at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland, because this Government flew in the face of the expressed wishes of the people of those communities.

* Because the Legal Aid Service offices we set up could not supply counsel for all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> appearing before the courts, rather than employ additional lawyers full time, if they were available, and keeping them on the staff to be employed only at some time or other, there was always the problem that the Department could never budget for the amount required to pay for counsel briefed outside the Legal Aid Service.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83)

* Certainly, the white Australian, if I may use that term although it is a little offensive, has a role to play because we do have some expertise, some skills and some experience which we ought to make available to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if they want it.

* I want to recall that in 1 967 when all three political parties propounded with unanimous voice a proposal to break the nexus between this House and the other place, the people of Australia in nearly all States- I think in 5 States if not six- by a vote approximating 70 per cent renounced the overtures of the trinity, the 3 parties, and under persuasion of some 10 senators, again from 3 parties, they rejected the nexus but overwhelmingly accepted the proposal relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.

* The Housing Commission has gone even further than that because it has removed paling fences from around some of the older homes that have been purchased and rented to Aboriginal people because it said the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will pull all the palings off and use them for firewood; but that is not true at all because many of those homes do not even have wood stoves.

* If the local bylaws and ordinances allow a front fence to be built quite obviously the kiddies could play at the front of the house without their mother's fearing that the kiddies will run out on to the street into traffic; but apparently it is all right so long as the kiddy is black as he is allowed to run out onto the street and to be run over by a passing car because the housing association believes in this policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.

* One of the problems facing  Senator Colston  in interpreting the figures is that they are given in 2 categories- the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on study grants as at 30 June of a year, and the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on study grants as at 3 1 December of a year.

* Does the statement yesterday by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in which he urged top level businessmen to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a bid to reduce unemployment, indicate that this Government, under its federalism approach to governing, has now abdicated its responsibility to the Aboriginal people of this country and, as with everything else, is leaving it all to so-called private enterprise?

* It is the power vested in this Act that enables the Minister of the Queensland Government to ride roughshod over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State and in the case of Aurukun and Mornington Island to take over the church missions without consultation with the Aboriginal people themselves.

* It does seem to run counter to the more modern trends of administration of aboriginal affairs, in particular policies of self management, which are directed to putting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the first time in a position where they can manage their own affairs, make decisions for themselves rather than being managed by government.

* It is in the light of those sorts of conditions and in the light of all the theory that exists in Australia about our responsibilities to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that we believe that the Senate should, as a place of review and as a place where independence of thought is expressed from time to time, accept responsibility and put on record a request to the national Government to assume its rightful responsibilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0)

* That agreement can come only with the assistance of those who have given counsel to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the whole of this century- it was 1902 when the Christian Church went to that area- and who have built up respect and leadership in the area for many years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0)

* Perhaps we ought to look at the background of the two communities about which we are talking to see what the problems are and to see how they can be overcome by working together and seeing that self-management of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is the factor on which we place primary importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0)

* For these reasons it is a matter of primary importance to the Federal Government, and I give my assurance to the Senate that the Federal Government is treating this as a matter of urgency- certainly as a matter of public importance- and we hope that the solution which is achieved to this problem will be of long and distinct benefit to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0)

* Having said that, I accept that in this area the major Commonwealth responsibility for Aboriginal welfare and the maintenance of the main thrust of that policy, which is to have a system whereby <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are given more and more chance to manage their own affairs, is something that we must pay heed to and be prepared to act to protect if necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0)

* Arising out of all the discussions that have been held and the views that have been expressed in the past day or two, I believe, there is strong support for the right of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to express the way they wish to see their communities develop.

* The view of the Government is that it wishes to see self-determination by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, with assistance from government and community bodies to see that their health, welfare and development are such as to make them equal citizens and make the Government proud of what they are able to accomplish. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0)

* I believe that the Prime Minister,  Mr Viner,  other members of the Government and members of the Senate are at this stage all working towards fulfilment of the hope that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the two communities concerned will, through the national discussion of their situation, develop further and so enhance their prospects in the future.

* I will check the matter that has been raised by  Senator Cavanagh  today and will provide him with whatever further information is available, but from time to time I have answered questions and taken action to ensure that officers have been made available to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine their eligibility for unemployment benefits and other payments through the Department of Social Security.

* I will seek guidance from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on the plans he has for future development of such schemes, but I do think it is fair to say that the experience that has been gained by conducting these programs has shown them to be of benefit to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to provide, in remote communities a means of employment which otherwise would not exist. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0)

* But what has occurred in the limited number of communities which I mentioned yesterday is that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have sought, as an alternative to the payment of individual unemployment benefits, an employment scheme which would give that community the equivalent of what the adult members of the community, the working population, would receive in the way of unemployment benefits. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0)

* I now ask the Minister whether she will cause an immediate inquiry to be instituted with a view to ensuring that the Aboriginal community land at Herberton is left intact for the use of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0)

* The Queensland legislation- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the regulations and by-laws made under themprovide that officials, as well as Aboriginal and Island Councils, manage the affairs of reserve communities and the officials have the overriding power and responsibility.

* It does not give me any pleasure whatsoever to come to the conclusion that the misuse of power in Queensland that we have seen in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is no more than a symptom of a malaise in government generally within that State.

* I agree with the policy of the Government on Aboriginal land rights in as much as we recognise that fundamental to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>' sense of aboriginality is their affinity with one another and their affinity with the land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* It is recognised that in several areas of Australia the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>' claims to these lands are undeniable and must be accepted in law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* The permit system enables <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine who enters their house because they regard their land as their house. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* I have no doubt about the type of action pursued by the Queensland Government, such as the ludicrous and disgusting Aurukun Associates Act which greedily undermines the rights of the Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to share in the decisionmaking in relation to rnining in that area or to receive just compensation for the mining in their tribal area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* If the Government feels that it has to rush the legislation through because we cannot trust the Queensland Premier, how can it say that only with the co-operation of the Queensland Government will the legislation be successful and will there be any benefit to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders resident in settlements in that State? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* It seems to us that the Prime Minister has demonstrated to the Australian public and to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the insincerity of the position in which he says he holds the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> 'own elected body. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* Since it came to office  2%  years ago the Fraser Government has concluded a series of arrangements with the Queensland Premier which have had the effect of denying Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders the basic rights which are enjoyed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> resident in other States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* The current Bill will provide <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland with the powers of exclusion in relation to who enters their reserves, but it fails fundamentally- and this is one of our points of contention- in that it does not provide them with the power to exclude individuals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0)

* These fundamental points in this legislationthe failure to explicitly set aside land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; the abject failure to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders full rights to exclude from entering the community individuals and groups whom they may feel to be detrimental to the community; the failure of the by-laws to cover Europeans generally or adequately and the rather complicated procedure in relation to the enactment of by-laws -are similar to many of the more paternalistic overtones of the Queensland legislation.

* I have here copies of some documents, including a copy of that speech made by  Mr Porter,  and a copy of some correspondence and other documents which relate, firstly, to this matter of whether the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves wanted the State Government to take over their missions; secondly, whether the churches wanted the State Government to take over the missions; and, thirdly, just what it is that the State Government, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the churches have been saying to one another.

* Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an article in today's  Courier-Mail  which reports  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  as having said that the Uniting Church in Australia would remain to give pastoral care to Aurukun and Mornington Island <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but it was not expected to have administative control as at present? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0)

* It seems to me, speaking on behalf of my colleagues, that  Mr Viner  and  Mr Nixon  have broken their word to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that the assurances that were given to me by the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this place,  Senator Guilfoyle,  in the debate that took place several weeks ago, have now been put aside. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0)

* It has cast a pall of gloom over all those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in communities in Queensland who felt that they had an advocate in the Senate, who felt that they had an advocate in  Senator Bonner  and his colleagues and who felt that they had an advocate in the Prime Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0)

* One can come to the conclusion only that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland have been betrayed as a result of this agreement which can only be described as infamous and denying justice at the very point in time when we felt that the principles of self-management were going to be applied, in the first instance to Mornington Island and Aurukun. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0)

* We thought that, despite our criticisms, the passage of the Bill last Friday would have established beyond all reasonable doubt the very important principles of self-management for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0)

* The 1975 policy statement of the coalition parties indicated that the parties recognise "the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory" and included a commitment "to make lands available, either by grant or through the provision of funds, to tribal Aboriginals living on or near their traditional areas which are not on reserves and to detribalised Aboriginals in rural or urban areas".

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0)

* If the honourable senator is claiming that there has been racial discrimination against the 40 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned, I am sure that the Racial Discrimination Act would provide some basis for reporting that incident to the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations.

* The Government has decided to proceed with legislation to free Aboriginals on Queensland reserves from the provisions of the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Acts which give State officials overriding powers over the management of communities on Aboriginal and Islander reserves.

* The Victorian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League questions the ability and sincerity of the Federal Government in coming to a satisfactory agreement with the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities on the question of the land rights and self management. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* He spoke for a large group of people and indicated that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanted land rights and nothing less than that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* The legislation will take away a lot of the rights which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rather dubiously hold now under the present legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* But why should we expect the powers which the Queensland Government will retain under the proposed legislation to be exercised any less discriminatorily than the powers it has under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act are exercised? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* The only way that term is applicable is that through that legislation the State Government, in collaboration with the Federal Government, is taking away land from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in these two communities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* To suggest that the Federal Government is attempting to take away the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those communities is quite contrary to the whole movement being made by the Federal Government to ensure that the right of self-determination of those two communities is assured. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* I want to assure the people who have been engaged in discussions on this matter, whether they be members of the Church which has given support to the communities, members of the communities concerned or Aboriginal leaders, that there is very great support for them in the Government with regard to their objectives and their wishes to determine their own future and to accept the responsibilities of running their communities in a way that will be of benefit to all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are living in them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* A confrontation can work only to the detriment of all those who are seeking one common end; that is, the opportunity for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to live in these communities in the way in which they determine and for the support of government, the Church and other groups which want to work for their benefit to be maximised to the greatest degree possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* The Commonwealth Government intervened originally because it had the strong belief that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not want to be taken over by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* The agreement provided for security of tenure in a long term lease, guaranteeing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> traditional land rights and securing their right to the use and occupation of the land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* I think the negotiations that were part of the chronology of events that I listed show that the consultation between  Mr Viner  and the Church and the Aboriginal communities is one that allowed us on 11 April to believe that this agreement was in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and would be acceptable to all those who have been involved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* I believe that if we are working towards the advancement of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and we are seeking to help them to determine the way in which they will live in the future, co-operation in achieving those ends would be the better way of dealing with the matter, rather than to talk at this stage, and on this day, of the failure of the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* I ask all those who are dealing with this matter on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the leaders of the communities to accept the commitment that has been given time and time again by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, by the Prime Minister and by other members of the Government, that if the legislation which is introduced and the terms of the leases which are to be offered are not acceptable to the community and are not in accordance with the agreement that was made on 11 April the Commonwealth Government will then consider the position and deal with the matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* Two months in which we can change the nature of the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will live in Queensland in the future seems to me to be a very short period of time, given the energy expended by the Minister himself and by others working for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to pursue this matter to an ultimate conclusion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0)

* I would say that the two months from 10 March to 10 May have been two months in which much community attitude has been developed which is supportive of the cause of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.

* The Opposition moved an amendment to clause 3 of the Bill, definitions, in which 'Aboriginal Community' is defined as meaning a community for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> established, or deemed to have been established, under or by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act.

* Senator Collard  's statement on the years of litigation that might result from this Government using the powers it has to acquire this land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sounds to me very much like blackmail.

* During this session, the Parliament has spent a considerable amount of time on discussions about the responsibilities of the Federal Government as they relate to land rights and the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We have adopted something like a common stand in many respects, even though one sometimes is appalled at the degree to which some Government senators seek to impute improper motives and make highly critical extremist statements relating to the attitude of the Australian Labor Party in respect of the plight that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> find themselves in some 220 years since white civilisation came to this continent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It must be said that with the passage of time, during the last decade or so, the question of Aboriginal land rights has become a very important issue in the thinking and the consciousness of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Therefore, one finds it difficult to appreciate the reluctance of those people- more often than not they are found on the conservative side of the politicswho still resist the recognition that the Australian community and the parliaments generally owe to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We hope that the Senate will regard the amendments as genuine attempts to realise the objectives of those people who support the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to land rights, to realise the objectives which the Government set itself in the original legislation and to realise the objectives of the Party that I represent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* To an extent there has been a great deal of shadow sparring and we have not as yet reached the point at which we can say to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that we have fulfilled this important demand that they have made upon the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Opposition is prepared to support this piece of legislation because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is necessary that some of the machinery measures in the amending Bill which the Senate is now discussing should be passed to enable the realisation of the objectives of the Government, the objectives of the Opposition and the objectives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* This will enable- I am sure this is why the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are anxious to see the legislation considered- the early establishment of land trusts to hold title to the land described in Schedule 1 of the principal Act, which includes all of the major Aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I am prepared to pay some tribute to the Government for the alacrity with which it has recognised the deficiency in the original legislation and to commend it for the progress that it has taken on this matter to see that land rights are given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Of course, when one looks at the definitions in other Acts dealing with land rights and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whether it be the Queensland Act or our own Acts, one finds that in the minds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, land represents premises. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Just as whites put a fence around their piece of land and doors and locks on their houses and that is regarded as their property, we have to see that property in the minds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> means the land upon which they have resided and which they have used generation by generation, century by century and era by era. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We saw ourselves as do-gooders, people who could sit in judgment and decide what was good for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We are in a period where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want selfdetermination, self-management and land rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Minister went on to say that a further aspect of the Government's policy in relation to Aboriginal land rights is to allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> 'as owners of their land, to follow their own lifestyles on their own land to me extent that they choose, to participate in and influence the course of development of and on their traditional land, and to take advantage of the full range of opportunities which development may open up to them '. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We in the Opposition fully share the view expressed in that statement but we take issue with  Senator Collard  who talked about assimilation as against the very important distinction that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have and require the right to make the decision of whether they want to be assimilated into a white civilisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It appears that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as owners of their land, will be allowed 'to follow their own lifestyles on their own land to the extent that they choose', only to the extent that they allow their land to be used for such purposes and under such conditions as are set out in this amending legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Bill removes the power of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decline to make an agreement with the Director of National Parks and Wildlife for the use of their land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Whether it wants the land for a park, for mining, for a town or for some other public purpose, when that point is reached white priority takes over from the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to title as expressed in the land rights concept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In fact, the Opposition sees every reason why the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have a priority over the needs of white civilisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not to be given prior dominion over the land and its natural assets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The rights which in the 1976 legislation rested with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may now be given to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and I would feel much asssured if the Minister for once would have discussions with the land council first and with the mining interests last. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is intimidatory and acts in a way that will prevent the free flow of information which is essential if we are to realise the objective of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Firstly we are told that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to be granted land rights over certain areas, but then they must lease them to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Then we are told that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to have full access to information relating to uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region but that they can use the information only in such ways as are laid down in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The secrecy provision prevents the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from disclosing material to the public, I draw to the attention of honourable senators opposite the fact and that this provision was neglected in the otherwise detailed second reading speech of the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The provisions protect the power of corporate secrecy and make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> impotent to challenge a company if it considers that disclosing its technical information might tend to incriminate it in regard to the protection of the environment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In that regard, it is apparent that in certain aspects of the amending legislation the Government is saying that the promotion of the processing, mining and exporting of uranium should take precedence over justice, land rights and the very principles of self-determination for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* When it came to the conflict, the Government put other interests before the attainment of the principles in the field of Aboriginal affairs and before the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I put it to the Government and to the Senate that when there is a conflict over these issues the paramount responsibility is to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is my purpose to argue, therefore, that the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should take precedence over any supposed urgency of promoting a package of uranium Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Labor Party would argue that our primary responsibility rests with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We would argue that the sacrificing of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which could come about as a result of this amending legislation puts their rights at the altar of uranium mining and export. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Notwithstanding those areas of criticism, because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> see the Bill as a step forward in overcoming some of the defects in the earlier legislation, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill but will be moving three amendments at the Committee stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Mr Justice  Fox recommended that the land should go to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> subject to a lease to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* That recommendation is not one which the Government dreamed up as a restriction on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* On page 204 of that report it is pointed out by the Fox inquiry that it regarded the wishes of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for land rights in the area as of prime importance in any consideration of the establishment of a national park. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In fact, it was a recommendation which came from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves that the procedure we are following now should be followed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* This move has been subject to arrangements which have as their genesis the suggestions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The other matter in  Senator Gietzelt  's comments which concerned me was his claim that in some way the Government was fostering a closed government and the restriction under this legislation of access by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to information. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The fact of the matter is that the legislation, together with the other Bills with which we will be dealing shortly, provides very extensive powers to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned, not only in relation to access to information but also in relation to the enforcement of standards which are imposed upon mining companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* In other words, the information to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are given access is for the purpose of enforcing standards; it is not for the purpose of disclosing it to the commercial rivals of the mining companies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* They do not suggest that we should alter that legislation in the way in which we are altering it now but that it should be altered in a way which would substantially diminish the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The fact of the matter has been that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have provided as little fetter to non-Aboriginal activity as have kangaroos. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I welcome the Minister's affirmation that people dealing with areas which are subject to Aboriginal rights now have to accept that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do have rights in these matters and that they have to be accommodated accordingly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Again that is an important statement because it is implicit in that statement that at times <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will make choices which will not suit other people; but they will be choices which they make in their own freedom to make them, to follow their own lifestyles and to live their own lives on their own land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* What we did, however, was to give the Aboriginal people, the owners, extensive rights to the surface which meant that persons seeking the minerals could take them subject to the greater right of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to surface use and to surface enjoyment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is alleged that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being given a special right which is not possessed by any other section of the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Australian Mining Industry Council should bear that in mind when it puts out such pamphlets, distributes them to members of Parliament and makes statements suggesting that there is something peculiar about the rights which are being granted to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I see a very clear parallel between the protection of farmers in Western Australia and the protection which is being given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I do not think that there is sufficient protection for the nation, for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for the miners or for anybody else in these at large arbitral provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I commend the Bill and I await with interest the Committee stage where I think it will be demonstrated that the fear expressed by  Senator Gietzelt  that this Bill reduces the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rather than enhancing and protecting them is in fact groundless. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* I think that we ought to know that the Australian Mining Industry Council has conducted a fairly vicious campaign over a long period of time against the granting of land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, or, for that matter, anywhere else. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The concept of land-ownership of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is different from that held by Europeans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* So I reiterate the point which has been made by  Senator Bonner  already that there is a clear indication that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fully understand the situation regarding land rights, and they are well aware- if I can use that phrase- of what they believe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* This Bill, as I read it, removes that right, lt removes the power of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decline agreement with the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Pacifists or persons who believe that there is a special duty to the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when a work of this kind is contemplated might strongly advocate, at an early stage, the entire prevention of such a project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0)

* Will he also inquire into the statement of  Mr Porter,  the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs, on the latest  Monday Conference  program that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working on reserves were being paid $10 per week less than the award wage under arrangements with the Federal Government to employ such workers under the National Employment and Training scheme? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0)

* I and my colleagues on this side of the chamber today will go into fairly in depth detail to prove why this Government must take a more positive action in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country and why, as a matter of urgency, it must take a more positive attitude in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live at Mornington Island and Aurukun. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  made a statement shortly after the agreement with the Queensland Government saying that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on both settlements had agreed to a trial period of six months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Only somebody who knows nothing at all about Aboriginals would make such a stupid and ridiculous statement as that because as anybody knows- and  Senator Bonner  would know- this is a sign of war so far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* At another point in the discussion the Minister said that more than half of the 70,000 Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland were living in the mainstream of society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* 
 Mr Porter made another untruthful statement when he said that hundreds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in the Torres Strait region own their own homes and that thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland own their own homes.

* The National policy statement of the Liberal and National Country Parties of November 1975 made it clear that they recognised that fundamental to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>' sense of Aboriginality of affinity with one another- was their affinity with the land.

* We will also make land available, either by grant or through the provision of funds, to tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on or near their traditional areas which arc not on reserves and to detribalised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in rural or urban areas.

* I say that that was an important debate because it was the first time that legislation which gave inalienable rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on their traditional land had been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It ought to be said that, although there has been much comment from the present Opposition about this matter, it did not achieve legislation which gave land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during its term of government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* If we are talking about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities at present, we ought to say that despite the fact that much rhetoric may have been heard from the Opposition about Queensland, it did not have the courage or the capacity to use its powers to do anything about rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly land rights, in that State.

* If we are to talk about the intention of some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to seek further action by the Commonwealth Government perhaps we need to look at South Australia where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have indicated to the Commonwealth Government that they are not satisfied with the action by the State Government on land rights and where certain actions have been taken in that respect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* Looking at the position in South Australia we can place on record that Commonwealth and State Ministers, because more than one State was involved, examined the request of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for further land rights at meetings of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council and appointed joint working parties to advise on possible collaboration that can be achieved among State governments and between State governments and the Commonwealth Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It would seem to us that what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are seeking now in the States is legislation that gives them rights similar to what has been achieved for them in the Northern Territory by this Government.

* Under the agreement, if the Commonwealth is not satisfied with the terms of both the local government legislation and the leases it will exercise its constitutional power to acquire land in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but it has been agreed by everybody that there ought to be a testing period to see whether this legislation will work and will achieve for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the degree of self-management which will enable them to determine their own affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* The Commonwealth Government reiterates its promise to the Aboriginal people that if the way this proposal develops and the way in which the legislation operates do not achieve what we believe is consistent with our policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we will take the ultimate step to acquire the land in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* It should be said in a debate on this matter of public importance, namely, that there is a need for a clear declaration of Government policy on the granting to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders inalienable title to their traditional lands, that there has been a clear statement of Government policy which, in the case of our own territories, has already been enacted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We believe that these two communities are ready for self-management and, as I said in this place when we dealt with the legislation, we would consider acquisition of the land if this were the only way in which our own policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could be achieved consistent with our responsibilities under the powers that were given to the Commonwealth by the Australian people at referendum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* That is the position with regard to the policy of the Government on land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to state that policy in any other way overlooks completely not only the policy which has been clearly stated but also the actions which have been taken by the Government since it was elected in 1975. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0)

* We see a repudiation of that policy in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the current struggle which is going on with the transnational mining companies who are trying to get out of the ground the uranium in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0)

* To make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> pay more for their foodstuffs and for their needs than white people pay on any of the islands have to pay is racial discrimination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* It ill behoves the Minister in the other place who presented the report- I appreciate that  Senator Guilfoyle  is only presenting the report in this place on his behalf- to quote only one portion of the second Ranger report and ignore the most important conclusion of all in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* I am sure that there would not be very many honourable senators on the Government side of the chamber- certainly not many honourable senators on my side of the chamber- who would not assert that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be affected by the development of uranium mining, particularly in the Ranger area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* As you know, one of the principal functions of the Panel was to blend the expertise of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, anthropologists and architects to develop housing schemes which would be uniquely suited to the special needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in isolated areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* The Panel is the only organization in Australia which has consistently designed and had constructed successful housing schemes for remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* That is why, initially, we focussed on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in or near an urban environment, on the empirical evidence that they had elected to live and work in close contact with the European dominated market economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* The first prototype designs were completed by November 1976, have since been built, and are now being occupied most successfully by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for whom they were designed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* By developing prototypes where a demonstrable need existed, the Panel could be sure that, when it assessed a prototype, it could evaluate it in terms of the specific requirements for housing and the behavioural modes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* The Panel also expected that, by locating the first prototypes in or near an urban centre, they would come to the attention of many more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> (visitors to the town) than they would if they were located in a remote location. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* In this way, they were likely to excite comment and, in doing this, yield insights into what other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> thought about them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* As you know, the Department of Construction charges professional fees to Aboriginal associations and I can only assume that the difference between the fees the Panel could charge and its annual budget, if the work has been performed by the Department of Construction, would be lost to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* There seems no conceivable reason why <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would, having rejected similar huts in the 1960s, accept them in 1978. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* I do, however, emphasize that this is an Aboriginal body which, in terms of priorities, acts for the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* In terms of your professed policy of Aboriginal self-management, your decision to cease funding the only Aboriginal organization undertaking a research and development role in housing remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia appears to be a denial of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decide their own priorities and the ways they want to give expression to them and, thus, practice self-management. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* He had been to Warrabri this month, and was told by the manager that he was told by Welfare representatives that as signatory for the co-op he had power to sign it over to Welfare as a social club, and if he did so the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would take a long time to find out, and in any case would not understand the legal processes, also they would guarantee him twice the wages he was receiving currently. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* We believe that this plan is quite different from those first proposed by Stawell for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and that this plan appeared only after  Mr McNeil  had been asked by  Mr Cook  for a plan of the Aputula house and had later found his plan in  Mr Cook's  office with a Stawell Timber Industries stamp on it.

* From our economic analysis of the costs of work in the Northern Territory carried out by the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, we believe that a total house suitable for a family could be built for approximately $ 1 0,000.00 including the connection to services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0)

* I have no doubt that what is happening at Kormilda and Yirara is that we are providing a flow to these settlements and outstations of people who will be vitally influential to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-24-0)

* I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he is aware of an article which appeared in the  Canberra Times  of 18 November 1978 under the headline 'Ignoring the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>' and which, in part, stated: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0)

* There appears to be some doubt about whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> exist, or ever have existed, in Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0)

* I further ask: Will the Minister be kind enough to inform the Western Australian Government that learned anthropologists have proven conclusively that we, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, have been in Australia for 50,000 years at least and that, considering that Western Australia is part of Australia, it is logical to assume that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> existed in that State for 50,000 years? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0)

* Our conclusion in respect of that particular power is that it is such as to fully enable the Commonwealth to act in any conceivable way that it might wish to in conferring self-management rights on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Tones Strait Islanders in Queensland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0)

* Fourthly, what we do in the report is to list a series of alternative courses of legislative action in which the Commonwealth could constitutionally engage so as to secure effective self-management rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland.

* It is extraordinary how, before the agreement with the Aboriginal people was signed, we heard comments about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having too many rights, about apartheid in reversal and about the interests of the white people of Australia being sacrificed in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.

* For the information of honourable senators and in accordance with an undertaking given by the Minister for Trade and Resources in the House of Representatives on 2 1 August 1 979, 1 present a report by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies on the social impact of uranium mining on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-73)

* What seems to flow from this particular report is a confirmation of the concern that has been expressed by the Opposition during the whole period of negotiations with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* Ever since the commencement of land rights and the acquisiton of land in the Territory for the purpose of mining, the Opposition has warned the Government on many occasions- as have many other groups in the Australian communityabout social impact and the destruction of the social life of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a result of this mammoth investment by mining groups in our country, and in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* It has certainly borne out the concern which has been expressed from time to time about the impact that this situation will have on the life and the environment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* It seems to me that the statement, following the report from the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, is an admission that in fact there has not been sufficient surveillance, understanding, or administration of the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been affected by mining activities in the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* We have said and Government reports have shown- as this report now confirms- that interference with the normal life style and life pattern of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area is a matter which has not been properly understood by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* That was the time when  Mr Viner  was hell bent, as I would put it, on stampeding the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area to agree to the Government's proposals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* There was abundant evidence in subsequent debates in the Parliament, particularly in the Senate, when we were able to show that  Mr Viner  was in fact forcing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to accept Government proposals and forcing them, because of his own persuasive powers, ability, capacity and public position, to accept standards which they did not understand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* We said then that if the Government had a proper understanding of the difficulties that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had in comprehending what the Government was about, that if it had some compassion about what effect this move would have on the life style of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that if it had some understanding that it was attempting to impose a white form of administration, or a European type of administration on the Territory, then it would understand that this matter needed to go through the process of a time scale or a discussion, which should be done in an atmosphere of complete understanding so that each and every Aborigine understood what was involved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* We also emphasised this matter when we talked about the Government's haste and in particular  Mr Viner's  haste and the haste of the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony),  in imposing the will of this Government on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in an atmosphere which made it impossible for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to comprehend the effects of those negotiations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* The advice that we preferred to the Government at that time was that the Government should take extraordinary steps to provide the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the concepts of what that would do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* I commend the Minister for tabling the report of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, because I think the debates in this Parliament over the last three or four years have at least drawn to the attention of some members of the Government the need to act more vigilantly, to consider their responsibilities afresh, and to re-examine what has happened with a view to taking the sorts of steps in the future that would elevate the protection of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to a major principle. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* However, the most incredible part of the summary made by the Minister of the report is that now there is recognition that we have to take extraordinary steps to protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but not in any paternalistic way by saying that they do not understand and therefore we need to act on their behalf. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77)

* The issue is providing them with the information, structures and means by which the decisions that are to be made are of such character that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can make a value judgment based on all the facts and not just the financial remuneration that flows from their changed status as land holders.

* But the fact of the matter is that the actual overall expenditure by the Government on legal aid- this does not include legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it is only legal aid provided through the AttorneyGeneral 's Department- has been as follows: In 1976-77, under the first Budget of the present Government, $18,125,000; in 1977-78, $20,177,000; and in 1978-79, $21,989,000.
