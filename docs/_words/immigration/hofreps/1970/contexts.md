* It is because of our efficient <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and the thoroughness with which we have attempted to assimilate these people that the great majority of them have become very good Australians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* There have been accusations, as I have said before, that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy perhaps has aggravated unduly the trend towards inflation and rising costs, but we must balance that against what we have gained.

* I compliment the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  and his Department because I believe they possess the same sort of principles and believe in a questioning of the proper role of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* The Minister has initiated major examinations of aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* The staff of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been most helpful and understanding in any cases I have put before it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Although the Minister has assured the House that the numbers refused naturalisation for political reasons were small, I am very concerned with the development of this view among migrants under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> plan, particularly amongst such a very responsible group. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* It is important that Australians understand what can and what cannot reasonably be asked of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>'s essential role in these areas is to supplement and reinforce other lines of action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I do however believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is being let down in other areas of Commonwealth Government administration, or perhaps the Minister fails to convince his colleagues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* If <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not intended as an alternative to adequate industrial and occupational training facilities, if it does not absolve us from our responsibility to train professional, skilled and other key workers, then the complete lack of forward long term Australian objectives in education and quality of education, which was highlighted in the recent debate on the estimates for the Department of Education and Science, should not exist. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers overseas, particularly in countries sending large numbers to Australia, can and do start this process from the time the first approaches are made, wherever practicable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Perhaps after 25 years the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should not only be concerned with just mere money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* For these and other reasons we have had a sustained <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme since the end of the Second World War. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I believe that this aspect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy was a valid one, and still is, though perhaps to a lesser extent today when military technology has, to a certain degree at least, overcome the advantages previously enjoyed by sheer numbers of people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* However, it is in the increase of our economic strength that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has had its most easily measurable impact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* In addition, cultural benefits have also been derived from our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* That there are problems and costs associated with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme nobody denies, and I would like to look at some of the criticisms that have been raised, lt has been said that not enough use has been made of many skilled personnel who emigrate to Australia and I believe that in some cases this is and has been the case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I mention the convertibility of qualifications and I believe it is to the credit of the Department of Labour and National Service that it has undertaken the task of compiling a guide to European technical qualifications and their approximate equivalent here, lt is also a tribute to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that in 1969 it established a committee on overseas professional qualifications. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* There are some other aspects of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which have disturbed me in the past but I believe that steps which have recently been taken will do much to overcome criticism. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I firmly believe our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should be based on the needs of this country, the availability of suitable migrants and the capacity of the Australian community to integrate migrants into our society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I believe the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is aware of these problems and by the provision of migrant educational services, social workers, welfare officers, trained contact workers, together with a host of voluntary workers, it does much to reduce the problems of migrants in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Research into desirable future population levels together with the structure and distribution of the population within Australia can only be of great assistance in assessing desirable levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* A cost-benefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and time span surveys of migrants during their early years will provide much needed back-up data and disclose avenues for further initiative in the selection and integration of settlers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* The appointment of authorities on urbanisation and environment to the Migration Planning Council can only add to the effectiveness of this Council and, together with the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Publicity Council, it will act as a source of good advice to this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* The approach adopted by the Minister and his Department, particularly the efforts quantitatively and qualitatively to assess the selection procedures, desirable intake levels, assimilation procedures, and contribution of new settlers will do much to answer the questions of those who view our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy with some suspicion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* This important fact is in no small way a tribute to my colleague, the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  who was Australia's first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Throughout the years since its commencement our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has had the support of both sides of this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I am sure that all honourable members look forward to a continuation of this general agreement in future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* May I point out that probably the first occasion on which this Government implemented our policy was in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Our policy has been quoted this evening during this debate by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has been administered in the past in a way that has met with the approval of all political parties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* My colleague, the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen),  questioned the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on the effectiveness of the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Unfortunately, even though it was very early in the day, during question time, the Prime Minister missed the point of the question and answered that he did not realise that any members of Parliament thought that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy was bad. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* It is to the credit of the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  that he has recently ordered a searching inquiry of Australia's future migration needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I would like to support the proposition put so capably this evening by the honourable member for Grayndler on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that the most suitable type of inquiry to investigate the future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs of our nation is, without a doubt, a joint committee of both Houses of this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* At this Convention I heard a number of very interesting matters associated with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> discussed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* In other parts of the world we find, for example, that after the formation of Israel in 1948 the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake reached 239,000 per annum in 1949 on a base population of only 800,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* However, attention has already been drawn to the fact that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in Australia appears to be at the crossroads. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* If I may say so without undue congratulation, I think our Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  is characteristically attuned to the tempo of the times in that he has inaugurated or is inaugurating a fairly wide ranging series of investigations to which the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  amongst others, previously drew attention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* This seems to be, from all reports, something which the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is pursuing consistently. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* Finally, because I have to allow other members to make a short speech in this debate, I suggest that the problem of the crossroads position of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme as it is seen by some is near enough to being real. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26)

* I must say that the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  set the tone of the debate in opening the discussion on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28)

* The assignment will be conducted under the general supervision of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council which includes Professor B. R.

* For reasons that were explained by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  and explained in technical detail also in the 48th report of the Commissioner of Taxation, 9 Bills have to be presented on a sales tax measure because of the way in which the tax is imposed.

* What has not been told to this House by the Treasurer or by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  who is Minister assisting the Treasurer is, which are the sorts of companies that are likely to be advantaged by this new device or by the opening of the gate to the convertible note once more. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0)

* Has the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to an article in the 'Australian' on Tuesday, 13 th October, written by  Mr Peter  Ryan, in which he claims that  Mr J.  R. Wilson, who has been appointed by the Minister to head the inquiry into the costs and benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, has prejudged the inquiry already by stating that he is in favour of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-6-0)

* Essentially, it is a challenge to the professional integrity of  Mr J.  R. Wilson, a senior lecturer at the Sydney University, who has been appointed to undertake the cost benefit analysis which was announced some months ago and, by inference also, it is a challenge to the integrity and the judgment of the distinguished academics, bankers, industrialists and trade union officials who constitute the membership of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council which recommended the study and agreed to  Mr Wilson's  appointment.

* Is he aware also that successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have consistently, and quite rightly in my view, justified and supported the policy on moral, social and economic grounds evidently because of their belief that a government has a moral obligation to protect its own people particularly from racial tensions and friction?

* Successive <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Conventions and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council have confirmed that the great barrier to assimilation and integration is the failure of the migrant to speak English and expressed the view that there is a real need for the teaching of the English language at every level for assimilation, social and economic reasons.

* Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into migrants the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated - 1 think the word is now integrated - into the community.

* I might say on this general question of the departure of migrants from Australia that the figures for 1970-71 recently published by the Commonwealth Statistician which show that about 28,000 migrants left Australia or stated that they were leaving Australia permanently, have to be seen against the very high level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that we have had in the last 3 years.

* It is time that the people realised that the Australian Labor Party stands for the abolition of censorship, the recognition of Scientology, the breakdown of the standard of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, the importation of unemployment, because of the stated views of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to tariffs and the revaluation of the Australian dollar and because the Labor Party is pushing for shorter working hours without any regard for increased productivity.

* Whereas the Leader of the Opposition has been most guarded and vague concerning Labor's policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, it must be remembered that he replaced his shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is at present sitting at the table on the Opposition side, when he was expounding policies similar to the policy of the Government and that the Labor Premier of South Australia has made a call virtually to open the flood gates to non-European migration.

* The activities of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction - and let me say that the hidden remnants of that postwar reconstruction have been hidden in the archives of the Minister for Trade and Industry's Department over these long years - and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> saw Australia's early post-war development off to a good start.

* The House will well recollect that the inquiry sponsored by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> into the reasons why such a growing higher proportion of migrants are returning home established the major reason as being that social security and social welfare services - covering the broad conspectus of these things - in Australia are so inferior to what are available overseas.

* I believe that should a Labor government in Western Australia or a possible future Labor Federal government announce its intention to withdraw from the specific approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that has proved so successful over the years and to confine it purely to the whims of people already in Australia - that policy has been enunciated and was made even clearer recently by the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland - it will be disastrous for Australia.

* The problem is so serious that, quite apart from the Government's views on the Labor Party's scheme, our thoughts on general practitioners and the suggestion that general practice clinics might help to reestablish the standing of the general practitioner is in accord with the views expressed - and I trust that the Minister can find time to read them when he has finished speaking to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  at the table- by the Australian Medical Association study group on general practice in its pamphlet entitled General Practice and Its Future in Australia'.

* Of course, this is not a Commonwealth responsibility but, since <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a Commonwealth responsibility, it is not too much to expect that the Commonwealth should make very firm representations to the States that the rigid educational facilities and staffing establishments in the schools affected should be made more flexible so that the job can be carried out properly.

* In addition to the points that have been raised tonight on whether migrants should be allowed into this country, 1 think to some extent we must realise that some of the opposition to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has developed because of the popularisation of what is commonly known as zero population growth.

* I repeat that remark and say that it is to the credit of the Australian Labor Party that it has cast itself adrift from the discriminatory practices into which this Government has allowed itself to lapse in the interpretation of what we hoped could have continued to be an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that did not discriminate against people for malicious reasons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* I want to refer to several aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that I believe give the lie to some of the instant policies of the Government of recent times and which indicate very clearly the breakdown of what we hoped could have continued as a fair and reasonable bipartisan policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>.

* Firstly, the Government would lose effective control of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and in particular it would lose control over the composition of the programme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* Secondly, the Government would be precluded from using the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* I want particularly to comment on the loss of effective Government control over <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which would result from Labor policies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* Effective control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requires firstly, that the composition of the migrant intake in terms of sources, skills and integration prospects is suitably balanced, and secondly, that action should be taken by the Government as and when necessary to ensure that the numbers and types of migrants coming to Australia are in harmony with our needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* In these important respects Labor's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies would provide insufficient control. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* The second of the major defects in Labor's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies is that the government would be precluded from using the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* With only sponsored migration the government would also be prevented from using the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme as an effective instrument of population policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* In this context it is relevant to remind the Parliament that the Government has commissioned far-reaching population studies which are premised on the availabality to the Government of effective control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a means of implementing population policies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* In summary, regardless pf whether sponsorship is confined to relatives or is more widely based the Labor Party's policies would mean that firstly the Government would lose effective control of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* Thirdly, if sponsorship were to be confined to relatives <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would fall drastically - so much so that we would face the very real prospect of being unable to make good our own population losses through emigration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* Fourthly, if broader based sponsorships were adopted the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would still fall sharply to begin with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24)

* Moreover, having voluntarily relinquished effective control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, a government which implemented Labor's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies would be largely powerless to redress the situation.

* If the case for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is for Australia's benefit alone then as an advanced, rich country we surely stand condemned for taking only those who are well qualified to fit easily into this country.

* On the one hand, the Government alleges a desire to remove discrimination in various pieces of legislation, particularly the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program; on the other hand, it continues legislation, particularly in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> area, which in fact perpetuates a number of those provisions which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  could well have removed if he was prepared to take upon himself the burden of undoing any sense of preferment "which is currently enjoyed by British citizens.

* The point of misrepresentation, of course, was that at no time in relation to the correspondence with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did I place any embargo on my capacity to make this matter public, particularly in the circumstances in which the fact of this publication came about as a direct consequence of a copy of a letter which was sent to me.

* That letter, dated 28 August, I believe makes some quite serious allegations which the Minister has not answered and which I believe he should answer because the Opposition has been pressing for a statement from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on Australia's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> progam and it has not been forthcoming.

* The Government considered that with the changing pattern of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Australia and the Government's own initiatives in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy giving priority to family reunion and sponsored' migration it should attain self-sufficiency in respect of movement of migrants and that it was no longer appropriate for Australia to remain a member of ICEM.

* My main reason in rising to participate in this Committee debate is to express my concern at the deliberate attempts by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who is sitting at the table, to downgrade the responsibilities of this Parliament.

* Unfortunately in the second reading speech on this Bill the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who represents in this House the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt),  did not realise that the Prime Minister had had such a Press conference.

* In the debate on the Budget, the kicking of the rural community at the hands of the Labor Party and by the honourable member for Riverina, the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who has completely welshed on those who elected him to this place, was stressed by member after member on this side of the House.

* The deplorable exercise of irresponsibility demon strated in this place a few seconds ago by a man who is currently the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, a man who has failed in his responsibilities to his electors demonstrably through the Bill that is before us, through the Budget and the neglect of rural interests which that Budget represented, is one of the damnations that must apply to this Government.

* I wonder how the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - I am told that he is a current financial member of the Australian Journalists Association, a journalist of some sort presumably in the past - regards this exercise of irresponsibility on the part of one of his ministerial colleagues and how he regards this treatment of the Press, the giving to them of a statement which has not corresponded with the truth of the assertions of the Budget.

* If the Government's left hand - particularly the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, representing the Minister for Primary Industry in this House, belatedly it is true; and I really wonder whether he is not ashamed to do so, but then again perhaps he does not represent his electorate - catches up with what the right hand, the Prime Minister, is doing or saying, perhaps then the Parliament can be told.

* In his speech, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - a man who once had pretentions to be Minister for Primary Industry until he became apprehensive of where his policies or the policies of his colleague might lead him - made the point that he did not think the levy would be passed on to producers, with profit margins of 0.7c and l.'25c per lb and a levy, according to the Bill, of 1.6c per lb.

* There are two possibilities: One is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Riverina, misled the House when he introduced the legislation, because the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said something which contradicts what the Minister said.

* With great respect,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I think' that this is highly relevant to the Bill because we are told by this Government in the Budget Speech and by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that one thing is going to happen and then the Prime Minister in the same hour is saying something quite different to the Press and that is completely, categorically and irrefutably proved.

* We should demand that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> give a categorical guarantee that there will not be amending legislation within a week to increase this tax, as some Government supporters want, to a punitive level of 12c per lb which is basically, as I understand it, the kind of tax recommended by Government members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices - a tax that would bring in something like $160m to $170m a year additional revenue to the Government and which, at the same time, they would hope would force down the price of meat and keep it off the export market.

* When this debate began I had considerable sympathy for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  because he would not be the first Minister who, acting for another Minister, has picked up a Bill with whose contents he was not fully au fait.

* The folk concerned have written to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but have received no reply. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* Following this, I made further representations to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 15 February pointing out that I had received a further representation and stating that I would appreciate the Minister looking into the matter as it was now a matter of some urgency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* On 22 February I received in a reply a telegram from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* From 22 October when my first letter was sent to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and I first made representations in this regard - I say nothing about the original letter written by this lady in September because, as I said earlier, it was written to my State colleague who forwarded it on to me in October - to this day, no final decision has been made on this matter and I believe that nobody would dispute my statement when I said that there was something wrong with the administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* A great deal has been spoken about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and about all the various factors relating to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, yet here is a case which I think is - I use the word sincerely - a disgrace to the 'Department, that over a period of time the Department cannot give a reply to a member making representations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* Yet on exactly the same day I received a telegram from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> informing me that the person concerned had been interviewed in the country where the application originally had been made and that it was hoped that very soon that person would be given permission to enter Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* So, frankly, I think that this case, plus the other cases to which I have referred show a need for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to pay a little more attention to what is happening in Sydney than travelling around overseas telling everybody what a marvellous Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Government we have and what can be done. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* I informed the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that I intended to raise this matter this evening because I think that the length of time it has taken is beyond all bounds of reasonableness. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* I have always taken the view that when an application is made to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> confidentiality should prevail between the applicant and the Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0)

* The availability of tradesmen under the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is a diminishing factor. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-15-0)

* In fact, we have seen a discontinuance, largely, of the past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs which have provided many of the skilled workers who contribute in this area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0)

* Australia has nothing to apologise for in its current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* by leave - I take this opportunity to make comment not only about the particular matter that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has mentioned but also about other aspects of his <span class="highlight">immigration</span> administration for the simple reason that the Minister has resolutely, over a long period, not encouraged, not enabled and not taken any measures in this House to permit a proper debate of the alleged <span class="highlight">immigration</span> changes he has made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* But there is another area in which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in particular are culpable in relation to Australia's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in a way in which no similar charge can be laid against any other Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or any other Prime Minister since the days of Arthur Calwell, the first and possibly the greatest Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whom Australia has had. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* It is a pity that his tradition in helping to establish a bi-partisan approach to this matter could not have been continued because it was Arthur Calwell - it was probably only a member of the Labor Party who could do it - who gained trade union support for a large and continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* Now, partly from grandstanding and partly from belief and a search for publicity that general trade union support for a continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program looks like being threatened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* It is being threatened because the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are more concerned with publicity and are more concerned with immediate happenings than with the long term and solid development of Australia on a basis that does not arouse concern and passion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will presumably be dashing those expectations in the same way as he has in relation to the Fijians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* The important point in this proposal is that it runs the risk, as has become most evident in the last few days, of jeopardising continuing trade union support for a substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that Australia needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* It is a situation that would seriously jeopardise the continuing support of the trade unions for an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* Again, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and particularly the Prime Minister are culpable for having established the circumstances in which aspirations which will not be fulfilled have been aroused in the Philippines and in which fears have been aroused in the trade union movement for the first time since Arthur Calwell, to his continuing and lasting credit, sold an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to the trade union movement of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* In relation to Fiji, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has ignored the experience and the advice of officers of his Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* By making that statement he aroused expectations that cannot and will not be fulfilled even by the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is concerned with headlines and not with the substance of policy in relation to these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* He is interested in the froth and not the responsibility of administering <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* An example perhaps of the understandable but overdeveloped wish for publicity of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> can be seen from a news release issued by the Minister - I understand it was written by him - when he described the welcome given to him in Calabria. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* He would do much better to look to his responsibilities to the Australian Parliament and people and to the administration of his Department rather than perpetually to seek flamboyance and headlines which will damage the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* What this Parliament needs - I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to produce it - is a clear statement of the Government's policy and of the changes of emphasis that have been introduced and of the new policy initiatives which he alleges he has introduced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* I indicate the importance of this matter because many of the policy initiatives which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> claims to have introduced in relation to the welfare of migrants in Australia were policy initiatives formerly announced by my colleagues the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  or the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* I hope that the contempt with which he treats the Parliament in relation to major statements of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, of which there is none that I can recall in this Parliament, and the contempt which he has so far shown for the Notice Paper by failing to answer questions, will not be continued. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* I ask him to make a statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and to allow it to be properly debated - not by one or two speakers a side but properly debated - in this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* I am sure that the powers of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are great enough for him to persuade the Leader of the House that this matter is worthy of debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been going around saying one thing today and another thing tomorrow. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* I believe that the statement which has been made today by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> certainly will not help our relations with those countries, particularly with Fiji. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* I agree with the honourable member for Wannon that there is an urgent need for re-examination of the total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the present Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  has said that there will be full opportunity for any member of this Parliament, especially myself and the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock),  to speak about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  Her  Majesty the Queen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

 Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>) -  Mr Speaker,  I seek leave to make a personal explanation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* The honourable member for Wannon - a former Minister - suggested and stated during the course of his remarks that I had made no statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this Parliament.

* When he sought to make a statement in this House on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on a previous occasion leave was denied to him to do so and he had no alternative but to present a paper without comment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* Pages 1979 and onwards of Hansard of October last year indicate that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> sought leave to make a short statement, but to have incorporated in Hansard - a quite unusual procedure - the body of his statement.

* I think I have made the point that I wanted to, and that is that the Leader of the House and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had indicated that there was an opportunity for a debate in the last session of Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21)

* The present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is, of course, responsible for Government policy but I believe that the previous Minister,  Mr Grassby,  must be condemned for allowing trained political activists to come into this country with no real intention to abide by this nation's principles or aspirations.

* I can only assume from discussion between many people and officers of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that that is not the Minister's intention because there are a large number of ports around the Australian coastBell Bay would continue to be one as are Whyalla, Gove, Weipa, Groote Eylandt, Ardrossan, and Port Lincoln, to name a few- where the company concerned generally uses its own facilities and its own labour to load or unload ships when there is not a register of waterside worker labour.

* In October the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in a Press statement that he could not responsibly approve the entry of migrants who were likely to experience difficulty in finding and holding employment and who would be competing with Australians and migrants already here in the tight sections of the labour market.

* When the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  brings amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act into this Parliament they deserve better consideration and more sympathetic consideration than the Opposition has been prepared to give them, particularly in light of the experience gained by practitioners and others who particpate in the conciliation and arbitration procedure.

* The only reaction I got on that day on which I spoke when I pointed out the position of these people- I spoke of how misunderstood they are, the extent of their handicap, how people showed them no patience, no understanding, because of their deafness- was for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to sit on the front bench aping deafness and actually performing a comic opera which disgusted me.

* Be that as it may, one of the major problems we must face with this question is the danger that the trade unions will become too centralised in the sense that if all courses are to be run through this Authority, there is a very real danger, of which no doubt the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is aware, that if certain ideological sections of the community set out to gain control of this Authority, and in particular control of its syllabus, the implications for the settlement of industrial disputes in Australia is very serious indeed.

* One must comment, therefore, in this debate on the initiative which was undertaken by the FraserAnthony Government soon after December of last year to decrease interest rates by 1 per cent This decision, taken with the whole package announced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, gives positive proof that we are concerned about the housing needs of the Australian people and that we totally oppose the philosophy of the Labor administration which said that the Australian people would have to get used to the idea of living in smaller homes.

* I trust that the ensuing debate at least will lead to consideration of vital questions of policy in the future and will lead, to some degree, to solutions to the problems which we will have to face in the short term and the long term in relation to population policy, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and community affairs.

* If we did accept the assumption of the Minister- I suggest at this point that the assumption is still very questionable indeed- that fertility rates are declining and will continue inevitably to decline and that the major way in which the Government can affect the composition of Australia's population is through regulating the level and composition of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, a whole series of other factors needs to be taken into account. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0)

* Firstly, the rationale that the Minister presents in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is one largely of turning the tap on when we need them and turning the tap off when the economic circumstances do not permit their ready integration into the workforce. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0)

* Since <span class="highlight">immigration</span> levels are determined largely by government decision, predictions must be based on political forethought. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0)

* Australia's capability of managing various levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in relation to overall population size to date has largely been determined by political economy factors, particularly the capacity of many industrialists to seek cheaper labour and bigger markets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0)

* Indeed, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, on page 9 of his statement stated: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0)

* Yes, it may be true that there was a national consensus in 1945 upon <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for those purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0)

* For instance, one of the major characteristics of Australia in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is its highly industrialised nature and the roles that immigrants are expected to play within the work force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0)

* When traditional British and Western European sources of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have declined Australia has had to recruit migrants from countries or areas within countries- for example, rural Greece and Yugoslavia- without the background, education and industrialisation necessary to produce well-trained manpower.

* I wish to direct the attention of the House, as I have directed, by way of a letter, the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  to one of the problems for migrants in the Geelong area which has resulted from the amalgamation of the former Department of Labor and the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the separation of those departments since the change of Government last year.

* We have been through periods of rapid expansion in our industrial and manufacturing capacity, of rapid population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> growth, of stock market booms, of unprecedented minerals and resource discoveries and of significant recognition by the world community and, in particular, by many of our Asian neighbours.

* The Committee of Economic Inquiry chaired by  Dr J.

* I point out to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and to the House that if a comparison were made between that report and the reports and the studies that have been made in Canada, United States, the United Kingdom and other parts of the world it would be found to be in fact an extremely poor report.

* The crucial question for policy making is whether we accept that target figure and adjust our policies to it or whether we accept 16 million people as a base which can be increased quite substantially by a deliberate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of allowing in up to 20 million or even more new migrants.

* It is incredible when one considers that with a population of 13.9 million in one of the richest countries in the world, that this is the very first time that there has been a Green Paper on this matter placed before this Parliament for the Parliament as a whole to debate, giving it an opportunity to consider Australia's future population growth and in particular <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies.

* As the Minister said when he introduced the Green Paper into the Parliament, the previous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which has operated in this country for nearly 30 years was responsible for bringing to Australia over 3.3 million new settlers who, together with their children born in Australia subsequent to their arrival, have been responsible for about half of Australia's postwar growth from 7.4 million to 13.9 million people.

* Like the Minister I draw to the attention of the House that unless we have a proper <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy not only will we have reached the situation of zero population growth but we will find that this country in the 1980s- that is barely 3 to 4 years off- will have a very severe manpower shortage.

* After Labor initiated this program- and a former colleague of mine, the previous member for Parkes,  Mr Leslie  Haylen went round the world in a difficult situation gathering up the ships to bring these people to Australia- we found that a unity ticket evolved on the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>.

* I believe that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, in cooperation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  should be giving much deeper thought to the need to lift from 14 per cent the intake of Asian migrants and should have regard to the need to bring people from Oceania.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0)

* We must stimulate proper <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, namely, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that is compatible with our economic requirements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0)

* In the short time remaining I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who has produced a totally new approach to the problem.

* So when one comes to weigh up the advantages to Australia one should not be too glib about assuming that all the advances, or an enormous proportion of the advances in our standard of well-being, have been due to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>.

* One of the arguments put forward in this whole <span class="highlight">immigration</span> argument is that we need the migrants because that is the only way to get young people to help to support the old people.

* I have no doubt whatever that when this situation is arrested the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is doing an excellent job, and the Government will ensure that increased migration takes place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Secondly, the estimated net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rate in the current financial year is little more than 30 000 people, compared with only 21 000 people in 1975-76. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* It all adds up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with little or no natural increase in population and only a very small net gain from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in previous statements in this House has made it clear that there is a numerical decline in what has historically been the mainstay of the labour force, the male worker; and the risk that we shall become increasingly inward looking and a stagnant society.

* The reference to factory fodder is used by anti-<span class="highlight">immigration</span> people and is supposed to end all discussion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Of course, the Broken Hill Company, General MotorsHolden's, the Ford Motor Company and others supported <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the basis of obtaining unskilled labour as well as consumers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* I would also like to criticise more specifically some of the opponents of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* They are basically the same people who opposed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ever since it became fashionable to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* I suppose that ever since large scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span> started its opponents have argued that in periods of full employment the cost of basic services required for migrants- the so-called build-up of a social infrastructure- was so great as to use up our very limited resources. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Such people in most cases are still opponents of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and now argue the opposite, namely, that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will cause unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Before discussing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, I would first like to address myself to the findings of the first report of the National Population Inquiry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Population Inquiry highlights some quite startling facts which I believe must provide the basis for future government planning, not only in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but in almost all areas of government policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* If this is the case, one should think very carefully before accepting the necessity for high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Of course, this has strong implications for future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* As a result and in the absence of any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program a continued decline in fertility rates in my opinion will lead us not only to zero population growth but even further to negative rates of population growth in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* In these circumstances, Australia's governments in future will have to look increasingly to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs to maintain reasonable rates of population growth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* I agree wholeheartedly with the comment by the honourable member for Lilley that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be seen as a very valuable addition to the Australian population but not as a substitute for it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Given that any initiatives to redress that imbalance would take a long while to implement, quite clearly there will be a case for a much higher <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake in the years to come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Therefore, in view of the predicted decline in the rate of natural growth to Australia's population, on balance I support the view that higher <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates are required for the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* First, we need to consider such an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in terms of Australia's economic structure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* If the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake is undertaken together with some restructuring of domestic industries in order to allow the laws of comparative advantage to take effect, such a program is well justified and is in the best interests of both Australia and our trading partners in the region. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* The second qualification I have relates to the rate of increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> levels should be sufficiently flexible to take account of Australia's short term domestic economic problems, our manpower needs and our changing capacity to absorb immigrants after giving full examination to the social consequences of large, constant intakes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* But having made those qualifications, on balance and for the reasons I have already stated, I would support the need for a substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for Australia for the foreseeable future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* One of the main functions of Australia 's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in the past has been to increase the labour force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Also, in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, coupled with declining fertility rates, Australia will become an ageing nation and it is suggested that within, say, one generation the total proportion of the population dependent on those of working age will increase. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the need for Australia to increase its rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> over the longer term primarily because we had a humanitarian obligation to the poorer nations to develop our richly endowed country for their benefit and also for our longer term benefit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Notwithstanding the arguments I have advanced for increasing our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program over the longer term, I submit that this Government and all future Australian Governments have an obligation to ensure that we amend the present social and economic structure of Australia so that those women who wish to raise a family are no longer penalised or discriminated against as compared with the typical 2-income families. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* In concluding my remarks I congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for the way in which he has handled his portfolio in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia's population should remind us all that we should be taking more notice of population trends. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* The preface of this Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia's population indicates that the size, composition and distribution of our population will have a major influence on the nature of our future society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* If we close our minds and eyes to the problems of the pressing necessity of a large part of the undeveloped world- much of it a starving world- we will no doubt shelve our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problem with probably the excuse that because we have a high percentage of unemployed we cannot allow more migrants to enter the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* That is at the present rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* I do not say that that is the only consideration that should be taken into account when we are looking at altering our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* It seems to me that speakers from both sides of the House do not appear to be advocating an all-out <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* We should make it known that we reject the proposition that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can be used to solve economic difficulties or that it should provide an underpinning of unskilled labour to be hired or fired at the whim of an industry, whether in a time of full employment or in a time of high unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* In accordance with these principles, a moderate level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be proposed with special consideration given to parents and dependants of former settlers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should always be balanced with these considerations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is the second major component of population growth and it is here that the rate of growth should be regulated to allow the maximum welfare of the present community and those who make their homes here. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Other speakers have claimed that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cannot be turned on and off but it seems to me that the facts of life would indicate that we cannot leave the gates wide open irrespective of how much we would like to admit people from the developing countries.

* The debate and much of the discussion is looking ahead not to next year, not even to the next decade, but to the next century because the policies that we implement with regard to Australia's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and, putting it in a wider context, with regard to Australia's population, will determine the manner of the future development of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* So when we read in the Green Paper that a series of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> options have been put forward, I think that we should rephrase the term '<span class="highlight">immigration</span> options' and refer to 'population options '. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* A point I want to make at this stage is that over the past few years we have looked at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs upon the basis of the number of new settler arrivals and we have said that there will be 100 000 new settlers coming to Australia in a particular year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Net migration, rather than gross settler arrivals, is used in measuring population growth due to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, as it takes account of departures from Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* Yet there is a certain illogical position for those vehement critics of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> who see the stimulatory effects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> during inflation but fail to admit the potential for recovery from recession in the same source.

* I believe that consideration should be given to changing the title to Minister for Population, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to draw attention to the significance of migration in terms of Australia's total population program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* But at the moment I am not inclined to come down on the side of those people who say that we ought to reduce <span class="highlight">immigration</span> simply on the grounds that it increases competition for jobs, though probably not on very good logical grounds. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0)

* In entering a debate on Australia's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and population it strikes me as rather odd that the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  who preceded me in this debate, spent all his time talking about Aborigines.

* But I do think that the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  during his time both as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the first Whitlam Government and now as Commissioner for Community Relations, has devoted a good deal of time and attention to a lot of the problems which are canvassed in this Green Paper that we are discussing tonight.

* Whilst people have commented from time to time on the way in which certain programs have administered by the Government and on certain directions that the Government is now seeking to take, basically we have been talking in largely theoretical terms about directions of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies.

* On the other hand this Government reintroduced the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and expanded it to include ethnic affairs, a recognition of the fact that the Government does not see migrants as being just workers but rather as people with a unique and cultural heritage which we should encourage them to foster as they become Australian citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I would like to say a few words about the Government's recently announced intention to increase Australia 's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Firstly, I state that under the Labor Government in 1975-76 Australia's <span class="highlight">immigration</span> reached the lowest level since 1947 when there was an intake of 52,000 people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* This Government, on the other hand, has decided to increase the net annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake to 70,000 for the first year of the triennial rolling program which commenced in the year 1 978-79. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* On balance, in my opinion, this expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program should be welcomed by all Australians; but it must be done sensibly, with caution and with a certain degree of flexibility. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* It is difficult in times of high unemployment to gain widespread acceptance of the need for an expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span> poliCy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Also, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can provide a labour force mobility which might not otherwise exist. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* In addition, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can meet occupational shortages and help to overcome lags in domestic retraining schemes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Also, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can help to provide a balance to the work force component of the population which would grow only at diminishing rates with the present and projected combination of a declining natural population growth rate and an aging of that population. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> also can improve expectations of the business community regarding future markets, thereby influencing its output and investment decisions, and it can, of course, create economies of scale. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I also make the point that those who state that higher <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates, coupled with capital intensification, will lead automatically to higher unemployment should realise that historically Australia has been able to maintain near full employment at times of high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and increasing capital to labour ratios. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* But there are also a number of unknowns which could influence the nature of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* On balance, I support an expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program on both economic and non-economic grounds; but it must be implemented with caution, flexibility and good sense. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I also mention that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has to be framed within a long term perspective. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Some months ago the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  wrote to us and gave us guidelines as to what we were to say at those ceremonies, gently rapped our knuckles and said that we should not be political. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* In closing, I would hope that at some stage, instead of leaving it to the Galbally Committee, advisory councils and so on, we can have what the British Parliament has, namely, a parliamentary committee that looks at these questions of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs.

* There is a theory that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> adds to unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I am very pleased to know that in the past year or so, for a change, the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> question has been removed somewhat from the emotional area and the debate has become much more informed.

* A particular paper presented by Ainsley Jolley was headed The Macro Economics of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I believe that this is one of the signposts of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> debate and that people are beginning to realise just where and when in the trade cycle <span class="highlight">immigration</span> causes stresses or benefits on employment and other matters such as the balance of payments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Too often in this place debates on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> become emotional. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Sometimes people get up and say: 'If we have an increased level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> we are bound to have to that same extent an increase in the level of unemployment'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* If <span class="highlight">immigration</span> were to be used as a means of economic stabilisation there would be a need to cut <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at the peak of the trade cycle and increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at the beginning of economic recovery. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* One of the things that is spoken about in this paper is the fact that at the bottom of the trade cycle when there is an excess capacity <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the first instance tends to use up only that excess capacity, so the increased demand from the new immigrants will not add so much to employment levels and, therefore, may add to unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Even though I admit that perhaps at the bottom of the trade cycle <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will add less to demand than it would at the peak, there is a case to be made, perhaps more strongly than even Ainsley Jolley has put it, that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at all stages of the trade cycle will add to demand especially of course at the top of the trade cycle, and that is a time when <span class="highlight">immigration</span> perhaps needs to be cut. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* But when we are feeling the first very fragile commencement of a very solid movement forward in the Australian economy, now- right now- is, in my view, the time to increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> heavily in the way that it is apparently being done. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Often there is a feeling in the Australian community- certainly this applies in my electorate too- that a low level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a means of cutting back on unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* Many people forget, however, that a low level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is in many ways a contributor to our present condition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* It does need to be said that it was the previous Labor Government that apparently did not believe in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* It was the Government that cut back the levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which made it so difficult for qualified brothers and sisters of migrants already in Australia to enter this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I am very confident that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs sees it that way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I think it is quite wrong for the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Sainsbury)  to suggest that there was anything about the Labor Party when it was in office or in Opposition which could possibly suggest that the Labor Party was against <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or that it was against migrants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* I put it to honourable members that whilst the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations may have faced the facts about unemployment, we see reflected in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs an inability on the part of that Department to face that kind of reality. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* There is evidence that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is suggesting that in those circumstances, where we now have 6.2 per cent of the work force unemployed- by the new year, the percentage will be considerably higher- we ought to increase the rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which, I believe, will therefore increase the rate of unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* The direct effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for two decades (that is, excluding the inflows from Australian born children of migrants) was to contribute at least 40 per cent of the annual increase in the Australian labour force: Indeed in the 1950s the contribution would have been in excess of 50 per cent per year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* It is within that context that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in April of this year, was arguing for increasing the levels of migration from their current net levels of around 50,000 odd to 1 10,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* If one takes that figure of 27,000 contained in the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in June of this year, well after the parameters of the Budget had been set, and compares it with what the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations said in his statement of Thursday of last week, one finds a great difference. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43)

* The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs who, in April was advocating 1 10,000 immigrants a year and whose Department has an interest in the highest possible figures, is clearly in conflict with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations who has an interest in the lowest possible figures.

* The reason I bother to raise this matter is that, having had the benefit of visiting a number of countries during my journey to Europe, I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that the worst port in the world for people to get through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> clearances must be Melbourne Airport at Tullamarine.

* One of the recommendations- it is interesting because the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, is responsible for this particular area- that was not accepted by the Government was the ultimate purpose for which the departure tax should be used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0)

* 4472  (Hansard,  25 September 1979, page 1530) concerning the necessity for the use of the English language in incoming passenger cards and outgoing passenger cards, is it a fact that the words 'The card must be completed in the English language' appear on the back of each card and that the instructions are printed in the English language alone which might give rise to an inference that no other language will be understood by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials.
