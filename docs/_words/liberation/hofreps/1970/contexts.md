* For it is true - and this I apprehend is the real force of the views of the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  - that if the stakes were so vital in Vietnam that we were prepared to destroy that country, ready to risk nuclear war for it and tear our own communities apart rather than allow National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front participation in the government of Vietnam, then Cambodia was no less important.

* If the stage has been reached when the Government of South Vietnam can send 40,000 or 50,000 troops into Cambodia - another country - and 10,000 or 20,000 troops into Laos - another country - it should be expected that that Government has the power to establish order in a small province some 40 or 50 miles from Saigon, a province more than half of which has never at any stage been strongly influenced by National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front forces.

* This could be either through armed force or through some sort of peaceful merger, but there is not a shadow of a doubt that Communist Chinese policy is to liberate Taiwan, and we have lived long enough with wars of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> to know what they mean.
