* Yet changed circumstances have arisen which provide a new context for movements of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> and which made actions like that of the East Timorese possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0)

* Perhaps the white man is in greater need of <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, in greater need to be freed from fear and liberated from the threat which race and colour discrimination is to our future safety.

* As emerges from the Committee's inquiries, to a very large extent the conflict which took place within the Lebanon was a conflict between members of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and other people- indigenous people- living within the Lebanon.

* The Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation itself and every affiliated organisation within the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation- whether it is the El Fatah or  Mr Yasser  Arafat or the much more extreme organisation, the Popular Front for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Palestine- however they may differ on the methods they would apply to the elimination of the state of Isreal all of them are united in their belief that the State of Israel has no right to exist. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43)

* Nonetheless the fact remains that for as long as the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and the Arab countries continue to say that they will not recognise the existence of that state and that it is their objective to destroy it, I do not believe that one can object in any way to the Israelis continuing to occupy the West Bank and refusing to negotiate with the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43)

* In conclusion, I suggest that it should be the goal of those people who are friends of Israel, people who wish well and who do not wish ill to the Arab population of the Middle East, people who are trying to avoid bloodshed and to achieve peace in the area, to do two things: We should be urging on the Arab countries, and by whatever influence we can have on those countries which in turn influence the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, that there can be no peaceful settlement without their recognising the sovereignty of the state of Israel and its continued existence within secure boundaries.

* For a mixture of reasons, including, I think it is fair to say, the genuine humanitarian convictions of people such as  Mr Young,  the present United States Ambassador to the United Nations and probably  Mr Carter  and  Mr Mondale,  the United States feels sympathy for the various national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa- a sympathy which I do not doubt is accentuated by the fact that those people know that there is a 20 per cent non-white electorate inside the United States of America which would also have some views on this subject.

* In view of the incident for which the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation has claimed credit and about which it actually received the right to speak over the Australian Broadcasting Commission's national network last night, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he will consider the appropriateness of making representations to the appropriate organ of the United Nations to expel or cancel the recognition of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation as an observer to that body while ever these tactics of terrorism are boasted to be the achievement of the PLO?

* As I understand it, under resolution 33/41 of the General Assembly passed on 13 December 1978, all specialised agencies of the United Nations-that is, including the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund- were called on to increase their assistance to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements recognised by the Organisation of African Unity.

* That is an extraordinarily uninformative statement and does not amount at all to any justification for the highly unfortunate, unwarranted and, I would believe, unconscionable decision of the Australian Government, after very large sums of money had been spent on initial preparation for that conference, to abandon it simply because of the prospect of a visit from a Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation delegation.
