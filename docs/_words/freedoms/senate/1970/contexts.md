* The Minister for Health made it abundantly clear that the care of the health of the people was the prime consideration of the Government in this matter, and I have no doubt that the scheme, consistent with the proposals outlined in the Government's policy speech, will eventually emerge for the good health of the people of Australia and will be consistent with the responsibilities and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the medical profession, whatever those responsibilities be.

* And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, 'God Save The Queen', are perpetual reminders of these hard-won <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of Justice, [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0)

* As the editorial in today's 'Australian' said:  lt is a moratorium on 'business as usual' at home while a disastrous war continues in Vietnam; a harsh reminder of facts the Australian Government would prefer forgotten; an exercise of democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to express strongly-held convictions with due force.

* If we are to enjoy the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that we have in our Parliament which enable honourable senators to speak on matters to which they want to speak and which are not necessarily germane to the discussion current at that time, I believe that it is very desirable, in fact essential, that they should have the opportunity open to them by moving as a matter of urgency that the Senate at its rising adjourn until some time other than the normal time.

* I venture to suggest that someone who has the reputation of having done a great deal to ensure that there was no recognition and respect for the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of others and did not meet the just requirements of public order and the general welfare in a democratic society is someone who may well be not admitted to this country to carry on in the way in which he obviously has carried on in the United States.

* Therefore, insofar as the Democratic Labor Party has always supported the contention that reasonable charges should be borne by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, we have pressed accordingly for corresponding <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and liberties in the domestic, municipal and even Federal government areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0)

* Once an outside body uses that as a criterion to take action and is able to enforce this action then we can say goodbye to any concept of democratic parliamentary procedure, which is the very basis of the liberties and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and the national development of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0)

* We have heard a lot of noise from the House of Representatives .over the last year or two about bringing in legislation to protect the offshore areas of this country, but we do not see any suggestion that any of the laws are likely to be implemented, because they will restrict the business <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of some of the friends of the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0)

* At the same time it has to strike a sensible balance to ensure that those who wish to dissent and those who wish to demonstrate are protected and given that right so long as this does not mean that they interfere with the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0)

* Really I suppose that the necessity to make this loan available to the Shepparton Preserving Company in order to rescue this industry in its present circumstances is almost as great as the reasons which drive us to make available at rates of interest which are lower than those applying generally in the community money for the purpose of building homes for the men who served this country in the hours when our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> were being challenged. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-36-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2)

* Alternatively some explanation should be given of how this can be done in conformity with the Act in order that steps may be taken to ensure that what seems to be a breach of traditional <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of expression may be corrected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#debate-56)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0)

* The ALP imagines that the use of the word 'conscription'  will  stir people's emotions and will suggest that human <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> are being trampled upon by a ruthless government.

 Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONAN I can say that this is a free country and I have heard many people speak about <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, not only on our side of the chamber but also on the other side.

* I go further and say to you,  Mr Deputy President,  that unless this world can move into regional blocs that are meaningful, that will work together, that will learn to compromise, that will learn to respect the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of individual states, there will be no long term peace, there will be no meaningful working of world bodies such as the United Nations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0)

* As a black ban has been placed upon 5 farmers on Kangaroo Island by some trade unions because nonunion labour was employed during shearing, will the Attorney-General make inquiries to see whether any legal action can be taken to assist these farmers to defend their rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> against the militant actions of these trade unions? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0)

* I have become aware of the fact that black bans have been imposed by certain union organisations which apparently would deny to certain persons the right to engage in freedom of employment, which right has long been one of the things for which the trade union movement has fought.I think that not only is it a denial of ordinary <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of people to prevent them from continuing in their employment but also it is denial of what every Australian should regard as something basic to his country's future and something which he would desire to protect.

* All [ intended to say, and allI think I did say, in response to  Senator Young's  question was that boycotts and black bans are denials of essential <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> - denials which I believe all Australians abhor - and the easiest way of rectifying the wrong is for union members not to engage in black bans which deny to other persons the right to work.

* For many years I have agreed with  Senator Missen  who asked: Does the Bill of rights really produce something that is constructive, real and helpful to human <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0)

* To be critical of people who have expressed views along the lines expressed by  Senator Sheil  is easy, but quite frankly- I say this to some of my colleagues on the other side who were interjecting when  Senator Sheil  was speaking- I recognise the sensibility of those who openly admit that if we are to continue with our way of life, with our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, it may be necessary for there to be some legislation in Australia which infringes upon this covenant.

* Without full consultation and full knowledge and understanding of administration and operations on reserves, Community Councils can only be regarded as fronts for achieving goals which appear alien to the enjoyment of fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and human rights.
