[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0)

* But, beyond that, the making of a mandatory provision that State Ministers will give me a panel of names from whom I must choose people to exercise the prerogative of this Parliament under section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is not anything that has been required of any previous government in Australia and certainly is not a provision that our prececessors would have accepted from us.

* It is quite within contemplation that one of the Territories might become a State within the meaning of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* For instance, the founding fathers of Australia's <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> certainly would not have expected that after three-quarters of a century there would still be only 6 States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* In those circumstances I believe that the objective that we all have - that is, the giving of a vote on proposals to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to every elector qualified to vote for the House of Representatives - is best secured by removing the limitation contained in the words 'in each State'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* As this is a Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the provisions of section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> must be observed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Senate's amendments are not acceptable because they would remove the important provisions of the Bill that would enable the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to be altered by a national majority and a majority in not less than one half of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* These provisions are necessary because the existing requirement of Section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> (that the proposal to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> must be approved by a majority of States as well as a majority of electors voting) has proved a stumbling-block to desirable reforms, as evidenced by the history of proposals to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* The other point I wish to make is: Many of us who have listened to the debates in the House and to statements made outside the House should ask ourselves why the Labor Government wants to introduce any amendments at all, because it is well known that the Prime Minister has frequently said, 'We can never use the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as an alibi for not taking action'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* In addition, it may be that it is illegal as a contravention of section 48, sub-section 1, paragraph B of the Referendum (<span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration) Act, which prohibits publication or distribution of untrue or incorrect statements intended or likely to mislead any elector in his vote at a referendum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37)

* Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill and the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Mode of Altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>) Bill as they are all associated measures.

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, as amended in 1946, now places the emphasis on co-operation between federal and State governments for the purpose of giving effect to Conventions relating to matters appropriate, in whole or part, for state rather than federal action, and in this and other ways significant progress has been made in resolving the problem in respect of all the federal states except the United States; in Australia and Canada, in particular, there has been substantial progress.

* The Australian Government must give the lead here to get good planning from bureaucracies, such as the Department of Main Roads, by the provision of adequate environmental impact statements; to ensure that the State Government of New South Wales does likewise; and by giving more money to the States under section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> rather than by general loan funds to ensure that environmentally and socially equitable and sensible transport systems are developed in our cities.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0)

* Firstly, Section 123 and indeed also Section 128, which is the general referenda section, of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, prevents the Commonwealth from altering the limits of any State, including the maritime limits, without a nationwide referendum.

* But any attempt to pre-empt a court's power to decide the issue can only be regarded as an attempt to alter the boundaries of internal waters from some theoretical or posed standard, contrary to Section 123 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and will be ineffective in preventing litigation on whether or not there has been an alteration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0)

* Thirdly, there seems to be no clear and explicit reason from the terms of the only 2 relevant Acts - the Colonial Boundaries Act 1896 and the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> - to suggest the boundaries of Australia's internal waters were frozen at 1901.

* If the territorial sea were to be assimilated with the land territory and also held to belong to the States, the Commonwealth, in attempting to gain control over it, once more would be faced with the problem of infringing section 123 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* From communiques issued to us, it appeared that the meetings reached no agreement except an agreement not to try to solve the central matter at all and not to try to put the question of sovereignty beyond doubt by the only method open to this Parliament - passing legislation making an assertion and allowing the body set up under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to determine the matter to determine the matter.

* Putting those arguments to one side, I have heard no other argument advanced as to why a national parliament in which every Party represented asserted that the national Parliament has authority over these water* - and every Party in this place asserts that - but which is challenged by State counter-claims should not take action to make that assertion a fact and test it in the proper way as is laid down in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* While no formal decision has been taken in the matter it can be said that the Government, bearing in mind the provisions of Section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, favours the principle of providing representation for the Territory commensurate with its development and its population growth, but it considers that the present time is not appropriate to introduce senatorial representation for each Territory as proposed by the Bill.

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> further provides for an initial number of 6 senators but that the Parliament could make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each State but that equal representation of the States was to be maintained and no original State could have less than 6 senators.

* On the basis of advice by the Commonwealth legal advisers, the provision for Territory senators by virtue of Section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> does not cause an alteration in the number of members of the House of Representatives by virtue of Section 24.

* The Government's legal advice is that section 24 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> does not have application in relation to senators who may be provided for a Territory under the provisions of section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0)

* In other words, the requirement contained in section 24 for the number of members of the House of Representatives to be as nearly as practicable twice the number of senators does not relate to Territory members or senators provided under section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* First of all as to the constitutional validity of the proposal, speaking as a layman on a legal matter, in contradistinction to my learned friends the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  and the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who have put arguments to the House, as I read it section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> allows the representation of a Territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which the Parliament thinks fit.

* This is the fundamental constitutional law of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0)

* So it could be said that the new senators will not be senators in terms of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> because the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> lays down quite specifically in section 7 that senators are chosen directly by the people of the State.

* The whole of the history of the provisions relating to the dissolution of the Senate hinge on the fact that if Bills are rejected twice by the Senate and it appears that the will of the majority of the people - the popular will - is in any way being frustrated, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> enables those provisions to start to move and it enables the country to be kept in a measure of stability.

* What is being proposed by the Labor Government today is a significant attempt to undermine the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> not for the sake of convenience - if mere convenience were the argument here we could meet it rapidly in 3 or 4 months' time - but to undermine the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in a way which, frankly, I do not think the Government quite comprehends.

* Rather, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> will be strengthened, for capricious government, which can be brought about by a Senate's rejecting legislation that has been passed by an elected House of Representatives, can have the effect of lowering the respect in which the public holds the Parliament and the legislative process.

* Therefore, it will still be possible to have a double dissolution regardless of whether the question proposed to be put at the referendum that will be conducted if this Bill is passed is carried and an alteration made to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* The Committee has recommended (19S8 Report, paragraph 49) that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> be altered to omit the provision now made for senators to be chosen for terms of six years and to provide instead that senators should hold their places until the expiry or dissolution of the second House of Representatives after their election, unless the Senate should be earlier dissolved under the provisions of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0)

* As part and parcel of the exercise of the bicameral system, under our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the Government represents the party with the majority in the lower House and the party with the majority in the lower House at any House of Representatives election need not have a majority in the upper House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0)

* So there is a flexibility within the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which enables the Government to go to the people and seek another mandate through its majority in the House of Representatives, to go to the people by way of a double dissolution or to go to the people by way of an election for the House of Representatives at the time of the normal 3- yearly election for half the members of the Senate.

* Instead of achieving its policy objective in a valid way - instead of turning to section 53 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and looking at the exercise of power as it is applied to the Senate in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> - it is seeking to do so in a backhand way.

* The major ground, apart from the fact that what was proposed was Labor Party policy and had been uttered at that Constitutional Convention so that plenty of notice was given of our intention, was that the legislation seeks to carry out a unanimous recommendation made in 1959 by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review.

* One would think that if the Australian people wished to change their form of <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> from a federal to a unitary system, the right way to do this would be for a government to come out and state plainly what it wished to do, give the arguments in favour of what it wished to do and finally, by referendum, put it to the people instead of seeking to do it by stealth.

* The purpose of this Bill is to amend Section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the provision in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which lays down the way in which the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself can be amended.

* The need to change the emphasis by amending section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> has been felt for years; but like so much else, including the second proposal I will put in a moment, nothing - I say nothing - was done by our predecessors in office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0)

* But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original six States, means in the elegant words of the Constitutional Review Committee that 'for every State in which there is an adverse vote there must be a favourable vote in two States ... a constitutional change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States.'

* We believe that the two changes to section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> contained in this Bill will put referendums on a more democratic basis and make it more possible for the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to reflect more accurately, in contemporary terms, the spirit and the fact of Australia as one united nation.

* With one exception, none of the powers proposed to be transferred by the referendum will benefit the people of this country in a personal way, as was done in 1946 in the amendment, by referendum, to section 51 (XXIII  a)  of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which conferred power on the Australian Parliament to make provision for such benefits as child endowment, unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits and family allowances.

* That is the question of whether or not the Commonwealth has legal and constitutional powers to introduce such referendum legislation which touch and concern powers and functions that are clearly within and remain within the jurisdiction of the States, and are related almost exclusively to electoral matters involving the States.

* So far as I can ascertain, the new paragraph is local in origin but the words 'shall be as nearly as practicable the same' have been taken out of the Labor Party's platform, which in turn were taken from an interpretation of Article 1 section 2 paragraph (i) of the United States <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which, insofar as it is relevant, says: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0)

* If this legislation is passed, if the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is altered and then legislation is passed pursuant to that power, it will be to the great disadvantage of the people of Australia who want the services, and it will be to the great disadvantage also of those people of Australia who see our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as a bulwark which is essential for the protection of our standards, our way of life and our democratic centralisation of power in Canberra.

* One may indulge in the luxury of seeking to agree with him in some respects, but what puzzles me on this occasion about the Government which the honourable gentleman leads is the impatience, having regard to the fact that a <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Convention was held in Sydney a short time ago and that at that Convention, with the agreement of all of the States and with the agreement of the Commonwealth delegation, of which the Prime Minister was the distinguished leader, committees were set up to investigate various areas of constitutional reform.

* Let me put this proposition to the House: If at the time of Federation in the 1890s the proposal had been that a simple majority of electors voting at a referendum would be adequate means of altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the Federation would never have come into existence.

* I find it somewhat odd, in view of the fact that this provision in the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> is to come under very careful scrutiny by the standing committee of the Constitutional Convention, that the honourable member proposes that we should ask the Commonwealth Parliament to put before the people a referendum in advance of the decision of the constitutional committee.

* Using 'federal' in its primary sense, the general difference between the federal and national elements of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the Commonwealth may be thus defined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* Basically, section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides that an amendment of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> requires the assent of an absolute majority of the members of both Houses of Parliament, of a majority of electors in a majority of the States, and of a majority of electors overall.

* I will not refer again to the 2 alterations sought to section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> because they were dealt with in the second reading speech and by a majority of the speakers in this debate, but I shall make 2 observations on the proposed alteration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* The first is that no ordinary, but an absolute majority, of the members of the Houses of Parliament is required to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>; secondly, that the people have a voice in altering their fundamental law; and thirdly, some reference is made to the States, although it is submitted that this latter principle should at least partially give way to an approach which primarily considers the electorate as a national entity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I have said this previously, and I will repeat it: It is paradoxical to find that Switzerland, the country whose procedures most resemble Australia's - that is, an amendment passed by Parliament, by a majority of votes, in a majority of cantons and a majority overall - has had, in contrast to Australia, the greatest number of constitutional amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* After all, with a <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so manifestly inadequate, popular reticence towards change cannot be merely an expression of satisfaction with the status quo. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* Unless as a first step we can change the procedure for amending the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and unless we can make the procedures more flexible and positive, our chances of amending the rest of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> are extremely slight indeed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* To their credit they came up with a pretty good <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> for their time, but surely they would have been the last people to argue that the result of their combined labours was to fix a codification of constitutional law which was to remain inflexible, immutable and binding upon all generations for all time.

* To seek to alter that <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in a manner which is not clearcut is, in my view, a clear attempt to deceive the people because when this matter comes before the Australian people for a vote there is nothing in the title of the Bill which refers to the 2 ways in which the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is proposed to be altered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* But in relation to this very contentious question of changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in respect of a majority of the States, clause 2 (c) seeks to omit the words 'in a majority of the States' and to substitute the words 'in not less than one-half of the States'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* That seems to me to be a very good example of how, if the Government was really sincere in its wish to have these alterations made to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, it could bring its aim about, that is, by separating the questions contained in this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* Not only would this in my mind be a more reasonable way, a more honest way, a more direct way and a more clear cut way of presenting the alternative propositions to the Australian people but also it would probably have the very real effect of giving the Australian people the opportunity of voting in favour of the measure proposing a constitutional change to give electors in the Territories the opportunity to vote at a referendum and also to express their opinion on the second proposal contained in this Bill.

* Whether it be on 8 December when the people of Australia are considering a referendum on another matter or whether it be on another occasion when they consider the referendum which will flow from the Bill that is now before the chamber, the people of Australia must be conscious that each one of these measures is not presented just for the overt change of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in the way that the Bills suggest but rather in a covert fashion to ensure that additional powers can be exercised in Canberra. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* There is no justification for us in this Parliament to say arbitrarily to the States: 'We will no longer give you as States the opportunity through the application of section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to have a separate right in determining whether the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> should be changed'.

* It will be remembered by honourable members that on at least 2 occasions in discussions of other Bills relating to referenda we have drawn attention to the fact that there are sentences in various sections of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which provide that, until the Parliament or some other institution otherwise provides, there is a <span class="highlight">constitution</span> requirement as to the law that shall prevail. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I admit that there is little doubt that the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> has been found difficult to amend in practice and that since 1901 there have been something of the order of 26 proposals to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> but only five of them have been approved by the people of this country.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* It would mean in effect that there would be an amendment to that section of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which requires that before a referendum can be successful it must be approved by a majority of all the electors and by a majority of electors in 4 States out of 6 States.

* We have pointed out also that the reason this section was initially incorporated in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was, firstly, to sustain the Federal <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and secondly, to ensure mature consideration of the proposal and settlement relating to organic changes of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* The Opposition believes also that when there is a compact, such as in the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, between the States, the Commonwealth and the people, the people should be given ample opportunity to make up their minds, and they should be thoroughly briefed not only as to the meaning of the changes, but also as to the consequences that might flow from those changes.

* In other words, if honourable members read Quick and Garran and understand the constitutional principles and the realities of a federal and democratic system that guided the fathers of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, they must come to the conclusion that before a referendum is put to the Australian people they must be informed of exactly what is involved in the proposed change.

* Instead of requiring a majority of States, which at present means 4 out of 6 States and thus a two-thirds majority of the States, what the Government is proposing is that a majority of voters in not less than half the States will be necessary for the carriage of an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, as well, of course, as an overall majority of voters in the whole of the continent.

* Shortly before the suspension of the sitting I moved an amendment to clause 2 (c) of the Bill, the effect of which, if it had been agreed to by the Committee, would have been to retain in section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the wordsin a majority of the States' and to prevent the substitution of the words 'in not less than one-half of the States'.

* Nevertheless I do not think he would really expect many honourable members to be so naive, innocent and guileless as to believe that this third or fourth attempt to alter the long title of the current <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> alteration Bill would have any significance other than to complicate the ballot paper, and any purpose other than to confuse the electors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0)

* I support the form of the original Bill, particularly clause 2 (a), which would omit the words 'in each State' from section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, thus allowing Territorians, in both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, to have their votes counted at a referendum.

* I said then that I believed that, far from facilitating changes in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the Bill made changes much easier to make or, if I may put it in different language - language used in the 'Reasons' which were prepared by the Prime Minister in the few seconds which were available to him - the Labor Party wants the change because the form in which section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is drafted has proved to be a stumbling block. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* In other words, the Government wants to remove any sort of a block to constitutional change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* In a Federal <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> we must accept the fact that we are trustees for that <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and we should not lightly make changes to section 128 or, for that matter, to any other section of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, unless we find in that <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> sections which have to be dealt with satis factorily in order to ensure that the federal system is maintained during the period the people want it maintained and we ensure that the people have the opportunity for consideration in the way I have mentioned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29)

* The other proposal, which is not objected to, also involves an amendment to section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to allow the voters in the Territories to be counted in the national total which must be obtained in favour of any proposed law to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as well as a majority in not less than half of the States.

* Perhaps I can conclude with this thought: This is one case where the Senate cannot prevent the people expressing their voice because if, after another 3 months, we put this Bill and the attendant Constitutional Alteration Bills through the House and the Senate again rejects them, shelves them or unacceptably amends them, then without any limitation of time the Bill can be put to the people.

* Clearly, this is a case envisaged by section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which deals with the mode of altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, whereby this House passes a proposed law for the alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by an absolute majority and the other House passes it with amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree.

* Only recently many Queenslanders were dismayed at the ruthlessness with which the Bjelke-Petersen Government - apparently the honourable member for Darling Downs thinks that great democratic government in Queensland is a wonderful government - bludgeoned through the State Assembly a resolution opposing the conferral of powers sought by this Federal Government under section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The fact is that when the word grant' is used in this House it is used within the context of section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which enables the Australian Government to make funds available to the States for such purposes and on such conditions as it may specify.

* Having said that and having drawn the attention of the House to the quite specific and undeniable usage of the word 'grant' as it is understood by all persons concerned with implementing the provisions of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, I should like to go on and say that this Government, unlike any of its predecessors stretching back as far as Federation, does recognise the very heavy debt burdens of local government and semi-government authorities and the inhibitions which the debt burden imposes on these authorities in providing the services which Australians have come to expect of them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0)

* I am at a loss to know what are those constitutional reasons because as I recall the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> it provides for Ministers and members of Parliament in pretty much the same way - that is, that Ministers will be provided with salaries which, until the Parliament otherwise determines, shall be a given amount. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0)

* The Labor Party knows that many of the things it wants to put to the Australian people in referendums will be rejected, as they should be, but it hopes that by lowering the threshold, by making it easier to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, it might be able to get some of its changes through.

* The Whitlam Government sees the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> not as a charter but as a constraint to its political objectives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29)

* In short, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill is not simply unnecessary but also is cunningly deceptive in its intent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill is equally deceptive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Mode of Altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>) Bill seeks to change the present requirement that, before a referendum can succeed, a majority of the electors in a majority of the States must vote in favour of the proposal; that is, there must be a majority of electors in four of the six States and also a majority of all electors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29)

* The Minister for Services and Property, while speaking on this Bill on 21 November 1973, referred to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in deprecating terms as a 72-year old document out of line with the social and political realities of this day and age.

* So that in regard to the fifth Bill which is dealt with by this motion, the Constitutional Alternation (Inter-change of Powers) Bill 1974, we have a fairly solid body of opinion presented by the members of the Constitutional Convention at the executive level and at the sub-committee level suggesting that they do not agree with the actions of this Government.

* I believe that if the Queensland State AWU is in fact a living State organisation now with its properly elected officers and with its membership in accordance with its registered <span class="highlight">constitution</span> and eligibility rule, then it follows that Bowman Building and Dunstan House and all of the property in Queensland held in the name of the AWU in that State is the property of the State union, not the property of the federal union.

* Despite differences in the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> rule of the federal and the corresponding State body, members of one who are not eligible to be members of the other are often treated as members of both and often vote in elections of the body to which they are not entitled to belong.

* It is often forgotten that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> could have simply given to the Commonwealth the power to make laws to deal with industrial disputes when they were national in character, leaving it to the Parliament of the day, as time moved on, to decide whether a system of compulsory arbitration was the best method of settling industrial disputes, whether a system of collective bargaining was the best method, or whether some other system of industrial regulation would bring the required measure of industrial peace.

* So we have this strange provision of the Constitutionthat is, strange by contrast with the other provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which grant a general power to the Commonwealth- which actually limits the way in which the Parliament of the Commonwealth can legislate to make laws for a system of preventing and settling industrial disputes.

* If it is not settled that union will be fragmented and nothing that its Federal council or convention can do will ever stick; nothing that it can decide by way of Federal convention or executive council will have any validity because those bodies are improperly constituted and will remain improperly constituted until their present <span class="highlight">constitution</span> and rules are validated by this legislation.

* It depends upon their conviction, in 2-Party democracies such as our own, that when a Party wins an election and comes to office it will be allowed to put its policies into effect and that it will enjoy the protection not only of the letter of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> but also of the great body of convention and tradition which has been accumulated in the parliaments of the English speaking world.

* In the United States of America, whose <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> enshrines the domocratic rights of the individual to an extent which is almost beyond belief in a modern society and which is the cause of some problems in that country, the rights of the individual are totally protected and there is no question that the Supreme Court of the United States would upset any attempt to take away from any individual his rights of secret ballot and his rights to participate properly in an election.

* Having said that, let me say that I would express the view that the Prime Minister's anxiety to go about constitutional reform and the manner in which he has sought to prosecute what I regard as being strongly held convictions have been in the ultimate resulted in setting back genuine constitutional reform in this country by 20 to 25 years.

* All that is being proposed by the Bill is that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> should be altered and instead of stating that a senator should enjoy 3 years or 6 years in this Parliament it should provide that he should enjoy as long in this Parliament in time as 2 terms of the House of Representatives.

* Even my eloquent and learned friend, the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  whom I usually listen to with great interest when he speaks on matters of law, and I hope I learn something from him, on this occasion disillusioned me, because even he, with his eloquence and with his knowledge of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and of constitutional law, could not show me a good reason why elections ought to be held on separate days, why one half of the Parliament ought to be treated differently from the other half.

* What it proposes to do is to destroy the fixed term of tenure of membership of the Senate now given by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and to put in its place a variable term that is dependent upon the whim of the Government of the day as to when the House of Representatives will be dissolved, because by this Bill the term of a senator shall be equal to 2 terms of the House of Representatives and by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which will not be altered in this respect by this Bill, the House of Representatives may be dissolved at any time by the Governor-General within 3 years of the election most recently past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* If the Government were to put forward a proposal by which it would give to members of the House of Representatives a fixed term of office and then double that period so as to render the term of office of senators also fixed there might be some merit in that proposition because that is the situation arising under the United States <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> whereby members of the House of Representatives have a fixed term of office of 2 years and members of the Senate have a term of office of 4 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* That renders a fundamental alteration in constitutional terms of the system of government upon which our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is based because our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is based on the convention of the Westminster system whereby the House of Representatives may be dissolved at any time by the Governor-General, as the delegate of the Queen, upon the advice of the government of the day. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* The honourable gentleman, with the greatest respect to him, simply has not read the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> because as section 28, which I have just read to the House, points out the House may be dissolved within 3 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* So the effect of acceptance of the proposal to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to bring about simultaneous elections will be to maintain the provision that the House of Representatives can be dissolved at any time by the Governor-General and, when that dissolution occurs, automatically the Senate shall be dissolved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* If that be so, why does the Government- the Prime Minister in particular because he is the one who seems to be so anxious to bring forward these matters of constitutional reform- not at the same time seek to amend section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which contains the double dissolution provisions? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* If this proposal to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is passed, there would never be a need for the double dissolution provisions to operate, because if the Government had one of its pieces of legislation, upon which it regarded its authority as a Government depended, rejected by the Senate, it could immediately go to the Governor-General and advise him to dissolve the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* I would not have thought that any parliament would want a <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which becomes something of a patchwork quilt of constitutional provisions, and this is what would happen if a proposal such as this altering just one part of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was not followed by complementary and necessary alterations to other parts of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* There is expressed explicitly in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> a balance of power between each institution of government- the Parliament, with its 2 parts, the Senate and the House of Representatives; the executive government drawn, in the Westminister tradition, from that parliament; and the judicature, separate from parliament and the executive.

* Looking at the matter in practical terms, as has already been pointed out in this debate, there is a ready means by which this Government can bring about simultaneous elections by calling a House of Representatives election- that is, by calling that election, pursuant to the authority of section 28 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, at the same time as the next Senate election which must be held before 30 June 1 976.

* If the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is so fond of relying on the statements and actions of  Sir Robert  Menzies in justifying his own constitutional statements and the constitutional position that he so frequently adopts these days, let him do what  Sir Robert  Menzies did in 1955.

* He would not distort the framework of government, which is so wonderfully written into the present <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and he would maintain the excellence of it as a balanced framework of government where each institution has its place clearly expressed by the present <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* I think on balance that it does considerable violence to the role of the Australian Senate, as it has now evolved, to remove from the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the built in proviso that except in the case of a double dissolution, a person elected to the Senate shall serve a period of not less than 6 years.

* I think that of the many issues that have characterised the Whitlam Government in its slightly more than 2 years of office, one that has really categorised it is its mania for seeking to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, its mania for trying to alter the ground rules under which elections in this country are conducted.

* It is interesting to reflect upon the fact that when the Australian delegation went to the United Kingdom 75 years ago to present to the members of the Imperial Parliament the draft of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the central point of contention between the Australian delegation and the British authorities surrounded the question of the Privy Council.

* It may be influenced by the federal or unitary nature of the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> and whether it is written or unwritten, by the legislative procedure in Parliament, by the ease with which parliamentary time can be found to effect amendments in the law which concern only a small minority of citizens, by the extent to which Parliament has been in the habit of intervening to reverse judicial decisions by legislation; but most of all by the underlying political philosophy of the particular nation as to the appropriate limits of the lawmaking function of a non-elected judiciary.

* The degree to which there was co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in determining changes within the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was dependent very considerably upon the success of that Convention It is now history that the Government has successively initiated a number of referenda which have been defeated by the Australian electorate and which sought, without the consent of the States, to change the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The prediction by the then Governor-General,  Sir Paul  Hasluck, that the Constitutional Convention might result in a monumental flop regrettably and tragically has come to pass as the product of this Labor Government being prepared to assert its interpretation of what should be the changes in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> without reference to the Australian people and without their consent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that section 73 of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides:   no exception or regulation prescribed by the Parliament shall prevent the High Court from hearing and determining any appeal from the Supreme Court of a State in any matter in which at the establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal lies from such Supreme  Court  to the Queen in Council.

* But with regard to the second point, it is certainly true that it is necessary at a time when there is a suspicion by the States as to the intentions of this Government in the application and creation of laws as well as in the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the High Court, that they should not be prepared to accept that the High Court should be the ultimate determinant of any of the laws that they might pass and that they should forgo the right of ultimate appeal to the Privy Council.

* The second point which makes me concerned about this Bill- this is the reason why I support my honourable and learned friend, the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  in his opposition to this Bill- is my worry about the degree to which I see this Bill as a device to change the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, not by recognised procedures that are set down within the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> but by a procedure on which there has been comment and which has been, at least to date, not regarded as being an acceptable procedure by an Australian government.

* Having said that, I am asserting my own point of view, which is that I believe it necessary that we progressively accept that there has been a change since this <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was adopted and that, today, there is justification in the High Court being the ultimate body to determine all matters pertaining to the legal system within this country and the interpretation of laws which might be passed by any government within Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* For that reason, I am concerned at the degree to which the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself is being avoided and the Statute of Westminister pursued in order to seek that constitutional change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* I believe that it is true that, within the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, we should take cognisance of placitum (xxxvii) of section 51, being the reference of powers placitum, and section 128, that being the other manner within which there can be constitutional change within the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and determine the degree to which we see that as the fundamental basis by which the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> should be changed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* Section 128 contains provisions for altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by referendum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* So section 128 and section 51 (xxxvii) provide the basic forms for alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> laid down by our forebears- those who agreed to this Federal <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* The Constitutional Convention did not suggest that those forms were unexceptional even to the present Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* Yet we find tonight that through this piece of legislation the Government seeks to avoid those 2 prescribed and acceptable forms for changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by reference back to section 4 of the Statute of Westminster of 1931. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* That section is the form by which there can be an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, designed with the request and consent of the Australian Parliament to enact legislation, which can specifically change the provisions which are now the ultimate sanctuary of the rights of the individual in this country- the sanctuary provided by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* If this Government wished to introduce the High Court as being the ultimate court of appeal it was open for it to achieve that end through consultation and co-operation within that Constitutional Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* It is not open to it to pursue the exceptions to changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which the Statute of Westminster provides. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* It seems to me quite strange that in such an anomalous fashion we should tonight be considering such an anachronistic form for changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* The opposition believes that if there is to be any change it should be within the terms provided in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* I would like to add my support to the request made of the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  by the honourable member for Moreton that, if he is genuine in his belief that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> should be the ultimate sanctuary for laws within this Parliament, perhaps it is the time, if there is to be any request of the Parliament of Westminster, to ask for the repeal of that section to which I have just referred. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* Indeed what he is doing in this legislation- by a subterfuge which avoids the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>- is severing the tie which the States preserve in order that they may retain some residual "sovereignty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* For those  3  reasons- the fact that the States have a right and responsibility to maintain their independence to the maximum; the degree to which this Bill seeks through reference to the Statute of Westminster and not by the forms provided in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself; and the fact that the Prime Minister only the other day stated that Australia accepts without reservation the judgments of the International Court- this Bill should be totally rejected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* Here in confidence some leaders and some spokesmen from the Liberal and Country Parties on the Opposition benches will say: 'Of course, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> needs to be changed by referendum'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* Oh no, that might mean changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in some way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* As distinct from the steps which have been employed to bring about- so that the Government hopes- the abolition of appeals from State courts to the Privy Council, the process which the Government has employed on this occasion is correct and constitutional. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* In return there was an implicit understanding, written as far as possible into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia, that in no circumstances would that delicate balance of power between the Federal government and the State governments be disturbed except by the consent not only of the majority of the Australian people but also by the consent of the majority of the States which formed that Federation and entered into that compact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* Included in the constitutional history of Australia is not only the Act of the Imperial Parliament which became our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> but also the document known as the Statute of Westminster. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* I do not accept the proposition advanced by the Attorney-General in the earlier debate, that the Statute of Westminsterhis speech implied it- conferred some new method of altering the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> on the Imperial Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* At no stage during the Federation debates was it ever intended that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia should be altered in any way other than by the referendum procedure laid down in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and which we all understand so very wen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* So far from section 4 of the Statute of Westminster delineating a new method of altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia the purpose of that section was to put to rest the fears that the then dominion governments had that the British Parliament might not have surrendered for aU time the right it had hitherto asserted to pass laws which had application to Australia and the other constituent parts of the then British Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* It has been argued in aid of the Government's moves in respect of abolition of appeals from State courts that this section historically was put in to provide another device for altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* I suggest that it does violence to our constitutional history and to our understanding of the circumstances which produced the Statute of Westminster and, most importantly of aU, it does violence to the very thing that the Government has so often tried to assert since it came to government- to try to alter the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by any method other than that described in that document. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* However, the Bm that we are now debating is of a different kind, because in respect of this Bill the Parliament is seeking to exercise the power that it has under section 74 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to make laws limiting the matters in which leave to appeal to the Privy Council may be sought. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* The important thing to which I would draw attention m this debate is the fact that the legal authority which this Government seeks to rely on in the present Bill, namely, section 74 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, is not available to it in respect of the Bill to abolish appeals to the Privy Council from the State Supreme Courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* Yet we have the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia, which again he is so fond of using as authority for his stand on the constitutional proposition that he so often propounds before this Parliament, giving to this Parliament supremacy in respect of appeals to the Privy Council from the High Court; but it deliberately does not give that same supremacy in respect of appeals to the Privy Council from the State Supreme Courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* The importance of the distinction is this: Whilst the Government can simply and quickly turn to the authority of section 74 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and the supremacy of Parliament in respect of appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council, it must seek some other legal authority in order to give effect to its view that there should not be such a thing as an appeal from a State Supreme Court directly to the Privy Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Prime Munster cannot bring himself to recognise the subtlety of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in this field. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* Particularly he cannot bring himself to recognise that, at the same time as all States are bound by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> into one indissoluble union, that is, into the Australian nation, they also draw legal authority in significant ways directly from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* It derives its legal authority from section 74 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, but we see a distortion brought upon the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, a violence upon the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> if you like, by the methods that the Prime Minister has sought to use in respect of his proposal to abolish appeals from the State courts to the Privy Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* So it is a pity in a matter of this kind, which is important because of the impact that the proposals will have upon the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia, that the Government should gag the debate on the first Bill and no doubt, after I have spoken, gag the debate on this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0)

* I do that in this House because I consider that matters of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> should not be abdicated by this House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* Too often this House leaves constitutional matters to be debated by the other House of this Parliament and in other places outside this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* I also enter this debate because I feel that, having regard to what has been written in the Press, what has been said privately and what has been said in another place, much has been left to be desired with regard to the constitutional perspective with which this whole question must be approached. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* I refer to that 'Address to the Nation' particularly because the Prime Minister called in aid his concept of democracy and his concept of what the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia required in the filling of this casual vacancy created by the elevation of  Mr Justice  Murphy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* Executive Council of Australia constituted under and by virtue of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* It is not simply the constitutional practice, because that does not pay due regard to the principle; but the constitutional requirement is that the GovernorGeneral, being the delegate of the Queen, Will act on the advice of the executive government of the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* In respect of the filling of the casual vacancy, again I do not express any personal opinion, because I do not think that is relevant to the constitutional propriety of what the Government of New South Wales proposes to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* Section 15 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides that where there is a casual vacancy, when the Houses of the Parliament of the State for which the senator was chosen are sitting those Houses of Parliament shall sitting and voting together, choose a person to fill that vacancy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* The important aspect about this provision is that, by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia, the will of the people, if we wish to put it in those terms, is expressed in this vacuum of a casual vacancy by the Houses of the Parliament of the State constituted by the individuals elected to those Houses by the constitutional processes of that State, and those Houses of the Parliament then have entrusted to them in aU the acts that they perform the expression of the Will of the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* The Constitutional assumption is that in the decision of those Houses the will of the people is expressed and thereby the trust of the people is put into effect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* The next constitutional process is that that decision imposed upon the Houses of the Parliament in trust for the people of the State must be put before a general election of members of the House of Representatives or at the next election of senators for the State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* In that way democracy is at work as fully and amply as one could expect under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* So democracy, by virtue of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the Commonwealth of Australia works in 2 ways in this process. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* Firstly, the people at the next election at which that person must be put forward can accept or reject the person chosen by the Houses of the Parliament of the State and, further than that, the people may, at the next election of the members of Parliament of that State, cast their opinion as to the constitutional propriety or, if we Uke to put it in rather baser terms the political propriety of what the Houses of the Parliament of that State did. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* I cannot think of any better way in which democracy in this country can work than by processes which are written expressly into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* So, whatever the private or political opinions of members of the Opposition or the people of Australia as to the elevation of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Murphy to the High Court, whatever might be the private or political opinions as to what the Government of New South Wales proposes to do, no criticism can be made of either of those acts in terms of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31)

* We are constrained by our present Federal <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to leave the final disposition of many matters in the hands of lawyers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0)

* We are forbidden to do not so much what the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> forbids us to do but what the judges forbid us to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0)

* But the present Liberal Leader says that there is nothing in the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">constitution</span> which permits him to influence State Liberal leaders; there is nothing in the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which permits him to influence State Liberal leaders; and of course there is nothing in the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">constitution</span> which permits him to influence Country Party leaders, whether they are in a State parliament or in this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-8-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* I also spoke of the constitutional propriety of the proposal of the Government of New South Wales to act in accordance with the requirements of section 15 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in having a joint sitting of the 2 Houses of the New South Wales Parliament to select a person to fill the casual vacancy created by the elevation of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Murphy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* The difference is that the United Kingdom does not have a written <span class="highlight">constitution</span> and therefore no piece of legislation may be declared by the judiciary in the United Kingdom to be constitutionally invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* That is an important distinction because the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia gives to the High Court the authority to declare legislation constitutionally invalid by reason of the fact that the legislation does not fall within any of the expressed powers given by. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* So there is no opportunity in the United Kingdom for law to be declared constitutionally invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* There can be no doubt that the Prime Minister in advising the Governor-General pursuant to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to appoint the then  Senator Murphy  to the High Court took every political advantage at his command and given to him by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia to appoint his own AttorneyGeneral to the High Court at a time when the Prime Minister knew that a number of pieces of legislation introduced by his Government and passed by this Parliament, either in the ordinary way of passing legislation or after a joint sitting of the 2 Houses, are subject to litigation in the High Court on the grounds that they are constitutionally invalid as not falling within the powers of the Commonwealth under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0)

* I should say that there is prima facie evidence of this and it occurs in the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the Australian Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19)

* The honourable member for Corio was quite right when he said that this is the kind of thing that the Privileges Committee should investigate, because if the claims of the Federal Executive as set out in the printed <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the Party are correct, then every member of the Labor Party who adheres to it and is under discipline is doing an infamous thing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19)

* There is therefore substantial evidence that members of this House attending that conference under that <span class="highlight">constitution</span> agree to that <span class="highlight">constitution</span> and agree that they are under the direction of that conference, and I have heard the Prime Minister admit in this House that he was under the direction of that conference.

* In the meantime they get no assistance from their colleagues in this Parliament, because one does not know whether the Liberals, from the top to the bottom, or the National Country Party of Australia either for that matter, want the RED scheme to be expanded or scaled down, or whether they think it is unconstitutional.

* We also know that on 2 December 1972- not yet 3 years ago, and yet the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> states that the House of Representatives should be elected for 3 years- the people of Australia chose a majority of members of the Australian Labor Party to govern in this House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26)

* We know that in that place a majority of senators decided that in May 1974, before the 3 years required by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> were up, they would take the people of Australia to another election.

* I said at that time, and I repeat it, that the Governor-General should have dismissed both the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the then Attorney-General, former  Senator Murphy,  from their positions because they had so contravened the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> that their actions set at nought the essence of democracy about which in this debate Government members have been speaking.

* I suggest that if the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> had been drawn up about 12 or 15 years later than it was the situation we have at the moment would not have occurred, because about 1910 or 1911 after a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom the House of Lords had the power to refuse money taken away from it- or it agreed by virtue of the circumstances that it could not refuse money to the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26)

* The Constitutional Convention which assembled in September 1973 also considered this matter and referred it to one of its committees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0)

* I believe that committee has also recommended that it should be a matter of convention as distinct from constitutional amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself does not do that and while there has been some legislation introduced by the Minister for Services and Property which identifies political parties in the same way as political parties have been identified in much legislation in other countries, including federal countries, I believe there have not been any constitutional provisions of that character yet devised.

* He is silent Yet, if we put up a referendum proposal to change an aspect of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in any way, it is predictable and certain that his Party, the Liberal Party, and also the National Country Party, will oppose that referendum proposal on every pretext or another and you will frighten Australians into saying no.

* The proposed <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> alteration before the House will remedy this position by making it quite clear that a reference given by the States will be revocable, that it may be given subject to conditions, including conditions regulating the kinds of laws that may be passed in pursuance of it, and may be made for a limited period of time.

* The other important thing that the proposed <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> alteration will do is to make the powers of reference mutual: That is to say, it will authorise references, which for technical reasons are described in the Bill as 'designations', of powers by the Australian Government to the States.

* The premier of Victoria,  Mr Hamer,  said that he welcomed the proposal as a distinct improvement on the situation and one which would make the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself a great deal more flexible and responsive than it has been in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0)

* The leader of the Tasmanian delegation,  Mr Everett,  Q.C., expressed his confidence that the Tasmanian delegation would strongly support the proposal and that he believed the Commonwealth's offer was a landmark in the reconception of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and that history would applaud it.

* I am not advocatingindeed the Opposition does not advocate- that the situation should be otherwise, but if the Government is so committed to a principle of one vote one value why does it not, to be consistent, initiate some amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to cover that situation?

* If the National Country Party and the Liberal Party continue in their operations in regard to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and in their opposition to electoral reform and in the manner they have conducted themselves over the last year there is a fair chance that the processes of democracy in Australia as we know them in this Parliament will not survive.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0)

* Honourable members will be aware that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for a referendum to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the Commonwealth by inserting in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> two new sections to be known, if the referendum is carried, as sections 108A and 108B. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* In summary, the effect of these two proposed sections is intended to clarify the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to refer powers under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to the State parliaments and, conversely, to clarify the power of the State parliaments to confer on the Commonwealth Parliament residual powers that the States have. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I would ask the Government to consider that in respect of this Bill there is a unique State involvement as the legislation deals with the constitutional balance between the Commonwealth and the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Nobody could logically argue that in a matter which affects the powers of the States under the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the full views of the States ought not to be known by this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* However, we would argue, and the House also should be reminded, that unless the legal and constitutional co-operation which is inherent in this proposal is matched by a financial partnership between the Commonwealth and the States, the objective of co-operative federalism of which the Prime Minister spoke in his second reading speech will not be achieved.

* It has occurred to members of the Opposition and to others that in the event of this amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> being carried at a referendum there could be read into this provision a possibility that, for example, the provisions of section 92 or section 99 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> would cease to have the force and effect which they presently have.

* The history of the Australian Federation during the past 10 years has been one of a gradual transfer of power from the States to the Federal Government, yet during that period of time that transfer of power has on no occasion been facilitated by an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, except in respect of the referendum to give the Commonwealth power over Aboriginal affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The nearest we have come to recognising formally a need to give additional constitutional sanction to power sharing between governments has been through the Commonwealth-State Financial Agreement and the subsequent inclusion of section 105a in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Whatever might be done in reordering and restructuring the division of power between the national government and the States, in my opinion it would be wrong to leave open still the question of recognising in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the need for giving formal constitutional authority to the interchange of powers between the Federal government and the States.

* As Professor Geoffrey Sawer has said so cogently, beyond any doubt constitutionally Australia is a frozen continent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* As a consequence, we have been obliged to get around the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in many ways, and this has become the name of the game. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* If the experience of the past 75 years is any guide at all, the continuing change in our social, economic and political life can make a constitutional provision, previously thought to be inviolable, not only obsolete but also detrimental to the workings of good government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* In Australia in the twentieth century we have already witnessed how many changes have made parts of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> quite unfitted for dealing with many aspects of our life- in the fields of trade, commerce, corporations and industry.

* The result has been that whatever the economic and social realities have been at a particular time, in terms of the allocation of constitutional powers, change can and may soon make them outmoded. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* A very great risk to our society, arising out of the inability of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to move with the times, is that the nature of change and the speed of change may be such that all governments in our system may lose control of evolving situations unless our constitutional mechanisms have the adaptability and flexibility to meet them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* However, section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>- the referendum provision- has proved that this device has failed to meet the need to update our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* As the honourable member for Bennelong said, certainly the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> has been amended but, with a few notable exceptions, largely as a result of judicial interpretation by the High Court rather than at the ballot box. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Let me wrap this up by indicating that I firmly believe that section 128 must be the most serious issue facing this country and is without question the major stumbling block in constitutional change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* What is needed is for the intergovernmental arrangements to be given suitable recognition in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to enable interchanges of constitutional authority to be achieved without the trauma of referenda or backdoor dealings between the Federal Government and the State governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* So there was mutuality between the Commonwealth and the States for a refurbishing of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to put powers in the appropriate parliaments where they would be exercised better. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The Bill proposes to insert in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> 2 new sections, section 108a and section 108b. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Proposed new section 108a (1) is quite clear as to what it means on its wording, but 108a (2) would present a great deal of problems to some people who are concerned that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is not changed from its basic federal concept to render it a more centralist constitutional document. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The power of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to designate a matter under this section is not limited by the provisions of this <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> other than this section. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* That will raise great fears on the part of many people that the Bill is proposing to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> quite dramatically by allowing the Commonwealth to pick up a piece of power, which it now does not have, and give it to the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The second thing is that I believe, on the meaning of the words, that the Commonwealth cannot designate more power than the remainder of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself in fact gives to it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The three of those need a great deal of examination before we will satisfy people's minds that they can readily and properly vote in a referendum for this change to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Finally, I draw attention to section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which is the section which deals with referendum changes to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Those of us who have taken an interest in the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> over recent years, I believe, have come to the point of view that there is a great need for reform, and the referendums which have been put to the Australian people recently are an example of the desire of this Government to effect reforms to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* If honourable members study the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Act they will see that in the initial stages it was not necessarily intended that Western Australia should become a member of the Federation in the first instance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* So we find inherent in our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provisions which would not be included in a <span class="highlight">constitution</span> which was written today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* However, we all realise the great difficulty in changing specific provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to allow for the need for change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Inter-change of Powers) Bill is one way in which we can overcome some of these difficulties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* These constitutional problems would, I believe, be largely overcome if this referendum is carried and the States can refer powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* We need something written into our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to enable a formalization of any agreements which may be arrived at in cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It can be said that some of the points that he made emphasise one of the difficulties and one of the problems of constitutional referenda. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Perhaps there is a fear in the minds of many people when it comes to changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* That is why, as already mentioned on 2 occasions by the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)  and the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie),  there is a difficulty in having constitutional alterations passed and in fact in having any referenda passed by the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I was interested in the remarks of the Prime Minister when he mentioned that the reference of powers by the States to the Australian Parliament is already allowed for in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The proposed <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> alteration before the House will remedy this position by making it quite clear that a reference given by the States will be revocable, that it may be given subject to conditions, including conditions regulating the kinds of laws that may be passed in pursuance of it, and may be made for a limited period of time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* That brings me to the point that there is a great deal of value in this legislation which is being presented for the alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by the insertion of proposed new sections 108a and 108b. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* So, it is for that reason that, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Bennelong, we in the Opposition support the constitutional proposals involved in the change which the legislation presented by the Prime Minister seeks to achieve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Jacobi) in a speech that was equally as wide ranging as that of the honourable member for Lyne drew attention to the remarks attributed to Professor Sawer of the Australian National University in which he described the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as perhaps a frozen <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It was the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)  who said that our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is not only 75 years old but really finds its roots or its basis in an earlier period. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* There are really only 3 instruments of change provided for or built into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* One is the system of referenda referred to in section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It is a notorious factperhaps 'notorious' is the wrong word, but it is certainly a fact- that Labor Party governments want to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by referenda. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The second method of change which the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides is to be found in section 51 placitum (xxxvii) which enables referrals of power by the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* This measure seeks to overcome that situation by changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to permit the States to have returned the power that they have referred if they want it back and to attach conditions if they wish to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I refer to the fact that the other systems of change have so dismally failed that the High Court which interprets the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and which I heard the Chief Justice say the other day was actually an arm of government that is something with which I might not necessarily agree- has turned out to be the instrument of change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* It is to overcome the rigidity or inflexibility which is such a feature of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and which results in our country being described by prominent academics as the frozen land that this change is put forward on this occasion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I agree with one of the earlier speakers who said that if this can be brought about it will be one of the most momentous changes for good in the future- I am not talking about next week or in 6 months time, I am talking of 10 years, 20 years, 50 years or 100 years- that will have been brought about in the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, because it will introduce an element of flexibility which, at the moment, is completely lacking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* When one looks at sub-section (2) of proposed new section 108a I suppose the principal point I can put to him is, as he appreciates, that it provides that the power of the Australian Parliament to designate a matter is not limited by the general provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* One might find support for the proposition from some other part of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> but that might be a matter where a reference of power might help overcome the problem in the way in which sub-section (2) of proposed new section 108a contemplates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The situation we come back to is that sub-section (3) of proposed new section 108a makes it clear that provisions like section 92 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> -are applicable to State laws made under a designation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I conclude with these final words: I am not sure whether the germ of this idea of a mutual exchange of powers can be traced back to the 1957 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review of this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* I know that the Prime Minister has been very much attached to the idea of constitutional change for a great period of time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* The initiative in bringing this measure forward is largely a tribute to the Prime Minister's persistent interest in constitutional reform and constitutional change and a recognition that this frozen, rigid <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of ours must somehow in 1975, and in 1985 and in 1995, be made capable of adapting itself to the changing world that it is intended to serve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0)

* Further, for the Attorney-General to threaten to treat a referral of this Bill to a select committee of both Houses or to a Senate committee as a failure to pass within the terms of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is to treat an important social service, legal aid, as a simple tactical political tool. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* Firstly- I invite honourable gentlemen opposite to examine this- there must be serious doubts as to the constitutionality of the functions conferred by the Bill on the Australian Legal Aid Office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* Certainly the incidental power under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> would be some help in providing a constitutional basis base for the provisions of clause 6 of the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* Obviously there is no power in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to legislate with respect to legal aid as a subject matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0)

* There is no head of power under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> entitling the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws generally with respect to legal aid, but it may be supposed that it can legislate to provide legal aid as an incident to the enforcement of rights under legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament- for example, under the Bankruptcy Act or under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* As it is, the federal legal aid program proposed in this BUI will be limited <span class="highlight">constitution</span>.ally to all matters arising under federal law and to people to whom the Federal Parliament has a special responsibility, such as Aborigines, students, migrants and pensioners.

* So you can see,  Mr Chairman,  how the situation has seriously and rapidly deteriorated in recent years, because in 1974 when the Labor Government was in office and it put its Supply legislation before the Senate, as it is obliged to do pursuant to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>,  Senator Withers  said in the Senate: 'I do not intend to deal with this matter until such time as you, the House of Representatives, submit yourself to an election '.

* In the course of looking at the legalities of the situation it is interesting to look at how our own High Court, in dealing with cases which I think related more to Papua New Guinea, has been in a bit of a dilemma in the past as to whether its powers were virtually under section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> or what is known as the external affairs power, which is placitum (xxix) of section 51.

* The Committee considered that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself should provide that High Court justices be required to retire on reaching the age of 70 years and that Parliament should be empowered to fix the maximum retirement ages of other Federal judges subject to a constitutional limit of 70 years.

* It is essential that the Australian people accept that there are legitimate occasions when they should be entitled to cast their views on suggested change, particularly change to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which written as it is prescribes so much of the terms and conditions within which our Federal Government can operate.

* These 4 questions emerged not just as a product of a decision by this Government, not because two of them have been before the people before, but because the Australian Constitutional Convention on three successive occasions led towards an acceptance of these 4 resolutions, which was achieved finally at the Wrest Point convention.

* In that sense there needs to be a recognition by those who might question these referenda that throughout the country there seems to be a universal accord that this type of deliberation on the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is worth while; that if there is to be constitutional change it should not be just for the fulfilment of the political aspirations, desires or objectives of the Government for the time being in Canberra but it should be something that has evolved from the consultation at the Constitutional Conventions.

* The second question which I think is equally likely to be accepted without criticism, although I know that there were some people at the Constitutional Convention in Hobart who offered some views upon it, is the question of altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so as to allow electors in Territories as well as electors in the States to vote at referendums on proposed laws to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* However, it also needs to be recognised that when last submitted there was another condition added, and that was that the present requirement, to which reference was made in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, that there be not only a majority of electors but also a majority of electors in a majority of States before the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> be changed, would also be modified.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* In 1974 the Australian Labor Party Government submitted that question along with 3 others- the mode of altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to which I referred a moment ago, democratic elections and local government questionsto the people at the same time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* I think it important that in looking at the package as it was then submitted- the precipitate way in which it emerged before consideration by the Convention, without the ratification or the backing of the Convention- we realise the questions were put as matters which it was felt by us and, I suspect, by many Australians, for the vote indicated that that was so, were designed to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to the advantage of the then Government.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0)

* I believe it is necessary when filling casual vacancies that we recognise that there will be a prescribed procedure which will enable the State governments to determine the manner by which they will select persons to fill casual vacancies, and which will ensure that the rights of the States are preserved, as it shall be certified by the Governor of the State and not by the GovernorGeneral, and that Governor of the State will then be able to submit the name and the person will be appointed in accordance with a constitutional requirement which I believe will validly set out a fit and proper procedure.

* For an individual or a small group of people to use as they did, the powers conferred by section 15 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as a means of distorting the balance of political power in the Senate is to debase our political system and to bring that system into utter contempt.

* In respect of the filling of vacancies, the Government is acting in the way it is now acting for the sole purpose of trying to prevent the election of  Senator Brown  at the next half Senate election because, as the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> now stands, it would be necessary for Victoria to elect 6 senators instead of five. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32)

* This proposal means that the Government will be able effectively to prevent the Labor Party from having other than an outside chance of winning a third seat in Victoria because it will alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so that the  Senator who  was appointed by the Victorian Parliament to fill the vacancy caused by the death of  Senator Greenwood  will now continue to hold office until the expiration of the normal term for which  Senator Greenwood  would have been entitled to hold office.

* In the first of the two recently decided cases, Western Australia against the Commonwealth- it is known as McKinlay's case and was decided in December in 1975- the High Court held that section 24 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> intended the calculations used for ascertaining the number of members must be made before each general election and therefore held that this required the latest statistics of the Commonwealth to be used. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* He held that section 24 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> required the implementation of the principle of one vote one value, as nearly as practicable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* Secondly, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides for an original State to have a certain number of members and thereby the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> denies electoral justice.

* That decision has made it quite clear that there is a need to amend the existing relevant legislation in order to bring it into accord with the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as it was interpreted in the 2 High Court decisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0)

* For instance, although the High Court said that it was enough just to rely on section 24 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, there is a need to do something about section 10 of the Representation Act and the amending legislation in fact does that.

* Nothing is dictated by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in relation to this but, at the same time, by the time an election is held after a redistribution it may well be found that the precise numbers upon which electorates have been divided up have changed because of population changes.

* Thus, the fact that under the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the High Court may be asked to determine the constitutional validity of legislation passed by Parliament does not mean that the High Court will be usurping the role of Parliament or that Parliament is less independent or separated from the judiciary.
