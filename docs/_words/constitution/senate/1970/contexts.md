* The critical point, as  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson says, is the words 'in session', lt is very useful to refer to what the learned authors of 'The Annotated <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the Australian Commonwealth -  Sir John  Quick and  Sir Robert  Garran - had to say about this matter when they wrote this work after the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was established. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0)

* Until  the  receipt of the statutory notification, that cannot be dune; hence a delay in the notification would delay a choice by me Stale legislature or an appointment by the State Executive lo fill the place until the election of a successor, lt is a principle of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> thai the representation of States in the Senate should be maintained, as far as possible, wilh unbroken continuity, and that no  State  should be, for any time longer than absolutely necessary, short in ils representation and consequently deficient in ils political strength in  the  Council of Stales.

* I have to the best of my abilities researched the Convention debates, lt seems to me that the intention of the founders of this <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was much as the authors Quick and Garran have indicated, that is, ro ensure that vacancies when notified should be filled as soon as possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0)

* Bui it would appear that the words "in recess' derived not from Westminster traditions but rather from the practice of the United Stales <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which has a comparable provision which says that vacancies may be filled by a governor when the legislature of a State is in recess.

* Notwithstanding what conclusions may be drawn from reading (he history of the section, the fact is that we now have an expression in our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which apparently is being relied upon by the Government of New South Wales to avoid - I think the word 'avoid' is appropriate in all the circumstances - the filling of a vacancy of that State in this Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0)

* So, if the words 'in session' are meant to apply to the commencement of a session until a prorogation some many months later irrespective of the number of sittings, the action of the Western Australian Government would not be consistent with that interpretation of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* It was well recognised by the High Court in 1907 that the Governor of a State carrying out functions such as those which are conferred upon him by section 15 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, acts as the constitutional head of the State and can act on the advice of his Ministers.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0)

* The alternative view is to ensure that the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> are observed by proroguing a Parliament which is simply achieved by proclamation and a constitutional situation, if this be the interpretation which is relied upon, will then operate, lt should be noted that by a curious coincidence of events the current session of the New South Wales Parliament is a session which apparently began in August of last year ami is still continuing.

* If the mere airing of this does not carry its own weight then I would hope in due course that the Senate, as a Senate, without regard to Party positions would regard this as an appropriate occasion to ensure by methods which it has at its disposal that this aspect of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is preserved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0)

* J entirely agree with what he has said, lt seems to me that New South Wales could have taken the course, even on the interpretation which it has undoubtedly proceeded upon under section 15 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, of either calling together the Houses of Parliament and proceeding to the election of a senator to fill the vacancy or of proroguing the Parliament and achieving the same result, at least until the meeting of Parliament as a result of action by the Executive Council, lt is extremely disturbing that the State can be deprived of its representation in this way.

* But I take it that we would have the same obligation in this country, where we have a written <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, similar to thai in the Dicey Conventions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in England, and that even if the State governments are not required by law or by their ministerial advisers to do this or that, there is nevertheless a convention that they will do it.

* In the light of what this Government is attempting, I draw attention again today to this gap in our legal code which does not spell out similarly the sorts of rights which exist under the American <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and the sorts of precautions against this arbitrary tyrannical conduct which is possible from a government - fortunately a rare occurrence in this country - which is as insensitive to the rule of law as is this Government which boasts so constantly to be the upholder of the rule of law.

* It is this: Because of the tremendous powers under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the Senate, and because it has the total power of veto of the lower House - it has been said that the Senate is the most powerful second chamber in the world - an increase in the membership of the House of Representatives without an increase in the membership of the Senate would result in an increasing concentration of power, particularly the power of veto, in a House whose numbers were diminishing relative to those of the people's House.

* The constitutional convention which is contemplated at the instance of the States, in which the Commonwealth will participate and about which a steering committee has met already to plan the mode of approach for a review of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, undoubtedly will take into its ambit of consideration this vexed question of Commonwealth and State financial relations, and it is certainly time that that was done.

* We can only hope that that will be one of the early matters considered by the constitutional convention because we must always remember that under the present concept of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the States are substantially the developing and construction authorities, that the Commonwealth has complete control over the major resources of revenue, and that the reconciliation of those 2 things can be accompanied only by the development and the projection of a proper financial formula.

* Even if the Senate debated this Bill for the next day or two with the greatest of haste, and by so doing it would fail to discharge its duty under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and its Standing Orders by deserting its full responsibilities, this power could not be granted to the Government until December.

* In short we have provided for the Government the opportunity on which, if it chooses to avail itself of the provisions of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, it may go to the Governor-General and ask for a double dissolution and thereby put its record to the judgment of the Australian people.

* The motion seeks to suspend the standing order which otherwise would require the lapse of 2 1 days between the passing of the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Prices) Bill, which is about to be debated, and the putting of the motion for the third reading of the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* It has to be suspended because the consideration which one would suppose a constitutional alteration requires has not been given to this proposal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* It has been thoughtfully put into the Standing Orders because of the unique role that the Senate plays in all constitutional amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* It provides that before the third reading of any Bill by which an alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is proposed there shall be a call of the Senate, which requires 2 1 days notice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* This was put in for the purpose of requiring thoughtful processes to go into the preparation of constitutional amendments, just as the founding fathers in section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> required that a Bill for the amendment of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, once passed its third reading stage, should not be impulsively and promptly pumped out to the public for debate tomorrow. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* As we know section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> requires that there shall be a delay of at least 2 months so that a proper campaign and proper debate can take place in the country on the matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* If the 2 proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to give the Government control over prices and incomes are passed at the referendum to be held later this year, will he assure the House that his Government will use both powers and not just the power over prices?

* Very often we cannot tell whether a referendum will go through because there is a caution in the minds of the Australian people when it comes to fiddling around with the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which was given such a great deal of thought when it was first created. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* But the hard cold fact is that when the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was written the writers of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provided- and it was agreed to by this Parliament- that it would be very difficult to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* Because of that, and also because of the efficiency of those who drew up the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, there have been very few alterations to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> since 1 90 1 . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> laid down that there would be 2 Houses of Parliament- a bicameral system of government- and if the bicameral system of government means anything, in my view it means 2 principal things. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* In other words, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, by providing for 2 Houses of Parliament, ensured that the voice of public opinion could be heard by the parliamentarians, the Government and principally the senators sitting in the Upper House, and this has happened so far. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> also provides that Parliament should draw up its Standing Orders, and the Standing Orders of the Parliament provides the further safeguard that the rights of the people shall be upheld and that the people, if they so desire, shall be able to make their voices heard before the Parliament takes any action in respect of which the people want to express their opinion to the parliamentarians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* So in drawing up the Standing Orders the Parliament has made it more difficult to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by including standing order 242 which this debate is all about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* So the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, our Standing Orders and our system of government have provided for a delay so that the people can make their opinions heard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* The Government introduced the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Prices) Bill for a referendum to be put to the people exclusively on the question of prices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* The impression has been created here that if a stand had been taken against the Government's Bill, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Prices) Bill, the referendum would not have taken place and that any conferring of powers on the Commonwealth Government could not have taken place because no referendum Bill would have been carried. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* In response to what has been put by  Senator Greenwood  I say that it seems reasonable for the short title of a- Bill which seeks to insert in section 5 1 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the word 'prices' to be '.Constitutional Alteration (Prices) 1973'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54)

* The meaning of the word prices', if it comes into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by reason of the decision of the people following the vote of the Senate today, will be a matter in the ultimate for determination by the High Court of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54)

* It is no use anyone suggesting that we in this chamber can lay down with precision the limits to the meaning of the word 'prices', the word 'banking', the word 'insurance', or the other words which are set out in the legislative powers conferred on this Parliament by section 5 1 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* It was the view of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, which was set up by this Parliament, that an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> ought to be made to cover television.

* What is being given is what has been given before- and in the wisdom of those who drew up the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and of those who drew up other constitutions, these legislative powers were always given in the broad and general way which is proposed by this measure.

* Precise definition was more difficult then, but here we are now with one specific word proposed by the Government to be inserted into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and it is the obligation of the Government, which will have the responsibility if this referendum is passed, to initiate legislation under this power to explain. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54)

* Looking at section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> it appears that if the Senate rejects or amends a Bill and returns it to the House of Representatives and this action proves to be unsatisfactory to that House then in 3 months time the House of Representatives can resubmit the Bill.

* The purpose of this Bill- and this is its only purpose- is to provide a measure of representation for the Australian Capital Territory and for the Northern Territory in the Senate and thus give some meaningful expression to section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in respect of the Senate as an integral part of this Parliament.

* The Government's legal advice is that Section 24 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> does not have application in relation to senators who may be provided for a Territory under the provisions of section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0)

* In other words, the requirement contained in section 24 for the number of members of the House of Representatives to be as nearly as practicable twice the number of senators does not relate to Territory members or senators provided under section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The people responsible for drafting the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> acted very wisely in this respect as this principle gave a reasonable guarantee to the 3 smaller States that they would have an equal voice in the Senate and provided a balance to the House of Representatives where they were decidedly outnumbered by New South Wales and Victoria.

* The aim of the proposed amendment to the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> which will be submitted to a referendum at the time of the next Senate election is to make funds available direct to the local government, both by way of grants and by loans at lower interest rates, so that urban and rural councils and other local government bodies can be freed from the straitened circumstances of the past.

* They are there because the Government in its wisdom wanted to hear the whole of the people from that part of the educational spectrum but it did not want to have its choice limited to the nominations of the Episcopal Conference, quite apart from any constitutional difficulties which might arise under section 1 16 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* What the Opposition has in mind is to comprehend a number of what we believe have been strongly held views of a variety of people, including even the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  as expressed in past statements and actions, of the Labor Party in its approved policy speech, and of a number of organisations throughout Australia which are interested in education, and basically supported by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44)

* In a local area like the Australian Capital Territory that may be the appropriate method, but the very fact that at the grass roots there are organisations charged with administering local educational needs constitutes a very good reason why that sort of <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the overriding body- the Schools Commission- should not be done in the same way.

* -Well, I think that is a way of expressing what we all know is the position: That by reason of the provisions of section 109, of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> any valid law passed by this Parliament operates to cut across any laws of the State Parliament.

* The need to change the emphasis by amending section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> has been felt for years; but like so much else, including the second proposal I will put in a moment, nothing- I say nothing- was done by our predecessors in office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* By the new proposal, it will still be possible to obtain an amendment of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> only if a majority of all the electors voting agree, but instead of requiring a majority of the States- which at present means 4 out of the 6 States, and thus a two-thirds majority- what we are proposing is that a majority of voters in not less than half of the States will be necessary, as well as an overall majority of voters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0)

* But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original 6 States, means in the elegant words of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Review Committee that 'for every State in which there is an adverse vote there must be a favourable vote in two states ... a Constitutional change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States.

* At the same time, in case any have a sense that this change will make amendment of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> too easy, let me remind honourable senators that had the original <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> requirement been for no less than one-half of the States, as we now propose, only two more of the 26 proposals put to the people would have been approved.

* I am looking forward to the results of the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention so that as Australia moves into the next 30 years we can have a completely new distribution of power, so that the States no longer will feel themselves to be mendicants at the table of the Commonwealth and so that the Commonwealth will know at any time in view of its new international responsibilities just where it is going, where its areas of power, clearly and undisputably will lie and the States will have not only the responsibility for certain things but will have the means at their disposal without having to resort to alternative sources of finance by way of annual agreements or special approaches to finance their duties within the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The mere recital of the short titles of the 4 Bills- the first concerns simultaneous elections, the second concerns so-called democratic elections, the third concerns local government bodies and the fourth concerns the mode of altering the Constitutionwould indicate to anybody with the slightest acquaintance with the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the variety of considerations that these Bills will evoke in debate as to whether they are appropriate matters to be put to a referendum. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-60)

* It was considered desirable that, when an alteration to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was thought necessary and a Bill proposing the alteration was required to be passed by the Houses of Parliament, there should be a 3-week delay for a call of honourable senators so that the issue could be properly debated before it was submitted to the people.

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> makes clear that there must be an absolute majority of the Senate to pass any of the referendum proposals unless it is by way of the subsequent provisions which the Senate rejects or fails to pass.

 - Mr President, the matter before the Senate at the moment is a Bill for an Act to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so as to ensure that the Senate elections are held at the same time as the House of Representatives elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* Once upon a time, of course, the long title of a Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> set out what the referendum proposal was to be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* Firstly, we can have simultaneous elections at any time that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  likes to go and see the Governor-General because in section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> there is provision for a double dissolution if there is a disagreement between the 2 Houses. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* We are told that the main provisions of the Bill are for a new section in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> giving senators a term equal to 2 terms in the House of Representatives, and for simultaneous elections of both Houses. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* The great strength and the great value of the Senate is its independence, and the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, as it now stands, gives it that independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* The Senate at that time remembered that it was constituted by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in a different fashion from the House of Representatives for the very purpose of having a different approach on proper matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* As  Senator Withers  said in the course of his speech this afternoon, unless there had been a different approach and a different <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the Senate there would never have been any Federation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* The second point I wish to make about the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the Senate is that honourable senators are elected for a term of 6 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* That, in the minds of the thoughtful framers of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, would give, and it has given to this place, a stability that is not available under the Westminster system to the House responsive to the responsible Government down below. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* Since the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of our select and standing committees the Senate has had a great impact upon policy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* So I just pause for a little silent pity towards the author of this proposal; and the more so when I reflect on how he has masqueraded as a constitutional constructor. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* I do not think it is a very good move at all to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to enable this place to be taken to an election every time the House of Representatives decides to go to an election. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* That is not how the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> ought to be altered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* If the proposal is not put to the people immediately because the Senate declines to do so and accepts the proposal to refer the matter to a committee, the Government will treat this course as a failure to pass in terms of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and will, at the earliest opportunity, bring forward the proposal again in such a way that the provisions of section 128 can be availed of, and it can be put to the people without the concurrence of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* If one House declines to pass a referendum Bill which has been passed by the other House, after the constitutional interval the matter can be put directly to the people so that this kind of obstruction cannot prevail. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* The interposition of a committee between the alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and the people ought not to be supported. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* Therefore, it appeared to the Government that the convenient way of synchronising elections of the 2 Houses was to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so that when there was an election for the House of Representatives there was one for the Senate also. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61)

* I know that this has been the subject of a division of opinion, but I would like to know, from the Attorney-General, for the purpose of considering the Bill at the appropriate stage what is the view of the Government on whether an alteration to this effect would be valid in any State where a majority of voters were against this proposed law which enables the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in relation to that State to be altered by a 3-State majority instead of a 4-State majority.

* The provision of continuing religious indoctrination which is undoubtedly prized by Catholics and which is their main justification for the perpetuation of their separate school system, is a matter to be entrusted to their own religious orders, and should not, in fact, probably cannot under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> be a matter with which the Commonwealth Government can concern itself.

* I say to  Senator Drake-Brockman  that the Australian Government is paying the money under section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in order to help the States to implement their own plans, and there is no centralised control from Canberra, which is the phrase used by him.

* Although I have heard the indications that the Bill will be dealt with expeditiously early next session, all I can say is that at this stage the Government will regard the failure by the Opposition to deal with the Bill now as a failure to pass it within the meaning of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* More particularly, in view of the Constitutional Convention which has been convened, which has sat already and is continuing its deliberations, it would be inappropriate if the constitutional relations of the Commonwealth were allowed to be redetermined and redefined, as no doubt they will be in some areas if the recommendations of that Convention are adopted, and it would be inappropriate if at the same time the diversity of law were allowed to continue without interruption and the systems were allowed to continue to develop in their own way.

* So, if a person has a mining title under the State law but the minerals are in the ground it would seem quite feasible, under this Bill, for the Petroleum Authority to go in and take over the mine, and it is doubtful whether any compensation would be payable except insofar as the owners would be protected by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* This process is surrounded by all the circumscriptions and all the defences that it should have, because the amending of the Constitutionof the written document, the contract and compact of Federation- is a sacred arrangement and not likely to be disturbed and certainly not likely to be disturbed by a government electing through control in one House to by-pass the complete legislative process by compelling legislation through the Upper House and then saying to the people that the decision is theirs.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44)

* I suppose you will try to delay it or in some way try to cover up the fact that you want to deny the people of Australia a vote on the proposition so that in their wisdom or unwisdom, whatever it may be, they can decide how they want to shape their <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* I would suggest that it is not a very good day for democracy when the Opposition parties, after having so decisively rejected this measure, which was simply a measure to put the proposition to the people, now, again, in March- when the Government is proceeding as expeditiously as it can to fulfil the constitutional requirements- are pretending that they need time to make up their minds or to debate the issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides that such a proposal, if put through the House of Representatives again after 3 months and again rejected by the Senate, or if the Senate fails to pass it, can be put to the people even if the Senate has tried to prevent its being put to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0)

* It intends to refuse, if it can, to let the people have a vote but it is not going to succeed because the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides for the people to have a say even though there is a majority of senators here who try to prevent their having a say in the alteration of their own <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* He has come into the Senate as Leader of the Government in the Senate with a request from the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that he bulldoze through the Senate tonight a series of <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> alteration Bills, debate on which was gagged in another place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0)

* It has been part of our responsibility to see that governments, whatever their political complexion, made up of majority parties do not become arrogant in the application of the power that is unquestionably and rightfully theirs to the point that they exercise that power unwisely, not in accordance with the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> or against the interests of the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0)

* Whilst it is true that, under the rules laid down in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, in a referendum the people will express their point of view, I must point out that until that stage is reached we, the senators in this place and the members in another place, are the people who express their point of view. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0)

* The Government has come back and said that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> nevertheless provides that if the House of Representatives passes such a measure for the second time after an interval of 3 months and this place rejects or fails to pass it the people can have their say. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0)

* And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, 'God Save The Queen', are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of Justice.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46)

* It has been suggested that in some way the Senate, in taking the stand that it is taking, is intruding unduly, almost without authority and certainly quite indefensibly in the progress of a <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration Bill.

* Judging from the history of this country, I do not think that the putting of a question to the Australian people by way of a referendum should excite the government of the day very greatly because so often people who go forward with great enthusiasm for the questions being put find that the Australian people are very hard to move when it comes to changing the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The Senate has powers under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which make it an equal House of Parliament with the House of Representatives, and as far as we are concerned the Senate is not going to be a spongy rubber stamp.

* The Bill has very long term implications for the Senate and for the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as such because it deals with something which will be written into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which will be permanent and which will remain, if carried by a majority of electors in a majority of the States until, if thought necessary, another referendum is held to change it.

* Firstly, we can have simultaneous elections at any time that the Prime Minister likes to go to the GovernorGeneral because section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> contains a provision for a double dissolution if there is a disagreement between the 2 houses.

* Senator Murphy  says that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill is another of the Bills which the Senate should press through immediately. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* Yet, that speech, and that is the Labor Party case to the people to which I referred, gave no hint of Labor's plans to launch, with unprecedented intensity, an attack on the very cornerstone of democracy, namely, the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* This Bill that we are debating proposes that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> be altered to ensure that, in future, elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate will be held at the same time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* This proposal is that in all cases hereafter when the House of Representatives goes to the people for election there should be held a Senate election simultaneously, irrespective of the circumstances that have brought on the election and irrespective of the essential elements of the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is for that very reason and to safeguard stability, responsibility and faithfulness to the people in some measure, that a <span class="highlight">constitution</span> has been framed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* We know that this country would never have unified to the state of nationhood that it has attained under the form of a federal <span class="highlight">constitution</span> unless a common basis had been found to enable the 6 colonies at the time to agree upon a <span class="highlight">constitution</span> to establish this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* So the assumption grew that elections should be held at the same time if possible, but there were cardinal considerations with regard to the Senate that made that assumption quite unreal and quite subversive to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* This Bill is not in order from the point of view of ordinary constitutional processes, because the people who accepted the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in 1900 laid down with great particularity and emphasis the means whereby the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> should be amended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* If one examines how the founding fathers put the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> together, it will be noted that they saw that the concentration of power in one man or in one group was bad. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* When the founding fathers wrote the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> they made 2 quite significant points. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* Section 7 of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> states in an unqualified way: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* However, section 28 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* Basically, they wrote into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the idea of the need for continuity in the Senate over a period of 6 years, recognising that in the popular or lower House there could be convulsion, that the term of office might be shortened, that a Prime Minister might well choose to hold an election for the House of Representatives before the 3 years laid down in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> had expired. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* They then put 2 methods into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which are available to a Government of the day if it wants to rectify these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* If the Government of the day, under the existing <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, wants to bring elections for the 2 Houses into line it can do so now without seeking any more power at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* But under the present <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> it is competent for a government at any time to bring elections for the 2 Houses into conjunction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* The power lies, at this moment, within the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* But if the Commonwealth Government wants to go further, it has specific power under section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to seek a double dissolution and to bring out simultaneously the whole of the lower House and the whole 60 senators in a joint dissolution of the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* We would not be having a Senate election in 2 months time if the power sought in this Bill were now written into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* The people of Australia should understand that those who are talking today of reforming the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> with regard to the Senate are pledged to the abolition of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* Under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the Senate stands as a brake upon such an obsession. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* I think it is well for us to remember that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is not wrapped around the House of Representatives, it is wrapped around the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* Under those circumstances 1 cannot see the great fuss and stampede of the Prime Minister and others in wanting to bring in this change to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so that we will have simultaneous elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* Looking at the whole situation from the Australian point of view, from the parliamentary system and from the Senate's aspect, I feel that the proposed amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is one which we should not support. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* I hope that if this proposal to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> goes before the people they will reply to it in similar vein to the case in which I think I played some part when the people rejected a recommendation of the previous Government when it wanted to break the nexus between the Houses, which would have affected the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* Whether the people want to vote for or against the proposals, the Government said to them: 'We undertake as part of the program upon which we ask you to vote for us that we will put to you certain proposals so that you may decide whether you want to alter your <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* This was acceded to following the acknowledgement of the Leader of the Opposition that the several <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> alteration Bills must be dealt with before the Senate rose. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* It was resolved, contrary to the clear wishes of the Government as expressed by me, that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report to the Senate as soon as possible but not later than the first sitting day after 1 February 1974. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* I then stated specifically that if the proposal was not put to the people immediately, because the Senate declined to do so and accepted the proposal to refer the matter to the Committee, the Government would treat this course as a failure to pass in terms of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and would at the earliest opportunity bring it forward again in such a way that the provisions of section 128 could be availed of and the proposed law put to the people without the concurrence of the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* In my opinion the Senate's action in sending the proposed law to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on 4 December 1973, particularly when construed in the light of the failure of the Committee to meet to consider the matter, constituted a failure to pass the proposed law within the meaning of section 128 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* It may not be necessary to advance this argument but I think it should be understood that there is a theme which runs through the speeches of members of the Opposition, that is, that the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in regard to referenda as well as dissolutions upon deadlock somehow postulate some breach of duty by the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0)

* 1 believe that there is a heavy public demand for it, but irrespective of whether that is right the Government's proposal is merely to let the people say how they want their own <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to operate.

* This <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill is the second of these infamous referendum Bills which the Government is proposing before the Senate and on which I express the viewpoint of the Opposition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* Secondly, irrespective of what happens in this chamber, whether the proposal is carried or lost- and the Prime Minister has made this point abundantly clear- the Prime Minister may go to the GovernorGeneral and, under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, he may ask the Governor-General to put this proposition to the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* It is a Bill proposing a referendum which is that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> be amended in 2 respects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* We are concerned at the moment with a Bill which seeks to give authority to place before the people of Australia a question suggesting that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> should be amended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* On every occasion on which the Senate has dealt with matters relating to referenda we have had conjured up in this House by the wild thinking of Opposition senators bogus suggestions of all sorts of dire consequences to the people of Australia if the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is amended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0)

* In other words, under section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the Federal Government, when it makes a grant, has not only the power to say what money will be allocated but also how that money will be spent.

* If the Government is genuine when it says that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> needs to be altered- as one Government senator said the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is 73 years old and it needs to be brought up to date- we do not disagree with that.

* It has lumped these 2 proposals together either because it does not really want those living in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to be given a vote on proposals to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, or because it is hoping to float through its proposals to simplify altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> on a wave of sympathy for the electors in the Territories.

* If we are to accept the argument put yesterday by the Government senators that we would be acting undemocratically in not allowing the proposal to go to the people then I ask this quesiton and I would like to hear the comments of Government senators on this proposition when they reply: If a Bill which would submit a proposal for an alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to the people should pass through the Senate with a constitutional majority of 31 votes, go to the House of Representatives, and be rejected and then, after an interval of 3 months, again be passed by the Senate with a Constitutional majority of 3 1 votes, would the Government give an absolute undertaking that it would advise the Governor-General to submit that proposal to the people?

* -The Bill before the chamber is perhaps different from the other proposed referendum Bills because while they deal with specific heads of power this Bill relates to the actual machinery of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself and to the mode of altering the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* Insofar as the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is a solemn compact, a solemn contract, in which the States have this most important role, it seems to me to be basic logic that if that instrument is to be subject  to  change and if the States are to have a continuance of their primary significance there must be an overwhelming vote by the States as such for or against any alteration to the compact of federation, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* It is on that basis that I appeal to honourable senators to give their consideration seriously to this Bill and to see whether there is any element of prudence or wisdom at all or whether there is not such a fundamental change being effected in the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by this means that the original concept of federation will be lost and destroyed completely. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* We support that concept which would give all Territorians the right to vote on propositions altering the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> because, after all, variations in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> are matters of great concern to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* We say that if you are going to disturb the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, if it is a document which is so important in determining the relationships between the Commonwealth and the States and the States inter se, it should only be done by a majority of the States indicating in a clear and decisive manner their preparedness to have that variation made.

* I find it inconceivable that a person who believes in the right of a majority of the people and a majority of the States to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>- that is what he says is the proper and desirable position- would oppose the Government putting to precisely that body the proposed alteration so that, if in their wisdom a majority of the people and a majority of the States decided to alter their <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so that in future changes could be made by a majority of the people and half the States, they would be able to do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* If the compact is that the alteration can be made by a majority of the States together with a majority of the people and the majority decides to change what the honourable senator calls the compact, how can anyone possibly resist it if those who have the wisdom and so on and those who are given the power by the Commonwealth decide deliberately to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>?

* As I said on another occasion, there is no provision in our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> for amendments to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to be initiated by motion of the people at large, by petition, by resolution or by any approach at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* In other words, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> contemplates that a proposition, whether propounded by the government of the day, or, as is also contemplated in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, by the House of Representatives or this chamber, should go through the legislative process as an examination of the desirability of putting that proposition to the people.

* This question has been discussed before in the Senate and the Senate ruled twice that the Standing Orders had to give way to the provision in section 23 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which states: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1)

* In a sense you would be saying that if you took the constitutional provision set out in section 23 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and applied it, the question would be carried because there was the simple majority.

* If an alternative view were taken, that standing order 242 was invalid as being substantially in conflict with the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, one would have to say that the measure had been passed, and then send it back.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1)

* But then we come to standing order 242.I submit that the only construction that you can give to that, if you adhere to prevailing rulings as to the reconciliation between section 23 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and the standing order which requires an absolute majority either to pass the third reading of a constitutional Bill or to suspend Standing Orders, is to disregard the second sentence of standing order 242.I say that if you continue to apply the rulings that have been given on the standing order on suspension of Standing Orders, because it has been held that on the passage of a simple majority, notwithstanding the standing order requirement of an absolute majority, the simple majority prevailed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1)

* By the same reasoning you are compelled to give effective operation to section 23 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which requires that the question as to the third reading of the Bill as amended be passed by the Senate and that is agreed to. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1)

* Then if you ignore the requirement of an absolute majority as required by standing order 242, by reason of the superior force of section 23 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, you also ignore the latter part of the standing order which says 'the Bill shall be laid aside without Question put, and shall not be revived during the same Session'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1)

* I put that to you,  Mr President,  because I can foresee that if the Government does not wish to take the opinion of the judicial structure, the Governor-General may request that that be done, such, I believe, is the complication on a constitutional matter in which the processes of today have involved us.

* In the case of a Bill which seeks to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the Standing Orders provide that this is the way in which it is passed: There is a first reading, a second reading and a third reading; but if the third reading shall not have been carried by an absolute majority the Bill shall be laid aside. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1)

* It is described by its short title as a democratic elections Bill and it purports to be a Bill by which a question will be submitted to the people of Australia by referendum to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> whereby it is stated that the members of the House of Representatives and all the parliaments of the States shall be chosen directly and democratically by the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

* May I say quite simply that the major provision of the Bill is to have an amendment of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so that the House of Representatives and the Parliaments of the States will be chosen from electorates which are relatively equal in size on the basis of the number of people who live in the electorates? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

* That is why it is a wholly fair comment to regard this Bill as a calculated manoeuvre, no matter how attractively it might be couched and described, to ensure that by an electoral distribution written into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the Labor Party will go far towards perpetuating its rule in the House of Representatives.

* I do not desire to go through each of the particular clauses which are sought to be amended but if one were to do so one would find that there is an attempt to amend the various sections of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in a way that is more restrictive of the Parliament's power to pass laws than is the present position. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0)

* In doing so I am not deterred in any way by the argument repeatedly advanced on behalf of the Government in this chamber, in the course of this debate and earlier debates on the constitutional alteration Bills, that somehow or other it is none of the business of the Senate, one of the 2 Houses of Parliament, to deter or impede the Government in putting its suggestions for alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to the people.

* Surely the question of what is the right electoral system for a State parliament should be determined under our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, under a federal system, as we know it, by the parliaments of the States or by the people of the States but certainly not by the rigid provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which is applicable only to the Federal Parliament.

* To the motion for the second reading of the Bill the Senate Opposition has moved that all words after That' be deleted and that the following words be inserted:  the Bill be deferred until after consideration has been given to its proposals by all State governments and by the Australian Constitutional Convention.

* I think I am right in saying that there has not been a referendum which in fact sought to give back power to the States; that is, to relinquish power from the central written <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* I simply say that whilst uniform taxation persists and whilst the Commonwealth exerts its powers of takeover and duress through the uniform taxation device and through section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, any idea of a game of political ping-pong is illusory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* If it is, then of course it will act to do something to rectify the injustices of the present uniform taxation system and the present gross breach of section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* I remind the Senate that the people of Australia decided that they should determine where the power should lie as between the written and fixed <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the Commonwealth and the residual constitutions of the States.

* Whilst the sovereignty lies with the Commonwealth in terms of uniform taxation and in terms of section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, it will always be possible for the Commonwealth, by the duress of finance, to persuade the States to give up certain powers for a defined or indefinite period.

* The fact that proposed section 108b of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> puts all sorts of legalistic qualifications on this matter is, to me, of no importance at all because after a while the power becomes entrenched; after a while the will to take it back is gone and, in fact, the ability to take it back is gone.

* In fact, of that were so, the position of the States today would be entirely different, because the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> sees for the States an entirely different de jure sovereignty from the de facto sovereignty that exists today.

* If it is interested in this matter as a demarcation dispute, to use an industrial term, then why does is not call a conference of the States on the whole range of governmental powers and get a clear demarcation of functions so that we do not have this enormous difficulty that happens all the time of the Commonwealth intruding, by means of section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, into the affairs of the States, in terms of its erosion of these powers and its takeover bids.

* I think it was a unique experience for those of us fortunate enough to be members of that Convention to find that in the great majority of the contributions at that Convention there was general agreement on the need to revise the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* Delegates from the States, from local government and from this National parliament expressed in one way or another a need for the Constitutional Convention or for a referendum to determine these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* I have to stress the fact that this Government has endeavoured to refer matters of constitutional change to the Australian people, not to make some back door arrangement, not to attempt to bypass public opinion, but rather to give the Australian people an opportunity to have a 1970 look at the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which people should know is now well over 70 years old. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* Senator Carrick  quite rightly drew attention to the fact that there is a reluctance on the part of the Australian people to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* If the people are not yet able to see the need to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> it ought to be part of their general education to have the debates in this place presented to them; then by a campaign, to try to make them understand that the responsibilities of government require that they should look at this matter in a more responsible way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* This inevitability of all men failing to agree on important questions meant that the Prime Minister has had to take steps to put a Bill through the House of Representatives, meeting the very strict requirements of an absolute majority of both Houses of Parliament, which is one of the safeguards in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, then have the matter go through the due processes and ultimately to be placed before the Australian people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* Surely as a result of the safeguards that are built into our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and with the good sense of the electors there is ample opportunity for the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to be protected from any act of irresponsibility. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* Surely the Prime Minister ought to be recognised as a very courageous man for taking the steps that he has taken in a period of political difficulty, in this country, seeking to effect changes in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which after all, if agreed to, must still be determined by the Australian people and which would mean only a transference to the Commonwealth of powers that already exist at the State level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* We should have the opportunity to go out and talk to the Australian people to convince them that the time has arrived in Australia's development for updating and modernising the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* But I found, as I have told the Senate before, that it was utterly impossible because of section 92 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and because of interstate trade. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* The purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to enable an interchange of powers between the Australian Parliament and the State parliaments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* So I say that while this Bill which seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and to enable an interchange of powers between the Australian Parliament and the State parliaments is indisputably attractive in its text, it is something that has to be examined very carefully and there must be unanimity between the States and the Commonwealth before a decision is made.

* No matter what may be said by  Senator Greenwood  about alleged attempts by the Prime Minister to mislead the public about the attitude of the States to this offer, I refer him to the report of the proceedings before the Constitutional Convention, which I believe  Senator Greenwood  along with myself attended on the relevant day.

* After the Prime Minister had floated this suggestion which is embodied in this proposed amendment of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the Premiers and representatives of the various States rose in their seats and expressed their reaction to this offer.

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is not altered until the people of Australia, with the difficult processes which have been set out- so difficult that, as many honourable senators have pointed out, there have been few alterations to the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>- as the final arbiters - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0)

* If this does not indicate a paranoid determination by the Opposition to oppose all suggestions for change of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and to deprive the Australian people of their rightgiven to them under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>- to pass judgment on proposals for alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, I do not know what it does.

* The genesis of this proposed amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> appears to have been a discussion which took place at a dinner during the Constitutional Convention last September. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* In this very informal manner an alleged agreement was made between the Prime Minister and those Premiers that in principle they agreed to a constitutional amendment by which the interchange of powers between the Commonwealth and State parliaments would be facilitated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* As I have said, the occasion was the holding of the first sessions of the Constitutional Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* In September of last year a major convention to review the whole of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia was held for the first time for many years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* It was a convention which held and does hold some considerable promise for a thoroughgoing review of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* Maybe it will be able to produce some worthwhile amendments to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which could be expected io obtain the support of the Australian people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* This being the case, it is very odd that in the course of such a convention the Prime Minister and 5 of the 6 State Premiers should informally get together and decide on some amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, particularly when those 6 gentlemen made up only a very small fraction of the total number of people attending this Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* Even if it is true that the agreement about the terms of the Bill was given some imprimatur by the Attorneys-General, it still appears to me to be a preposterous suggestion that that invalidates our independent consideration and judgment of a Bill which proposes that the people be asked to alter the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and to alter it permanently. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* Government senators have said in this debate, as they have said over and over again when speaking on other constitutional alteration legislation, that somehow or other the Senate is not really entitled to consider independently or to oppose Bills which provide for the alteration of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* I have already had some occasion in a previous debate to deal with that point and at this stage I do not wish to do more than reiterate- and reiterate over and over again if I have the opportunity-the fact that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> places upon this Parliament and this chamber the responsibility of proposing amendments to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* How naive is the proposition which was put this afternoon by  Senator James  McClelland that we, with that responsibility on our shoulders, should simply say that, even though we may be opposed to a particular constitutional amendment, even though we may believe that this is a matter that should be given further consideration, and even though it is a matter which perhaps vitally affects the States and which the State governments and the State parliaments should be given the opportunity to discuss before it is put to the people, we should not give any consideration or weight to these things; we should simply pass this Bill through the Senate without exercising any of the responsibilities and judgment which, as I said, are placed upon our shoulders by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The proposal to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in this Bill is, in my view, a very minor question of constitutional amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* A case may be put in favour of an amendment of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> so as to facilitate the reference of powers by the States to the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* An argument may be made that there should be provision for a reference of power by the Commonwealth Parliament to the State parliaments, which provision is absent from the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> at present. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* As I have said, it is a proposal which- I hesitate to say it- emanated from the Constitutional Convention, although that body has not properly considered it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54)

* It may be in the process of considering it, but at this stage it is merely a proposal which emanated from the informal meeting which took place at the time of the Constitutional Convention between the Prime Minister and 5 of the 6 State Premiers.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* It does leave one with an uneasy feeling as to why this Bill should now be rushed on by the Government ahead of all the other major questions for constitutional amendment which are being discussed by a committee of the Constitutional Convention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* The argument that has been put forward here today by  Senator James  McClelland gives force, I believe, to the suspicions which I hold about the purposes of the Government in promoting this amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* Under section 52 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the first of the Commonwealth exclusive powers is the power to legislate with respect to the seat of government of the Commonwealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* It revealed a peculiarity in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which this Parliament under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government immediately rectified. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* The third matter which is an exclusive one under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> relates to any department of the Public Service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* Another one that is mentioned in section 52 refers to other matters declared by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to be within the exclusive powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* Does the Government seriously intend under this <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration Bill to transfer to State parliaments any powers in relation to raising revenue of the nature of excise? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* Therefore I believe it is again trying to hoodwink some of the State Premiers or State Opposition leaders into believing that under this proposed constitutional alteration the States will gain some benefit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* I strongly question the wisdom or the propriety of inserting into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> a power which would have such a major indirect effect on the existing provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* If there is to be such a major change in the revenue raising by the Commonwealth vis-a-vis the States the only proper, open and honest way to do it is to put to the people a referendum that section 90 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> be changed to give the States the right to raise revenue in the nature of excise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* If a major change such as that is to be made and it is the people who are going to pay, it should be their decision by referendum to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in that way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* There is in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> a very salutary provision that the Commonwealth Parliament in raising taxes shall not discriminate between States or between parts of States, yet under this legislation, if it were passed, it appears that the Commonwealth Parliament would have the power to hand the power over to the States without that salutary provision. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* This would completely abrogate and bypass that very important provision in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which provides that taxes imposed by the Commonwealth should be uniform and not discriminatory between the States or parts of States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* We see that either all these provisions, few and all as they are, are not conceivable propositions, they are not meaningful propositions or that they represent a backdoor method of changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in a very material and major way without any reference to the people who should really decide whether major changes are to be made to their <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

* In other words, if the Government wants to make changes to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> it should put the proposals for a clear cut amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> one way or the other and not leave the matter to bargaining that may go on informally at dinner parties or behind closed doors where the people are not consulted and are not able to decide whether they approve of this method of changing the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56)

 Mr President, you, very properly under section 21, studied  Senator Gair's  letter, concluded that it was not a letter of resignation and concluded also that within your powers of determination  Senator Gair  had not resigned and to that extent at least he was still a qualified senator; but that to the extent that events relating to his appointment may have disqualified him under sections 44 and 45 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, you would refer this to the Senate.

* Whether it is constitutionally legal to hold more than one joint sitting on more than one Bill is something that the High Court may determine in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Whether the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill, the Bill we are now debating, is constitutionally legal is a matter for the future to determine. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* What I have said is that I regret very much that the Commonwealth Government in bringing this measure to the Parliament has done nothing to bring to the constitutional convention of the States and the Territories a debate upon the long range future of the 2 Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The purpose of the Bill is very clear; that is, to provide some measure of representation in this chamber for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory as provided for in section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Having been defeated below, the Murphys and the architects of manoeuvre see in section 122 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> a way in which to assail the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Although based upon a federation of 6 States, the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> did advert, of course, to other areas of its jurisdiction, namely the Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Having adverted to that so that we would be entitled to make laws for the Territories and so that we might, in our judgment, allow the representation of the Territories in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on such terms as the Parliament thinks fit, great distinction is drawn in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> between the States and the Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> the federation is shown basically and fundamentally as a federation of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* So with the Whitlam Labor Government having been defeated in the Senate election following the double dissolution, having gained 29 seats only out of 60, and with the people being entitled to expect the other 3 1 senators to defend the cause of senatorial constitutional integrity, we are bound, when this Bill is presented to us after the dissolution, to give it the best of our consideration.

* They are to be improved and guided by this Commonwealth, but their representation in either House of Parliament must be without disrupting to any degree the essential principles of the basis of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* One can go through the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and find provisions such as this: That the Senate shall be composed of senators of each State; and one can go to the provision that was debated this afternoon and which has been put in another Bill in the hope that it will escape attention. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Therefore any senator who represents the people of his State has, I think a most superficial understanding of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and really does not represent the purpose of the people of the State if he allows 36,000 people of the Northern Territory to send in here 2 Territorial representatives or senators- one-fifth of the number representing New South Walesand, having regard to the even balance of the Senate, probably to exercise the preponderant vote in the Senate.

* Is it, in order to save a few of the superficial members of the Senate maybe two or three weeks in the course of a year, to fail to give this issue fuller, more fundamental thought and so prevent the Senate being undermined by a political manoeuvre whereby Whitlam, having expounded himself in the Chifley Memorial lecture on the cause of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> versus Labor now comes to promote the cause of Labor against the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* I believe that those of us who are opposing this legislation because of the need to preserve the Senate are taking a view more in keeping with what was intended by the people who drew up the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of this country and set up the 2 Houses of Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The founding fathers ensured that the constitutional rights of the States were maintained and protected by providing in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> equality of representation of the original States on the basis that the colonies prior to Federation were equal constitutionally and politically. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides in section 122 that the Parliament may allow representation of Commonwealth Territories 'in either House of the Parliament to the extent and  on  the terms which it thinks fit'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* But such Territory representatives in the Senate under this Bill are to have full voting rights and could as non-State representatives hold the balance of power in an institution set up to safeguard the interests of the States- a principle embodied in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> without which Federation would not have been accomplished. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Although provision was made in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> for representation of Territories in the Parliament, our founding fathers did not envisage that such representatives would have voting rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* In fact, concern was expressed at the constitutional discussions that the provision did not preclude such representatives having the right to vote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* Unfortunately we are stuck with a <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which those wise founding fathers made it almost impossible to alter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* If we do find it hard to change the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> let us not try to pretend that all the wisdom of the ages is enshrined in this already old fashioned document. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0)

* The basis upon which the Representation Bill is put forward is that the formula under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and also under the Representation Act whereby there is a nexus between the number of members of the House of Representatives and the number of senators is to be altered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0)

* Let me put it this way: The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> states that the number of members of the House of Representatives shall be twice the number of senators. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0)

* Then section 24 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> sets out a procedure whereby the number of members of the House of Representatives from each State is to be determined. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0)

* The Government has said in the second reading speeches which have accompanied this Bill that on the legal advice available to the Government the people of the Territories are not to be included in the expression 'the people of the Commonwealth' in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0)

* To keep the nexus in position is to ensure that there is no enlargement of the Parliament beyond what is the reasonable anticipation of the founders of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and the thinking of the people of Australia.

* He asked the Prime Minister whether he was aware of the doubt surrounding the justification for a double dissolution in the light of the Senate's second failure to pass the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, due to the fact that the period of 3 months, as required by section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, did not elapse between the Senate's first rejection of the Bill and the second passing of the Bill by the House of Representatives.

* It would be intolerable if a Labor Government were to use the alibi of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to excuse failure to achieve its socialist objectives-doubly intolerable because it is just not true that it need do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64)

* The Prime Minister is using section 96 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to take over the public hospitals of Australia and to shrink the private hospitals and absorb them into a nationalised scheme.

* I make that point in respect of the provisions of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as they could conceivably apply to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* Although the provisions of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> are probably very well known to most of us by now, I think it is important that I should read this section again for the purposes of establishing my argument. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* The view that we on this side of the Senate wish to express firmly is that the advice which must have given to the Governor-General by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitiam)  in order to establish that ground of double dissolution did not satisfy, and could not conceivably satisfy, the provision of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* It certainly could be said that at that stage the first step required under section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> had been completed in that the House of Representatives had presented a proposed law which the Senate, on 2 April had rejected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* I shall quote a high constitutional authority in relation to this matter with which I am sure the Government will not disagree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* It is not conceivable that the Government would suggest that the Bill, having been rejected only on 2 April and rejected- or perhaps honourable senators might say 'failed to pass'- on 10 April, should possibly in any way satisfy the conditions of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* The question of when section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> comes into operation, whether for a double dissolution or for a joint sitting, or for both, is of the highest constitutional importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* The Senate would lose all its character under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, all its independence, its principle of equal representation of the States and its role as a House of review, apart altogether from its other duties and responsibilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* So we believe that this issue is of the most fundamental importance to the Senate and to the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and we believe that it is appropriate that we should express this view in debate, have it enshrined in the records of the Senate and have it made known to the Australian public and to the Governor-General.

* In the constitutional instrument issued for that purpose,  His Excellency  noted that the conditions upon which he was empowered by section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously had been fulfilled in respect of six proposed laws, including the Bill for the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* May I interpolate here,  Mr President,  that, whilst the amendment purports to be concerned with the observance of the procedures of section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the underlying complaint of the Opposition with the Bill is to be found in those few words in which the amendment asks that the Bill be 're-drafted as a new Bill'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0)

* But, instead of getting on with the debate on the merits of the Bill, the Opposition, by this amendment, seeks to raise an issue that is irrelevant for present purposes and is one with which it is constitutionally inappropriate for the Senate to concern itself.

* The Opposition believes that although it is appropriate for the question of the Commonwealth's sovereignty over the off-shore areas to be resolved, although we support the claim to sovereignty and although we support in principle the idea that the Commonwealth Government should have a broad legal and constitutional sovereignty over these areas, when all is said and done we are even at the present time engaged in an international conference at which we are asserting very broad claims over the continental shelf extending seawards 200 miles or more.

* I put it to the Parliament that the Government cannot have it both ways, lt seems strange, putting it in the lowest possible key, to claim that these people would be full senators for the purposes of some sections of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>- for example, section 22 and 23 relating to votes and quorums in the Senate- but not in others, for example, section 24 relating to the nexus between the number of senators and the number of members in the House of Representatives.

* But before going into the substance of the legislation I say that when this Bill last came before the House of Representatives I said that there were grounds for grave doubt as to whether the passage of the Bill through the 2 Houses of Parliament conformed to section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to enable it to be a double dissolution issue.

* But because we chose in 1959 to call an Act the 'Matrimonial Causes Act' it does nothing to define or limit the powers which the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> gave to the Commonwealth- namely, the powers over marriage, divorce and matrimonial causes and in relation thereto parental rights and the custody and guardianship of infants.

* If the members of the sub-committee take the trouble to read the commentary by Quick and Garran on section 16 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> they will learn, if they do not already know, that even before any question of proportional representation was involved in election to the Senate the procedure for filling a casual vacancy under section 1 5 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was regarded- this is supported by the convention debates- as an extremely temporary measure until either the expiration of the term of office of the vacating senator or the next House of Representatives or Senate election.

* One way in which not only the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> but also responsible politicians down the years have attempted to retain some meaning in the democratic process is by the convention or practice, call it what you will, that when a senator vacates his seat, for whatever reason, he will be replaced by a member of the political party to which he belonged.

* I think it is fairly clear to everybody in Australia and certainly quite clear to everybody in the Senate that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the present Government would like to carry out some fairly drastic surgery on the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the Commonwealth of Australia.

* I would also like to refer to the Government's recent attempts to amend the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> because that will get us away from mere words and give us actions by which we can judge the Government and its attitude to the shape of Australia's administration and government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* I point out that it was fairly clear at the time that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was enacted that this section was to be only an interim measure because it refers to 'a period of 10 years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* It stands, amongst other things, for amendment of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to clothe the Parliament of Australia with such plenary powers as are necessary and desirable to achieve international co-operation, national planning and the party's economic and social objectives.

* If honourable senators look at the published documents of the Labor Party, and in particular to some of the addresses of its present leader and the present Prime Minister of Australia,  Mr Whitlam,  they will find a fairly clear indication of why the Labor Party finds the present constitutional arrangements in Australia quite unsatisfactory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* I can summarise what I am about to quote from a speech by  Mr Whitlam  by saying that the Labor Party resents the fact that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> represents some fetter on its ability to do whatever it likes to the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* That heading in itself is fairly instructive because we see the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> set up as an opponent of Labor and therefore something which presumably is to be tackled by it and battled with.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* In that brief extract I think it is made clear that we have an attitude in the Labor Party which is born of the fact that it sees the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as preventing it from imposing its pattern on the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0)

* In more recent times- I move to November 1973- one gets a fairly clear indication that  Mr Whitlam  no longer sees the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which gives a clear delineation of functions between the States and the Commonwealth, as something which will stand in his way.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0)

* In the back of the minds of the writers of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was the idea that while the membership of the House of Representatives could change at each election, the Senate still carried a reflection of the thought prevailing for 3 years before the election so there would not be a complete change in the outlook of the Senate as there would be in the House of Representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0)

* When the position is considered in that way, it makes it more clear in my mind that it was in the minds of the writers of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> that there should be sufficient period of time between the election of each half of the Senate so that there could be a carry-over of opinion, not for just 12 months but for 3 years.

* If this be the case, and there is a landslide to the Left or to the Right, the Senate undoubtedly will become purely and simply a rubber stamp of the government of the day and of no value whatever to the community that it is written into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to serve in the form of a responsible brake, a guardian.

* Of course there can be no doubt that both those arguments are valid, but the weakness surely is that they must ultimately lead to the abolition of the Senate and they must ultimately lead to the total uselessness of the Senate in carrying out the function which the founders of this <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> envisaged for it.

* Under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the High Court is the sole voice in deteriming whether matters which affect the relations of the State and the Commonwealth inter se may be taken to the Privy Council and it is generally thought that the High Court, in the reasonings which it has used in recent years, would not grant the certificate which would enable that matter to be taken to the Privy Council.

* The <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of each State of the Commonwealth shall, subject to this <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be, until altered in accordance with the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of the State.

* With those guidelines, sincere people desiring to expose but not to expand the true constitutional limits would say: 'When Federation was established we established a High Court and a federal judiciary', which in relation to the next Bill to be debated by the Senate I shall try to demonstrate that the Government is seeking to confuse and condemn the country by exploitation 'but in the State sphere we maintained the Supreme Courts, the State judiciaries, the State Constitutions, the State powers and the State laws'.

* It arises out of the fact that in erecting courts, our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> copied without sufficient consideration, it is suggested, the system from the American <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> providing for a dual system of courts, one system the Federal courts and the other the State courts.

* Secondly, a provision was introduced into our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which was not in the American <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which enabled this Parliament, when needing jurisdiction to enforce the Federal laws, to invest that jurisdiction in the State courts so that the State courts could amply operate as agencies to administer the Federal law in addition to the State law which was their inherent responsibility.

 His Honour had also made great contribution to this cause in the evidence which he submitted before the Royal Commission on the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in 1929, presided over by  Mr Justice  Nicholas.

* I refer to the evidence that he gave at page 99 of the report of the Royal Commission where he, referring to sections of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> relevant to this, said:   the greatest difficulty and confusion have arisen, and an incredible burden has been placed upon the litigant who has the misfortune to be affected in his litigation by any Federal law or any other matter with which sections 75 and 76 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> are concerned.

* However effectual such provisions may be for ensuring that the High Court retains an almost exclusive authority to declare the meaning and effect of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, no one can fail to see that this is done at the expense of rendering almost futile and impossible the practical administration of justice for the purpose of adjusting the real controversies between subject and subject or redressing real grievances which a subject may have against the Crown.

* I wish the Senate to know that I have taken upon myself, with assistance, of course, the task of devising an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> that will alter completely the judicature section of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and create one judicial system in Australia so that this intricate, dry, complex and arid division between State and Federal jurisdictions will disappear.

* Let us go back to the position at the time of Federation as we see it delineated in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the document which the Opposition embraces and for which it expresses reverence when it suits it and when it does not suit it it damns with faint praise or discards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Section 7 1 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> recognises that Commonwealth judicial power would be exercised in 3 streams of jurisdiction: Firstly, the High Court of Australia; secondly such other Federal courts as the Parliament created; and thirdly such other courts as it invests with Federal jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Section 75 and 76 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> went on to provide that the High Court should have or should be capable of being invested by the Parliament with jurisdiction in all the matters which are now set out in clause 19 of the Bill before the Senate as the subject of the original jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* With regard to the latter power it is significant that Quick and Garran in their commentaries on the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> indicate their judgment as to the comparative temporary basis for the exercise of that jurisdiction.

* The wisdom of the founding fathers of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which was challenged so heavily by the Government during the Joint Sitting last year was shown in the fact that they considered the establishment of a federal court and rejected it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* The result of that growth has been that, unless the number of High Court justices is increased, there is a serious risk that the volume of work in the original jurisdiction of the High Court will inhibit the Court's capacity to fulfil its principal role as an arbiter of constitutional questions and as the nation's ultimate appellate court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* Because of the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> requiring all judges to have, in effect, life tenure, the Commonwealth, unlike the States, cannot relieve its justices on a temporary basis by the appointment of acting justices to deal with arrears or accumulations of business as they occur from time to time.

* Apart from the creation of two Federal courts of limited specialised jurisdiction, namely the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Federal Bankruptcy Court, the High Court in its original jurisdiction and the various State courts exercising Federal jurisdiction have dealt with all matters arising under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and Federal statutes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* With the full support of the Chief Justice, the Government has decided that it should follow the alternative course, which is available under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, of investing State Supreme Courts and the Supreme Courts of the mainland Territories with original jurisdiction in certain additional federal matters in respect of which the High Court now exercises original jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* That would have the consequence, it is put, of speeding up the work of the High Court and enabling it to concentrate on its essential function in a growing and increasingly complex society as custodian of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and as the highest appellate court in the land. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0)

* I believe that, even in 1900, it was envisaged by the founding fathers of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> that there would be the growth of a Federal or national judicial system to deal with matters arising under Commonwealth power.

* Back in the time when the proposition of a Superior Court was dear to the hearts of Liberal lawyers- do not forget that it originated from them- the most obviously persuasive reason which they had was that the High Court was overloaded with the work in its original jurisdiction, that a backlog was developing and that the Court's reputation for promptness and the Court's preoccupation with its great task of interpreting the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was in some way downgraded by its concern with what were thought to be lesser matters- taxation matters, matters involving patents and that sort of thing.

* I propose to support the motion that has been moved for the referral to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns of questions relating to the qualifications of  Senator Webster,  and I also propose to support the amendment which has been moved by  Senator Withers  and which will have the effect of appointing a judicial committee of inquiry to examine the types of circumstance in which other members of Parliament may have contravened provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and will enable the Senate and the House of Representatives to be informed of any such instances.

* I do not believe that the law would be upheld or that right would be done if that were the case, because we have before us at present a prima facie case which, in my judgment- and I think that every senator must look at it in terms of how he views those facts- warrants consideration either by this chamber or by the High Court as to whether or not  Senator Webster  has contravened the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* If we were to delay in doing that, particularly when the delay was simply to find out if other persons could be sent at the same time, then we would not be upholding the law as we should give an example of upholding it, and we would not be upholding the institution of Parliament, which must not be seen to be or accused of taking a favoured position with regard to one or some of its members who may have contravened provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The tone of that degeneration was set by those senators who, despite the fact there is to be a High Court hearing in relation to  Senator Webster  which must resolve certain general issues regarding the meaning of the provisions in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and despite the fact that there is to be a judicial inquiry on the wide range as set out in the amendment, bandied names across the chamber in a manner which must have disgusted those who are truly interested in arriving at a resolution of this difficult matter.

* I suggest that that would not have been responsible and would have been open to the interpretation, especially when the scenario had developed to a stage once when it was suggested that 17 members of the Parliament were involved, that it was an attempt to shield members of Parliament from the effects of the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, and to have ignored the matter would in my submission have been unthinkable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* The second alternative for the Government was to invite the Senate to determine the matter itself if the view were taken, as a majority of the Senate took the view about a year ago in relation to  Senator Gair,  that the Parliament had not, by enacting the Electoral Act, excluded its jurisdiction under section 47 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* The second point is that despite what has been said this afternoon,  Senator Webster's  case, I understand by resolution of the Senate, is about to be referred to the High Court of Australia, sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns, and the public can be confident that the High Court will interpret the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, insofar as such interpretation is appropriate for the determination of  Senator Webster's  case, with its normal impartiality.

* The judicial committee of inquiry, which could be one that hopefully will consist of more than one experienced and eminent judge, will be required to examine the types of circumstances in which the receipt by members of the Parliament of moneys, fees and other benefits might constitute a breach and, secondly, any other questions relating to members of the Parliament which could properly be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns and, finally, whether the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in the present day circumstances and conditions are appropriate.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* I say this in the context of the greatly escalated governmental presence in all aspects of day to day business activities and the hidden and unrealised dangers inherent in this situation so far as members of the Parliament might unwittingly act in breach of these provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* The word 'unwittingly' was used and I have no doubt that  Senator Webster  had absolutely no idea that sales made to a government department by his family organisation in the normal and open course of business could be in contravention of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and place him at risk so far as his position in this Parliament is concerned.

* In the course of the deliberations of this Committee a man named, I think, Brown and a newspaper reporter of the Melbourne 'Age' appeared before the Committee and drew to the attention of the Committee certain matters in which it was felt that  Senator Webster,  who was my  Deputy, Mr President,  as he is your  Deputy,  was in breach of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, under sections 44 and 45 of that document. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45)

* Let me make it clear to the Senate that because of the evidence coming before the Committee from a variety of persons the proposition was put by members of the Committee including, I believe,  Senator Webster,  that there was no need for a register because the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> had certain provisions.

* 1 draw his specific attention to the requirement that any officer who makes payment of such unauthorised expenditure, unauthorised by the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, should be surcharged and accountable in the same way as recent disqualifications of members of this place involve its sanctions, because we cannot rely upon proper safeguard of the expenditure which we authorise line by line unless the time has come for the Auditor-General to be asked to come here and to explain why he has vouched that expenditure if it is not reasonably in accordance with a provision of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* I recognise some of the problems which flow from  Senator Wright's  interjection, but is it to be accepted, if you can utilise this external affairs power because there is an international Convention made by the United Nations which is ratified, that you can search out some friendly neighbouring country and, on the pretext that you have made a treaty with that country, override virtually all the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> simply to give effect to obligations which have been made with a small and relatively insignificant neighbour.

* The present Bill, with the stated objective by the Minister to re-establish the Inter-State Commission in accordance with the provisions of section 101 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, is something with which we concur, But the fact is that the Bill has no relationship to the original Commission, which was established and later abolished, nor has it any relationship to the terms of the Minister's second reading speech.

* Before I go into that I remind the Senate that the proposal in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> that there should be an Inter-State Commission was adopted from the experience of Great Britain co-ordinating the many private enterprise railways that had been established in the last century in that country, and it is interesting that that organisation had an early experience somewhat comparable with that of our own InterState Commission in Australia.

* More particularly, perhaps, did the founding fathers look to the American institution, the Federal Inter-State Commission, which has operated with expanding authority in the Federation which was our parent so far as constitutional structure is concerned, namely, the United States of America from then to now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0)

* So, in our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> section 102 provided that there shall be an Inter-State Commission with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance of the constitutional provisions and laws of trade and commerce.

* In that situation, where it was necessary to weld together 6 separately existing colonies, with their own governments, and a new national government with these powers, surely it was not only sensible from the point of view of history but also on any theory of government to require the establishment of a pseudo-judicial executive body to form an Inter-State Commission with powers of adjudication and administration such as Parliament thought necessary to maintain and execute the federal laws, including the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, relating to trade and commerce.

* The very basis of the ruling by Chief Justice Dixon, under section 92 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> that the States were refusing, through that road law, to allow transport to be absolutely free, was the fact that the States endeavoured, by a licensing system, to say, 'Smith, you can run there: Jones, you shall have no licence.

* We ought to realise that in Australia we suffer from the grave disability that the central government, the Federal government- call it what you like- has completely inadequate economic powers, so much so that in December of 1973 it went to the people to obtain a constitutional change to give it power with respect to incomes and prices.

* Of course, as we all know, it is a matter of history that the <span class="highlight">constitution</span> of the Commission originally was ill-fated and that it met its real test in the wheat case of 1915. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0)

* I suggest that the functions of those 2 bodies were far removed from what the founders of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> had in mind and were far removed from what we in Australia need now, and that is a body to remove preferences and discriminations in the field of trade and commerce in general, and in transport particularly.

* One can draw that inference very simply from the structure of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>- chapter 1 dealing with the Parliament, chapter 2 dealing with the Executive, chapter 3 dealing with the judiciary and a separate chapter 4 dealing with trade and commerce and containing the very provisions which are the basis of this legislation, namely in sections 101 and following sections.

* I do not lapse into legalism, but the point I wish to make is that the purpose of the InterState Commission, as it was envisaged by the framers of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was that it was designed to deal with problems which arose from discrimination so far as valid laws were concerned.

* If the Government allows any one person in Australia not to be paid, not to get any money- the Government has now retreated, as it had to do, in relation to pensions and repatriation- it is the Government's responsibility and nobody else's responsibility because the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> compels it under these circumstances to go to the people.

* No matter how  Senator Cotton  or the lawyers whom he quotes may try to twist the words of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> there is no doubt that it was not contemplated that a government in a moment of unpopularity could be thrown out by an unrepresentative Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* He took it upon himself to issue gratuitous advice to the Governor-General which was out of tune with anything I have read from any constitutional lawyer and which does not stand up to examination in the light of the sections of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which he was attempting to construe.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* The Prime Minister misled the people, and in the first flush of his statement there was a reaction by the public that the Senate may not have acted constitutionally. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* The people who wrote the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> around the turn of the century put these provisions in for very good reasons and for very clear purposes because they knew, and this needs to be restated all these years later, that the smaller States- that is, those smaller in populationwould not be in the Federation and would not have voted for Federation unless they had some protection given to them in the Senate.

* These provisions within the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> plainly establish, and it needs to be repeated again and again that while the Senate of itself may not amend what we understand as money Bills it can pass them, reject them or defer them and it has this right because it is equal in powers with the House of Representatives in respect of such measures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* It needs to be said again also that the people who put the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> together in those early years did not confer these powers, these authorities and rights upon the Senate for nothing.

* That the Senate affirms that it has the constitutional right to act as it did and now that there is a disagreement between the Houses of the Parliament and a position may arise where the normal operations of government cannot continue, a remedy is presently available to the Government under section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to resolve the deadlock. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* That divine right, as  Senator Wriedt,  my friend, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, mentioned, is in essence the concept that the only person entitled to proffer advice to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, despite all the matters that are embedded in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, is the Prime Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* In other words, the people made a decision inside the terms of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and awarded to the Senate a supervisory power from the time of that election to the present day. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* Eventually that culminated in an attempt by the Senate to bring before the Bar of the Senate some public servants in order to throw some light, through them, upon this murky constitutional process that had taken place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39)

* So we had the curious situation of the Prime Minister directing public servants appearing before this chamber to refuse to answer questions on the basis that to do so would be a breach of Crown privilege, whereas in fact the Prime Minister himself was in breach of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as he was claiming privilege for an area in which there existed no privilege because an illegal act had occurred.

* I call as witness the Prime Minister of Australia and the documents relating to the double dissolution which were tabled in the Senate yesterday Honourable senators will find by persuasive reading that it is said repeatedly that because the Senate has declined to grant Supply the constitutional practice is that the Prime Minister must go to the Governor-General and seek a double dissolution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* The fundamental situation is that section 53 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> gives to the Senate the one responsibility and the one power which enables a government, which is a wrecking government, which is a destructive government, which is a government doing permanent damage to the people, to be brought to the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* Let me move on to the constitutional question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* A number of lawyers, academics and ordinary members of the public have expressed their views on the constitutional legality and/or propriety of what the Opposition is doing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* The view that I want to put to the Senate- it is a view that I expressed publicly in Queensland recently- is that the constitutional fabric which clothes Australian society does not consist solely of the written <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* It consists also of the body of rules, precedents and practices which have been built up over a period of three-quarters of a century and which, in line with the development of the constitutions of other countries where those constitutions are not written, comprise just as important a part of our constitutional fabric as does the written <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* Therefore, I am prepared to concede for the purposes of this debate, because I have conceded it publicly that the Senate does have, according to the written <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the strict legal power to reject- but, I will suggest later, not to continue to defer- a money Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* That is only half of the constitutional position that has to be met by an Opposition which will be judged in history as to whether it is acting with constitutional propriety. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* I repeat that side by side with that written <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> there lies that body of practice, convention and rules without which this country could not have survived over a period of three-quarters of a century including 2 world wars. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* If that view is correct, then there can be no doubt whatsoever that the Opposition is behaving unconstitutionally in this situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* I do not say 'illegally' in the sense that court action could be taken against the Opposition or that in some way a judgment of a court could be obtained to the effect that what it is doing is constitutionally illegal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* But if 50 per cent of our constitutional fabric is the written <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and the other 50 per cent is that body of rules, practice and conventions that I assert it is, then the Opposition, on its own stance, stands convicted of having acted unconstitutionally in this matter and of persisting in acting unconstitutionally in this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* The second constitutional matter to which I wish to refer is the assertion that was made by  Senator Rae  last week and repeated, although without detailed argument, by  Senator Carrick  this afternoon. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* It is that the situation which now confronts the Senate could be solved quite simply because the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, so they said, had written into it the means whereby this very problem could be solved, namely, section 57 and a double dissolution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* The suggestion of  Senator Rae  that section 57 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> was intended to provide the safeguard for the solution of the type of problem that now confronts the Senate indicates, I suggest, a situation that is either impracticable or at times impossible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57)

* Yet we have heard  Senator Rae, Senator Carrick  and, I believe, another senator- I shall not name her because I am not certain in her case- saying that the simple solution to this was put into the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> deliberately.

* One would expect that there should be some justification for the manner in which a government which was elected for 3 years was subjected to re-election after serving 18 months in office and, after getting a second mandate from the people found that after another short period it again had to face the people as a result of an action which I have described as being contrary to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> of Australia.

* The election not only provided an endorsement for my Leader, the new Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, my colleagues who formed the caretaker ministry and who now form the Cabinet and Government of this country, and the policies of the coalition parties, but also asserted once again that the Senate has a role, rights and a place in our bicameral system, that the legitimacy of our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> overrides the wishes of any Prime Minister and that the Governor-General has and can use the reserve powers which are given to him in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* As the Senate standing order indicates, these Bills dealing with the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> concern provisions that are at the basis of our government and are likely to be of some permanence inasmuch as any alterations to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> adopted by the people can be altered later only by a referendum of the people and not by Act of Parliament.

* However tainted the Government's motives might be in introducing this <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill- terms such as political expediency, deceit, cynicism and hypocrisy, among others, have been thrown around by members of the Liberal Party of Australia and in my view the motive is quite clearly and incontestably the desire of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to protect half of his senators from the wrath of the electorate 12 months hence- the Bill provides an opportunity for significant constitutional reform.

* The opposing cases, as I see it, are that on one hand this Bill is being presented as a convenient adjustment of the mechanics of the election provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>; on the other, it is being opposed in my case on the grounds that enactment of this legislation would result in a substantial and radical change in the nature of the Senate and in the distribution of political power in Australia in a way which I believe would be to the long term detriment of this country.

* Mr President,  if I believed that such a measure would weaken the Senate in any way, much less make a profound change in our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> at the expense of the fundamental consensus it represents, I certainly would not be supporting it, much less be prepared to promote it in the Senate on behalf of the Government.

* Having regard to an analysis, as best I have been able to make one, of the arguments made against this proposal, namely, that it will weaken the Senate and so on, having regard to the existing provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, having regard to the most recent history which I have mentioned, I cannot really accept the argument- I certainly have no fears about thisthat this proposal will have the effect of weakening the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* Certainly, it could not make profound changes to our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> because, as  Senator Chaney  has said, the major power of the Senate resides in its equal representation from the States and the influence which the less populous States have in the Parliament by reason of that representation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50)

* It certainly will not reside or be maintained if the Senate takes the view that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> or any power to alter it can never be entertained, that there is something absolutely sacrosanct in every word of the present <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>.

* I suggest that that could be achieved by making a simple amendment to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> as expressed in clause 3, giving this Parliament instead of the State parliaments power to make laws for determining the times of elections of honourable senators, if the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> goes on and includes a condition which provides that elections of senators in all States and Territories shall be held on the same day and at the same time as general elections for the House of Representatives.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34)

* With regard to clause 3, the only provision that the Bill makes concerning elections is to state that this Parliament may make laws for determining the times of elections of senators, whereas the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, presently unamended, states that the State Parliaments may make laws for determining the times of elections of senators. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34)

* Certainly if those fixed terms remain in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the only way to give effect to this amendment would be for a House of Representatives election to be held every 3 years at the same time as an election for half the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34)

* Honourable senators have been talking about profound changes and so on being made to the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> by this Bill but if House of Representatives elections must be held at the same time as Senate elections, that is, virtually at fixed times, then we are facing a fundamental change in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34)

* Therefore any tying of elections for the House of Representatives with fixed terms with Senate elections, which is the effect of  Senator Wright's  amendment, would be a fundamental change in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and it is not one which this Government certainly is proposing or would propose.

* In 1974, words similar to what  Senator Wright  has just said moved senior members of the then Opposition, who are now members of the Government, to say that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill should be opposed because it was a direct attack on the powers of this chamber and would substantially transfer power from the States and from the States' Houses to the Executive Government.

* That indicates a fundamental lack of appreciation of the constitutional safeguard of section 57 which provides that if the House of Representatives sends to the Senate a Bill which fails to pass and after an interval of 3 months the Bill comes again from the House of Representatives and we again fail to pass it, then, and then only, there may be a dissolution of the Senate, accompanied by a simultaneous dissolution of the House of Representatives.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34)

* The Committee is dealing with clause 4, which seeks to alter section 12 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> to provide  inter aiia  that the writs shall be issued within 14 days from the date on which the places to be filled become vacant.

* The reason for the new provision is that the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> has always provided that the writs are to be issued by the Governors of the States rather than by the Governor-General.

* I want to comment on the matters raised in the recent debate by saying that, if one looks at some examples of what might possibly occur, bearing in mind what has happened in Australian politics in the past, and at the sorts of things which might precipitate a House of Representatives election, one would have to agree that to have this absolute provision in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is undesirable.

* At the present time section 32 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> provides that the writs for the House of Representatives must be issued within 10 days from the expiry of the House of Representatives or from the proclamation of a dissolution thereof.

* For that sort of reason and for a host of other reasons about which I would like to speak but about which time does not permit me to speak, I would like to stress to the Senate the importance of ensuring that our <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> is not monkeyed with on a basis which panders to popularity and not to principle.

* Perhaps the central unhappy feature of the regime to which I have referred is the anti-radical decree of 1972 which led to the establishment of the office for the protection of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, the development by that office of the concept of enemy of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> and the associated development of the system of Berufsverbote which translates as professional disbarment or a ban on following one's chosen profession.

* One example was that of a mature aged trainee teacher, not a member of the Communist Party or any of its multifarious offshoots, in West Germany whose offences apparently were twofold: First, to organise his fellow trainee teachers when they were threatened with a salary deduction, to threaten a strike- not actually to carry it out- against the authorities; and, secondly, to sign in company with a number of other people who were communists- I repeat that apparently he was not- an open letter protesting against the violation of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in Chile.

* First of all, it gives a detailed analysis, Tor really the first time in the legal literature, of the nature, scope and extent of section 5 1 (xxvi) of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, which of course empowers the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws .

* However, whilst there is now to be a black Rhodesian Prime Minister and many more black Rhodesians in the political arena than previously, under the new <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> white Rhodesians will almost certainly retain a disproportionate level of influence in the Parliament, the Cabinet, the Army, the Police and the Public Service.

* As we took evidence throughout the country, and as we talked to constitutional authorities, we were very firmly of the view that the evidence established clearly that the Commonwealth had what we called a coalescence of power in a number of fields, including taxation, defence, foreign affairs, fisheries and quarantine, which gave it sufficient legislative competence to lay down and enforce a national approach through legislation alone.

* It is appropriate, however, that the provisions for justices of the High Court be made in a separate Bill because of the special position occupied by that Court which is the court established under the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> whereas other federal courts are created by the Commonwealth Parliament.

* In passing I make one further point about the offence and penalty provisions in this Bill, and that is to draw the Government's attention- if it is not already aware of it- to an article by  Mr John  Willis in the  Australian Law Journal  for September 1978, volume 52, page 502, entitled: To What Extent is s. 235 of the Customs Act 1901-1975 (Cth) Invalid as Contravening s. 80 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>', It seems to me that  Mr Willis  has made a very interesting argument to the effect that to the extent that section 235 vests not in the jury but in the judge the power of determining to its satisfaction that particular factual conditions have been made out, this provision may well be in breach of section 80 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which demands on its face that there be a jury trial for all aspects of the court determination of an indictable offence.

* The constitutional justification of this was the external affairs power; the doctrine that if we enter into a valid external treaty that obliges us to do certain things, the existence of the treaty gives the Commonwealth Parliament the powers necessary to give effect to the treaty, even to the extent of powers which would otherwise be beyond Commonwealth competence.

* That raises the issue, which I want to mention briefly in the Senate, of the meaning and application of section 80 of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which is the provision in the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> which purports, on the face of it, to guarantee jury trial in Federal criminal matters.

* I am not suggesting for a moment that we should use the occasion of the passage of these Bills to resolve this long-standing situation; but I hope that one day either the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> can be changed to give genuine meat and content to section 80 or, alternatively, that Commonwealth legislation, of which this is a central part, can be amended to provide for a genuine right of trial by jury in all serious cases.

* This represents a major concession to what the States have been trying to achieve ever since Federation, or at least since about 1920, when in the engineers case for the first time the Court started behaving as a truly national institution, concerned to interpret and to apply the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>, where there was ambiguity in its terms, in such a way that national interests and concerns took precedence over parochial ones, and in such a way that there would be a possibility for genuine national-sized solutions to national-sized problems.

* However, we believe that in order to achieve this the critical consideration is not a question of geographical balance sustained over time, or at any given point of time, in the composition of the Court, but rather the certainty that the best men and women in the nation are appointed to the Court,, the best both in terms of their scholarly ability and technical expertise across the range of law with which they have to deal- especially constitutional law- and in terms of the kind of vision and breadth of understanding and approach that they bring to their job.

* The Labor Government, when introducing its own corporations and securities industry legislation in 1 974 and when foreshadowing the further introduction of substantive companies legislation which was to be introduced in that illfated week in November 1975, was certainly satisfied that the corporation's power in section 51(xx) of the <span class="highlight">Constitution</span> in itself, provided sufficiently ample constitutional foundation for this kind of legislation.
