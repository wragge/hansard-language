* That the proposal of the Labor Government to direct Commonwealth Government departments and authorities to grant contracts for work and for the supply of goods to firms considered to be good union firms is indicative of the prejudiced tactics of the Labor Government to bring special benefits to <span class="highlight">unions</span> and union officials.

* If they are opposed to joining trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> I believe that they have complete freedom to refuse to join, but if they do refuse they have no more right to continue to work in an industry that has benefited from the activity of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> than a person entering primary production has to ignore a board set upto market his product.If persons are honest in refusing to join a trade union they have complete freedom to enter industries that are not covered by trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* I can say only that the Minister for Labour before he left for overseas put forward proposals to settle the differences between the Federated Clerks Union of Australia and the airlines, a settlement which in the opinion of the Minister would be reasonable and based upon the submissions of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> on equal pay. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0)

* If so, why is it necessary for a meeting of the Prime Minister, 2 Cabinet Ministers and representatives of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> to determine the Government's action on its own policy?

* Turning to that part of the question which referred to the 35-hour week, it is a studied program of the Australian Labor Party that in respect of the power industry a proposal to introduce a 35-hour week would be supported where it can be demonstrated by the <span class="highlight">unions</span> that no excessive overtime would arise from the adoption of such a reduction in working hours.

* My criticism is that the legislation does not do what it set out to do, that is, to make credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> attractive for young people to continue saving with for the purpose of getting a homes savings grant because it is obvious that only one - perhaps none - of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> can meet the requirements of the legislation.

* What it has apparently done is to take the general ratio of lending of some of the larger banking institutions in relation to housing and the specific amount of individual loans as being the general criteria on which credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> must seek to work if they wish to be recognised institutions for the purposes of the young people saving money to become eligible for a grant, lt has reduced these amounts by a small percentage.

* not have been more logical - if we genuinely want to make some of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> eligible in this field - to take what was their usual standard, not the usual standard of the big banking institutions, and increase it by a certain amount so that at least they would have something to strive and reach for? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

* But unless the figure of 7,000 can be reduced to some extent the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> are debarred by the very legislation that, is said to admit-them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

* What has been the purpose of the legislation its far as the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> are concerned? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

* There must be something wrong when a piece of legislation is said to assist the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> and they themselves say: 'Baloney, lt does not assist us at all and it will not make a scrap of difference'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

* It is an amendment with which we cannot agree at this stage because we believe that it opens the door completely in admitting credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, contains no restraints whatsoever and therefore could easily lead to very considerable abuses not necessarily by the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> that exist today but by people seeing opportu.nities to form very small credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> with no other purpose than to make a particular person eligible for a homes savings grant.That would bc most undesirable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

* We also believe that the section of the legislation that makes it mandatory for credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to provide by way of housing loans $50,000 in any one financial year and in every subsequent financial year is an impossible condition to place upon credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> at this time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

* I believe that, at least for a start, these very stringent conditions on the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, which would be easy conditions for the major banking institutions of this country to meet, should be reduced to levels that are more possible for the larger credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to meet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

* We hope that by the time we reach the Committee stage of the Bill we will be able to agree on something that will open the door just a little wider and allow a reasonable number of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to participate in the legislation - something that I for one am prepared to say was the intention of the Government when it formulated the idea of this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0)

* The Opposition has criticised the amendments which relate to credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, but I think the matters raised by  Senator Poke  prove conclusively the point  that the  Government has been making all along, that the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>  are  not established for the purpose of providing money for housing and, therefore, they do not in their present form come within the scope of the purpose of the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* On the other hand, what is being suggested in the amendments is to give an opportunity for the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to restructure their organisations so that they will become a useful source of credit for housing and a useful source of funds for housing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* 1 feel that the Government is doing the right thing with these amendments in respect of  Ihe  credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> in suggesting  to  the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> that they alter their organisations  so  that they can comply with the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* When the Opposition opened the debate on my motion that the Bill be read a second time,  Senator Poke  moved an amendment which, in effect, welcomed the extended scope for grants offered by the Bill; but also the honourable senator asked the Senate to accept, among other things, the Opposition view that the clauses of the Bill relating to credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> be redrafted to give savings with credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> complete and unconditional recognition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* Honourable senators will recall that the amendment was moved on Tuesday and that when the debate was resumed yesterday  Senator Poke  sought and obtained leave to amend his amendment, but only after he had heard the views on the admission of savings with credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> as enunciated by representatives of other parties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* This is entirely different from the original proposition that all savings with credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> be given complete and unconditional recognition for the purposes of the home savings grant scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* Why was it proposed by the Opposition only yesterday that credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> should perhaps - it does not seem very certain - be required to make loans for the acquisition of a home up to some minimum annual amount before savings with them may be approved? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* The first, as I mentioned, relates to the unconditional recognition of savings with credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* But the Government is faced with the fact that credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> make few, if any, large and long term loans for the acquisition of homes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* I wish to make it quite clear that the Government does not question the fact that a significant proportion of the loans made by some of the larger credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> is for purposes associated with housing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* However until recently a majority of the loans made by credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> for housing purposes were of relatively small amounts and for relatively short periods. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* However, a number of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> have recently been making larger loans for longer periods. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* Senator Little  said that he would like to see 5% or more of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> approved in the near future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* But I refer again to my second reading speech in which I showed that I agree with  Senator Little  in that I would like in the future to see credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> complying with the proposed conditions and becoming approved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* We initiated all of the ideas that are now contained in the amendment that is before the Senate as to the necessity for compromise particularly on the question of the stringent conditions applied to the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0)

* I should think that what trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> have secured for their members over the years is something which draftsmen could secure for themselves by much the same method of organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0)

* 1  am well aware of the submissions made by meat employees <span class="highlight">unions</span> in the past in regard to these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-13-0)

* It relates to the conditions under which individual credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> may seek and obtain approval for the purposes of the homes savings grant scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Its purpose is to help credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> while not losing sight of one of the basic objectives of the homes savings grant scheme, namely, to help to increase the volume of savings available for lending for home ownership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The attitude of the Government to the conditions for acceptance of the savings of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> set out in the amending Bill now before the Committee has not been entirely inflexible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I have listened with interest to arguments put on behalf of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> for an easing of the proposed requirement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* In particular I have been impressed by the thought that the objective of adding to the volume of savings for home ownership could in fact be advanced by setting a minimum amount for the prescribed housing loan which is perhaps more readily attainable by credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* In speaking on the second reading of the Bill I indicated that I had moved the amendment following representations which had been made to the Australian Labor Party by members of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* According to the Minister,  Senator Little  approached her and introduced representatives of some of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Apparently she received from the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> information which prompted an amendment which would be of assistance not only to the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> but also to the legislation which is brought forward by the Government on this occasion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I recall quite vividly that ever since the Homes Savings Grant Act was put on the statute book by this Government, we of the Labor Party have endeavoured to have the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> recognised for the purposes of this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Unfortunately, if the Bill now before the Committee is given effect to, even in the amended form as requested by the Minister, it will not bring within its provisions the number of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> which the Labor Party would desire to have participate under this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I should think that the Minister probably would have covered some of the ground for this proposal with representatives of the credit union and would have believed that if she deleted the words 'Seven thousand dollars' and inserted in lieu 'Five thousand dollars' this would have brought quite a number of other credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> within the provisions of the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The time factor is just as important to the credit union movement as a lesser prescribed amount because whilst it might be desirable in some cases to have a loan repayable over a period of 12 years, it is the wish of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> that their loans should not be repayable over a long period. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Surely to goodness in 1970 we have grown up sufficiently to try to bring in legislation which will benefit the great number of people who will be able to participate in the scheme under this legislation and  also benefit members of the various credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* But to move quickly to the matter before the Senate, the Government has in this clause realised that the original legislation was restrictive and excluded practically all credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia from the scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Reducing the amount of a prescribed housing loan from  $7,000  to  $5,000  is an improvement, but it sti!l excludes many credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> which exist under State legislation, lt excludes them not by reason of the amount only but by reason of ability and depth of finance, lt excludes many of the very small credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, lt must be appreciated that it is the small credit union which forms the backbone of the credit union movement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I believe that the Government has not really appreciated the amount of work which these small credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> do and the amount of assistance which they provide. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> often lend  $1,000  or  $2,000  in order to allow somebody to clear a mortgage on a block of land so that the title of the land is free and a house can be erected on it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* But there is another reason why credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> want the amount of the prescribed housing loan reduced and a shorter term provided for repayment of the loan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The shorter the term for which credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> can lend, the better it is for the members of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> because money becomes available for lending to other members within the group. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Why does not the Government accept the tremendous amount of work that credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, especially the smaller ones, are doing and reduce the amount of the prescribed housing loan to  $3,000? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I appeal to those who support, in principle, the reduction in the amount of the prescribed housing loan  from 7,000 to $5,000 to consider reducing it further to $3,000 in order to assist the small credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I will give  Senator Devitt  an explanation concerning the repayment period, because it is quite clear to me now that the Australian Labor Party has always been a long way behind in understanding what the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> want and, in effect, what the Democratic Labor Party has been proposing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Now the Australian Labor Party is prosecuting something on which the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> have had a full explanation and which they no longer require. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Of course, this legislation does not have only one purpose in mind, that of allowing credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to participate in the lending of homes savings finance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* That is why credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> are embodied in the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* If the honourable senator gets a list of the registered credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> he will find some with as few as 9 members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The point I am really making is that if the amendment which was moved in another place had been accepted it would virtually have meant that all credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> were in, irrespective of the amount of money or the number of members in them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* After 2 speakers from the Labor Party had made contributions to the debate - and neither of them mentioned the areas to which I directed the whole of my attention in my speech -  Senator Poke  then sought leave to amend his amendment, to introduce the very question which I have been discussing in order to try to obtain some benefit for people in credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I am one of those who, recognising the good things that are in the legislation, do not want to see it delayed further by futile political manoeuvres which may add to the political aggrandisement of a party when it talks to the people, or when it tries to sustain a case, but which will do nothing practical to get for people in credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> the very things that they want. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> now have a knowledge that none of us had before. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* We should make sure that we do not run away with the idea that this legislation is only for the benefit of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, like cooperative housing societies - wonderful is they are and no matter how much I support them - exist only to serve and function in the interests of the borrower. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The interpretation we now have of this clause seems to be acceptable to the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, if not to the Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* If the Labor Party is not up to date with its information from the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, I suggest that it is no worse off than it was the other night when it lagged a long way behind everybody else with its information. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* In their amendment, Labor senators have not considered the practical effects on the interests of the little people that they want to represent - not the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> as such but the people who make the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the ones who put their money into the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The very policy of the Government has made it necessary for the establishment of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the banding together of people to save together to be able to assist one another to take advantage of finance which is available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* If the Government did know, it would do everything possible to assist credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, rather than hinder them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The other portion which requires that credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> lend a minimum of $50,000 in home lending is to be considered later. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Here is another imposition which makes it patently impossible for the credit union movement, or the bulk of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, to take advantage of this scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* But again I refer, when considering this, to what might reasonably be done to permit savings with credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to be acceptable under the Homes Savings Grant Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The Government already makes some concessions to the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> in that the amount of $5,000 which I have moved tonight and to which objection is being taken by the Opposition is rather below the norm for maximum loans available from the major institutional lenders. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* At the present time when people are saving with credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> the Minister does a disservice to them by insisting that young people withdraw their savings from credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to put them into a recognised establishment for the purpose of qualifying for a grant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The condition that the Minister imposes on credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>  -  I think it is legitimate - is that they must subscribe a certain amount of their income to home loans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The obvious reason why not less than 15% of the total amount lent by the credit union to its members during each subsequent financial year will be lent by way of prescribed housing loans is that this will cover those credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> which are perhaps very large and where the $50,000 will not amount to that proportion of their lending for a particular year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I think  Senator Cavanagh  would realise, when he understands that there are some credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> which can lend more than $50,000, that the clauses are there for the sole purpose of seeing that the bigger credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> lend still more for prescribed housing loans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I am prepared to admit that the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> are a specific type of organisation, and they are prepared to admit that if they want to enter the field of housing they will have to change some of the things which have stood them in good stead in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* It would make money available for housing because the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> have to lend at least$50,000 a year by way of housing loans and, if they are bigger organisations, 20% of their lending must be by way of housing loans, irrespective of the conditions of those loans.

* I advise the Committee that representatives of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> suggested to the Labor Party that it would be in the interests of both the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> and persons seeking loans covered by the Homes Savings Grant Act to delete the limit of $50,000 to enable credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to advance a certain amount of money in bridging finance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I may be wrong because I am not an authority on credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, but I have had discussions with a number of representatives of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Tasmania who have told me, when we have discussed this type of legislation, that it was their opinion that there was not a credit union in Tasmania which would be able to qualify under the conditions laid down in this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I suggest that the Government should appreciate the participation of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> in this scheme and the benefits which may flow, not only to the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> themselves but also to the members because the office bearers and employees of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> are interested only in giving their members service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* If the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> are big enough to do that they will probably reach the 15% proposed in &gt; the clause and automatically would have the amount necessary for prescribed housing loans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The Government has shown its good faith in reducing the original amount of the prescribed housing loan from $7,000 to $5,000, which, according to the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, was the biggest bar to their participation in the scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* It is for this reason, 1 believe, that credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be fairly asked to understand the scheme's objectives, which have been discussed tonight. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> are asked to contribute to the scheme by making loans available for housing, lt is also reasonable to ask the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span>, if they are willing to contribute to the scheme's objectives, to do so in a practical way. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* The  $50,000  barrier - and I call it a barrier - which has been placed on credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> is not a condition that is imposed for  1  year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* But it must be realised that credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> must maintain this rate for,  1, 2,  3, 4 or  5  years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* I say again that the Government's action, together with that of the DLP, denies justice to the small credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> that are providing a service to the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* We would be prepared to accept the proposition which was indicated in passing by  Senator Little,  that perhaps this clause ought to indicate that 15%  of the amount of money held by credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be channelled in the direction of housing or prescribed housing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* If this were done, having made credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> eligible to accept the savings of youngsters, the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> would grow rapidly to the stage at which they would be lending  $50,000  a year for housing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* But by imposing this  $50,000  barrier, it excludes the smaller credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> and, what is more, it prohibits them from ever reaching the position where they would be able to lend  $50,000  a year for housing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* By doing this  1  think we would show that we properly appreciate the role of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> in our society, and it would place no limitation on them, if you invest in a credit union you will find that its lending is directed in some means towards the home. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-53)

* Amongst those reasons was the fact that the existing penal clause provisions worked unfairly against the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, lt was said that the bans clauses, which are part of the operation of the existing penal clauses, could operate indefinitely with a wide application: that these bans clauses and the orders which were made when a bans clause was not observed could be made in relation to one set of circumstances when originally the bans clause was imposed with regard to another set of circumstances: and that the penal clauses provisions did nol allow the merits of matters lo be considered when actions under those provisions were being heard, lt was further urged that the use of these sanctions could have an exacerbating effect on a dispute and finally that contempt proceedings in conn were not an appropriate form of sanction.

 Mr Temporary Chairman, as has been stated in speeches by myself and by members of the Opposition and as has been long stated by the trade union movement, the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and by declarations of the Australian Labor Party we are opposed to section 109 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and we believe that this section should be repealed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74)

* I think it would be as well for me to point out to the Government at this late stage that not only has the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> rejected the imposition of the penal provisions but also the white collar organisations, namely the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and the High Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations, have recently joined forces with the ACTU.

* Honourable senators will find in the records that when  Sir Henry  was with the Department of Labour and National Service in 1967 he warned the Government that the white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span> were becoming restive and that there would be serious difficulties because those <span class="highlight">unions</span> knew that they were going to face the same consequences as the blue collar workers.

              Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> enforcing his views and the views of some of those who support

* The Public Service Arbitration Act currently does not provide for industrial situations; it provides merely for the lodging of claims by <span class="highlight">unions</span> or the lodging by managements or <span class="highlight">unions</span> of applications for variations of determinations.

* I think I should re-state very quickly the opinion of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Opposition, lt has been stated by the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  and in the other place that proposed section 12e, which applies to a compulsory conference, is the same as the provision contained in section 29 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37)

* Further to the question just addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service by  Senator Cavanagh  I ask the same Minister: Is it not a fact that the legislation under which the rank and file of a trade union can be financially assisted in an endeavour to assert their rights was passed by the Chifley Government in the commendable belief that members of the rank and file of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> are entitled to have their ordinary rights in a union preserved?

* If there is provision for interference which is contrary to what was slated in the International Labour Organisation conventions and contrary to what has been set out as to what ought to be the rights of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, if we are to have judicial decisions which interfere drastically with the affairs of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and which allow no appeal to anybody, and if we are to have an amount of interference by administrative bodies such as we have in this Act and especially in the amendments which are being proposed by the Government, does anyone think it will stop there?

* May I take the trouble, because the matter on which we are differing here regarding the very fundamental of the nature of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which are registered organisations under the Act is so important, to read from the judgment of the High Court in the famous case of Williams and Hursey, one of the great cases in industrial law, well known, because of the facts of the case, at least to the members of this Senate, lt is reported in 33 Australian Law Journal Reports and also in the Commonwealth Law Reports.

* One of the great trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia - the Amalgamated Engineering Union - had links with its counterpart in Britain, and one of the reasons for the separation of those 2 bodies was the enormous interference in the affairs of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia.

* If we examine the composition of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, I think it must be conceded that any trade union organisation and particularly the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, that has been able to achieve any gains for its membership from that august body must have produced  strong arguments to convince it of the justice of union claims.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0)

* Consequently, when attempts were made to amalgamate and form bigger <span class="highlight">unions</span> and they failed, the Labor movement had to be satisfied with lesser confederations such as the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Officers and the Trades and Labour Councils in the respective States.

* The drafting of the provision in the original Act which provided that certain conduct in the nature of dismissing or threatening employees because of their being members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> or of their intending to be members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> was seriously defective.

* I ask the Minister whether, at the same time as he puts to the Minister for Labour and National Service the consideration of the statement by the national  president  of the metal trades employers' organisation, he will take note of  Mr Morgan's  statement that a failure to meet the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will aggravate industrial relations and be used to justify strikes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-6-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-8-0)

* I remind the Senate that only a few weeks ago we were discussing similarly restrictive arbitration legislation which was designed to prevent the Public Service <span class="highlight">unions</span> from becoming too active in seeking wage increases for their members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* Recently the 6 Public Service <span class="highlight">unions</span> had applications before the Public Service Arbitrator,  Mr Chambers,  seeking what they claimed to be reasonable salary increases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* The Commonwealth Government opposed those applications and made an offer to the <span class="highlight">unions</span> which was small by comparison with the claim. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* I include parliamentarians in the comparison because it at least gives us a chance to compare the level of our salaries with those of a section of the Public Service whose salaries are adjusted at the same time as legislation is introduced to impose more restrictions on the freedom of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and organisations to make collective agreements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* Mr Clyde  Cameron did not pursue the matter because he received a pretty emphatic repudiation from  Mr Linehan  on behalf of the white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span>, because implicit in  Mr Cameron's  attitude is a rejection by the Labor Party of the claims of white collar workers, and it shows a prejudice which I regret to see.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* What would be wrong in the Government convening an objective meeting of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the employers, the white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span> and, if you like, representatives of the State governments to try to find out precisely where we are going in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* We do not agree with the proposed legislation, but especially at this stage we are pointing to what  Senator Turnbull  states to be the hypocrisy of the Government in providing for one classification an increase of $4,400 a year, or $84 a week, with great retrospectivity, while at the same time bringing in a Bill to stop trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> settling their wage claims in concert with the employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* I personally do not know of them but at this moment there may be certain such <span class="highlight">unions</span> or groups of <span class="highlight">unions</span> which are on the verge of making application for amalgamation under the old law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33)

* The Attorney-General is telling us that if there is anything like that on foot, if any <span class="highlight">unions</span> are on the verge of amalgamating under the old law, that is something which has to be stopped at all costs, now, today.

* The legislation is bad enough but this proposal relating to retrospectivity will affect negotiations that <span class="highlight">unions</span> have been engaged in for some time - negotiations for one purpose only, namely, to ensure that all members of the respective <span class="highlight">unions</span> will be protected.

* I do not want to recapitulate the situations that confront some of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> that were mentioned by the Attorney-General and other speakers; I simply want to give another illustration of why, in my opinion, the Government would be fully justified in spending the entire recess in conference with affected <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39)

* As I interpret the legislation in relation to overtures for amalgamation between the canvas workers and the Australian Railways Union, the Government will be prepared to assist and subsidise the <span class="highlight">unions</span> only if they synchronise the amalgamation ballot with their triennial elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39)

* If honourable senators look at the balance sheet of the average trade union today they will find that if the <span class="highlight">unions</span> are forced to conduct an additional ballot in this situation they will be in  a  really difficult financial position.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39)

* We have been told on many occasions how sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act can be used to punish the <span class="highlight">unions</span> heavily by imposing a fine of Si, 000, and $500 a day for every repetition of an offence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39)

* The Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  in the statement he made in December 1971 when he indicated the intention of the Government to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, said that several <span class="highlight">unions</span> had not paid fines totalling $37,950. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39)

* We had the upheaval around the metal trades award towards the end of 1968 which led to the spate of strikes in 1969, in which the employers raced to the Commonwealth Industrial Court in case after case under old sections 109 and 111  -  the contempt powers - 'and automatically had fines imposed on the <span class="highlight">unions</span> with costs added. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39)

* I can only conclude, as I said before, that the purpose of this section is not to ensure industrial peace; it is to aggravate industrial relations in the hope that this Government can emerge before the electors as the champion of law and order, as the custodian of all the righteousness of the community and as the people who come in and clear up the chaos which has been caused by these wicked <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* The proposed new sub-section 2 of section 39 reflects again the intention of the Government to tie down as rigidly as possible every action which might be taken by the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in an attempt to obtain decent awards and agreements in order to match the escalation of inflation and prices.

*  Before we leave this group of clauses I should like to record the Australian Labor Party's opposition to clause 19, which is the clause which introduces provisions for the conduct of secret ballots in <span class="highlight">unions</span> when an industrial dispute occurs or is threatening. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#debate-20)

* But I take the view that we have high living standards in this country and that they have been secured in the past by sensible use of our arbitration system, by strong <span class="highlight">unions</span> acting responsibly and by employer organisations which have known when to respond and on occasion when not to respond. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#debate-20)

* What I want to point out is that it is inescapable that the whole policy of Labor has been developed to point up its purpose - that if it were to attain government it would be a government dominated by <span class="highlight">unions</span> for the purpose of <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45)

* If the Government says that it did not start out to do this, is it so pusillanimous and has it so abdicated its responsibilities that it would stand by and see the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> of this country breach in a major way diplomatic relations in terms of trade and communications and take no action?

* It should, here and now, set about calling a conference of Federal and State governments, industry and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* Despite the boasting of the Labor Party prior to the election that it could handle the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, industrial unrest is at an all time high. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* Then  Mr Hawke  came up to see him and the very next day the Prime Minister announced that he would be moving legislation for a referendum to control prices, and he gave the Australian Parliament and the people of Australia an assurance from  Mr Hawke  that if these controls were successful the <span class="highlight">unions</span> would exercise wage restraint. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* But  Mr Hawke  soon dismissed this, because  Mr Hawke  said he had given no such assurance, and, in a moment of sarcasm, he said he could no more control the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> than the Prime Minister could control his Caucus. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* That is interesting- of the union movement that, if price control proved effective, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> would act voluntarily to restrain or moderate wage demands. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* So here we have the situation in which a socalled Prime Minister gave an assurance to the Parliament that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> would cooperatean assurance given at the same time by the  President  of the ACTU, who is also the  President  of the Labor Party- and the next day having to eat humble pie and crawl.

* He suggested also that a prices referendum could be effective because he had the assurance of the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, one Robert Hawke, that if he exercised compulsory price control the ACTU would cooperate in a voluntary wage restraint.

* But if the Government behaves in a certain way towards the 2 Bills that were passed in this Senate with our support only a week ago and suddenly goes soft, at the behest of the left wing <span class="highlight">unions</span>, and suggests that incomes have nothing whatsoever to do with wages, nobody could estimate what the costs of meat inspections will be in 3 years.

* Now that the trade union movement, as represented by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, has indicated its hostility to the incomes part of the proposed prices-incomes referendum, has the Government, considering the total interdependence of prices and incomes, decided to abandon the referendum? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-9-0)

* I refer to the reported statement by  Mr Hawke-  I do not know whether he made it in his capacity as  President  of the Australian Labor Party or  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>- that although the Labor Party will not be able officially to campaign against the incomes referendum, individual members of the Labor Party who are unionists will be free to do so- Does this mean that Government members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives who happen to be unionists will be free to campaign against the incomes referendum? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-28-0)

* As we then said, it was sectional legislation reflecting submission by this Government to the influence and power of the strong militant <span class="highlight">unions</span> of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* The way in which that case was made out was by demonstrating the way in which the Australian Labor Party constitutionally is structured and how in so many ways many members of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament are beholden to members of <span class="highlight">unions</span>, not so much that they submit to the power and direction of <span class="highlight">unions</span>, but they are subject to the influence of <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* It was calculated to allow <span class="highlight">unions</span> to act with substantial immunity from the consequences of their actions, and to be free to impose bans, strikes and boycotts and to exert intimidation and duress without any legislative deterrent or penalty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* In fact, <span class="highlight">unions</span> were made immune from the law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* Under the Bill <span class="highlight">unions</span> were to be placed above the law by being granted immunity from the consequences of actions for which other individuals, if they broke the law, would be liable for penalty under the law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* However, it was an approach which clearly meant that <span class="highlight">unions</span> in terms of full employment, and employers in less affluent times, could use all the force of intimidation and duress- their blunt, stark naked economic power- to impose conditions on the opposite party which that power enabled them to enforce. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* Notwithstanding the view put forward last NovemberDecember that a Labor Government could be expected to improve industrial relations because, after all, a Labor Government would know the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the unionists better than a Liberal-Country Party Government would, the record is precisely the opposite. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* At the moment major strikes that are producing near-chaos in certain areas of national life include those by technicians in charge of navigation and landing equipment at Sydney and Canberra Airports, by builders' labourers in Sydney, by mail officers at Sydney Mail Exchange, and by the power industry <span class="highlight">unions</span> in New South Wales.

* The Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when referring to <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the question of union amalgamation during his second reading speech on this Bill, which is recorded on page 659 of Hansard of 30 August, said: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0)

* But because of the way in which some of the regulations have been framed, which treat a branch as if it were something different from the organisation, and because of the complications which arose from the co-existence of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in the States- I think many honourable senators will be aware of the Moore v Doyle problem- there has arisen the feeling that in some way the branches are different entities or on a different level or are to be treated differently from what is the real legal position, that is, that officers, whether they are of a branch or at the federal level, are all officers of the organisation.

* What, for example, if a small union in a large factory in which there are other <span class="highlight">unions</span> which have members performing much the same work, is able to persuade an employer to give, say, a 100 per cent wage increase or 7 weeks annual leave or a 30-hour week and that agreement then comes up for approval- for certification.

* Over the years, in cases in which there would have been complete agreement between an employer and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> or the employees, we find that there has been an inability on the part of a commissioner to certify an agreement because it would not have been in the public interest.

* Certainly, any kind of violence, and especially murder, would be disapproved of not only by everyone here but also by the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> of Australia which have a reputation of being free of the kind of violence and intimidation which has sometimes occurred in the United States when there has been infiltration from outside.

* Because the monopoly maritime <span class="highlight">unions</span> sought to arrogate to themselves the monopoly in relation to New Zealand trade that they have long exercised with regard to the Australian coastal trade, they picketed the ship and prohibited her from unloading any of the Mazda cars in Hobart unless she returned to Adelaide, delivered the Chryslers back to the Adelaide port and proceeded on.

* As I had occasion to remark when discussing this Bill on a previous occasion, we have some grounds for hoping, on reading the speeches in the other place of  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, that this moderate approach is beginning to take root among the Opposition and that it is beginning io dawn on it that union bashing and vilification and wild frenzied talk about anything to do with <span class="highlight">unions</span> may be unproductive.

* I can well remember the time of the one man bus dispute in Melbourne when, after penalties had been imposed by the Industrial Court, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, first by a commissioner and then by the Full Bench, took off the ban on strikes and limitations of work because it took the view that, in the circumstances, it was unjust that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be penalised.

* It is a cause of concern for many <span class="highlight">unions</span> that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is seen by Opposition senators as a means of, in some ways, providing unionists with facilities or, in other ways, directing how they will conduct their affairs within the structure of the union itself.

* The number of registered trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia at the moment is approximately three hundred. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* If one thinks of the position of one-third of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> of Australia with membership of 5,000 or less, one realises it is almost impossible to manage a union of that size in today's circumstances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* Another example of what the Government is concerned about is that there are 28 <span class="highlight">unions</span> operating in the Post Office in Australia and 26 <span class="highlight">unions</span> operating in Trans-Australia Airlines.

* I think it was in 1918 that  Mr Justice  Higgins, the first  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, made the comment in the waterside workers' case that 'competition for membership between <span class="highlight">unions</span> is disastrous to industrial peace'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* One of the great tragedies of the Opposition, of course- plenty of criticism is made of the Government in this regard- is that its members just do not understand the situation which exists in many trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* There are many <span class="highlight">unions</span> which at this time desire to amalgamate, and they have been prevented from doing so because of the requirements of the present legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* As I have said before, both <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers operating in the field of industrial relations recognise the necessity for these sorts of proposals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* I think it is not unfair to say that it goes something like this: 'Really, in our society, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> cause a lot of trouble and for that reason it is desirable that they do not become too big, because if they become bigger they will cause more trouble, and we on the Opposition benches know that <span class="highlight">unions</span> are manipulated by malevolent men who run the <span class="highlight">unions</span> from the committee of management level and tell the unfortunate slave members what they have to do'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* I do not dissent from the fact that there may be a slight grain of truth in that proposition; but what I am trying to put to the Senate is that that is a simplistic view of the way trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> operate and it is a simplistic view of the way the conciliation and arbitration legislation operates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* Those who are most aware of what is desirable and what is rational are employers engaged in the particular industries and the best informed members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> engaged in those industries, who are, of course, the members of the committees of management. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* I think we in this country have to be very careful that we do not facilitate here or elsewhere legislation which rushes us into a situation of some sort of giant corporate state in which the corporations of labour and the corporations of capital clash in a sort of neanderthal giant manner to the exclusion, perhaps, of the public interest and to the exclusion, perhaps, of smaller business interests and smaller <span class="highlight">unions</span> in the community, because there are certain logical arrangements of society which are not consistent with that view of a giant corporate state.

* I have not known of any <span class="highlight">unions</span> in recent times which have proposed amalgamation with other <span class="highlight">unions</span> and which have not as a first step gone to the Industrial Registrar to seek his advice about the steps which had to be taken and about the way in which any ballots in relation to those amalgamations should be conducted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* If <span class="highlight">unions</span> do not conduct secret ballots aggrieved members can go to the Industrial Registrar and complain about the matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* The only thing different about our amalgamation proposals is simply that as policy matters are to be considered and negotiations are required with employers in industry and with other <span class="highlight">unions</span>, it is very appropriately a matter which in all instances should be dealt with by the committee of management of a union unless there is so much concern about it in the union that its members want to invoke the safeguard provisions which require a ballot to be conducted by the Industrial Registrar.

* It is said that <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be put in a different position from other voluntary associations in our society because of some concern of  Senator Greenwood's,  which I share, that the activities of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> appear to affect the public interest from time to time in various ways. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* We say that the Opposition, by the proposed amendment to the provisions for determining the result of a ballot, is seeking to insert in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act conditions in relation to the administration of the internal affairs of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which are not imposed on anybody else in our society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* The philosophical view behind that, as I understand it, is either that it is desirable to keep <span class="highlight">unions</span> weak or that <span class="highlight">unions</span> are more prey to malevolent men than is any other corporate organisation in our society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* In this legislation there is still a greater degree of regulation of the internal affairs of <span class="highlight">unions</span> which desire to amalgamate than there is of the affairs of other bodies in society which attempt to fuse their activities or amalgamate in one form or another. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* One cannot legislate to abolish apathy in the affairs of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, if that exists, as it does from time to time, as in other organisations or to compel trade unionists to take part in the affairs of the union unless the members are interested in those matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* It is sought anxiously by <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers in the community so that the industrial relations system can at least have one area of conflict substantially reduced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* It cannot be considered a step forward when, in fact, a simply majority of perhaps 10 per cent of people involved can direct the course of their union and other <span class="highlight">unions</span> in search of amalgamation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0)

* When considering increasing the number of amalgamations we should recognise the situation that amalgamations in the past have been mainly large <span class="highlight">unions</span> joining other large <span class="highlight">unions</span> and in fact there has not been pressure to remove smaller <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* <span class="highlight">Unions</span> would be wise to counter this trend by positive improvements of organisation and communication; and employers would be wise to facilitate such improvements instead of trying to keep the <span class="highlight">unions</span> away from their employees as they have usually done in the past.

* Whilst totally agreeing, and I wish to emphasise this, on the importance of the essential role played by the trade union movement in the operation of the mixed economy which we enjoyed until the change of Government but which we now find is creating very considerable problems, I must say that it is about time that we as a community asked: What is the role of the trade union movement in Australia, how far does its proper role extend into the economy and into society, and are there structural changes which are desirable in relation to the <span class="highlight">unions</span>?

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0)

* The Australian Government and the Australian Labor Party have done a great deal for trade unionism in this country.There is no doubt that from time to time some <span class="highlight">unions</span> may not agree with everything that the Government has done, but it has been remarkable how over the whole of this century the great bulk of the trade union movement has stuck solidly with the Australian Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0)

* Except for the one organisation which has members employed by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, the other <span class="highlight">unions</span> which have members employed by the PostmasterGeneral's Department have supported the proposal to form the Post Office into a commission because the <span class="highlight">unions</span> believe that is the only way in which their problems can be solved reasonably and within a reasonable time.

* Regarding my own activities in this connection, I have been able to arrange regular consultations between management and <span class="highlight">unions</span> where required, by having members of my own ministerial staff doing extra jobs to see that there would be necessary short-circuits where head-on clashes might eventuate.

* Then, when Tasmania was bedevilled by navigational difficulties, inequalities, and pressures from <span class="highlight">unions</span> and others way back in 1920, it is not surprising to find that quite a considerable body of opinion on the royal commission of 1929, ably assisted by the late Chief Justice Nicholas, Chief Justice in Equity in New South Wales, when he was equity counsel at the Bar of Sydney, propounded a view in favour of the Inter-State Commission and mentioned amongst ot her things the effect of the Navigation Act on various States as an appropriate subject of inquiry, very pertinent to the interests which I am sent here to represent, namely, Tasmania in particular and her navigational difficulties.

* You,  Mr President,  particularly, and I would be concerned with the trade between Tasmania and the mainland, which has been bedevilled by the fact that there is a divided jurisdiction, whereby the Arbitration Court, paralysed, is unable to force <span class="highlight">unions</span> to carry on proper services, and the poor little Tasmanian Government has to go down on its knees to the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and beseech from them a special dispensation in this strike of Tasmanian services.

* Then we come to the situation where, after a long proclamation of policy, the Labor Government has taken  Vh  years to produce this Bill; and perhaps that betokens that there has been a bit of to-ing and fro-ing and struggle with <span class="highlight">unions</span> that has been completely in vain for the purpose of doing anything other than direct the Inter-State Commission to disestablish the capital side of trade and commerce. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0)

* It seems to me that anyone who asserts that they are a constitutional exercise of power pursuant to section 10 1 of the Constitution or pursuant to any other head of power is simply using the vehicle of this Inter-State Commission to pursue a campaign against <span class="highlight">unions</span> for party political propaganda purposes.

* If this Bill is to be made a medium of attacks on <span class="highlight">unions</span> and unionists and if the only purpose of Opposition amendmentswe have had only one foreshadowed tonight- is to take advantage of this Bill to attack <span class="highlight">unions</span> and to attack <span class="highlight">unions</span> in particular in relation to Tasmania, I suggest that the Opposition is unworthily using an extremely important piece of legislation to pursue party political advantage.

* Coming up to date, perhaps too rapidly for the Minister, the work published under the caption 'Collective Bargaining in Industrial Market Economies' by the International Labor Organisation, Geneva, in 1974, at page 177, says that it was remarked that <span class="highlight">unions</span> play a vital part in the arbitration system which would be impossible to operate if it had to deal with individual workers.

* If it makes  Senator Scott  feel happier, I personally disapprove of that sort of action by industrial <span class="highlight">unions</span>, just as I disapprove of the use of political-cum-economic muscle by vested interests in the dairy industry and by certain margarine manufacturers to deny Australian housewives and other consumers over the last 25 years open access to margarine supplies.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0)

* We are not, of course, in any position to forbid the <span class="highlight">unions</span> from suggesting that a 2.9 per cent increase or any other figure should be taken into account as the correct indexation figure in the hearing commencing before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission today, any more than we can forbid an employers federation from claiming that nothing should be passed on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-19-0)

 - Mr Deputy President, when this matter first became the subject of public debate I was rather surprised to hear  Senator Greenwood  in particular and the Opposition generally arguing in defence of a senior member of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>- that is the trade union movementnamely,  Mr Souter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0)

* We can see from that that assertions that all culpability lay with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> or certain individuals in the ACTU could not be reasonably sustained. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0)

* It is apparent that this motion is aimed essentially at the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>,  Mr Hawke,  who is the one person outside the Government whom the Opposition most fears; fears because of his forthrightness; fears because of the manner in which he exposes some of the capitalistic deals that have been a disgrace to this country; fears because when, from the cover of privilege of Parliament, accusations are made against him he answers like an honest man in a ringing voice and says: 'Repeat that outside and you will be sued '; and fears, fourthly, because he has a very good track record in defamation proceedings.

* In this instance a man in my State who has devoted himself honestly to the work of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and who, in concert with others, is a director, of an enterprise finds that as a result of an inquiry he is the one who is picked out and is left by his other directors to take the full burden of whatever criticism is made, criticism which in actual fact might wreck the whole career of  Mr Souter.

* As honourable senators know, I told  Mr Justice  Hope at my in camera interview with him that I believed in the Canadian system of reviewing citizenship rejections whereby in a 9-man panel any five members constitute an appeals board, one-third of the members are legal people and another third are a blending of representatives of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, manufacturers and other kindred groups.

* I refer to the reason given by the Treasurer for leaking Budget details to  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, namely, to enable  Mr Hawke  to make a considered comment on Budget night. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-16-0)

* Generally speaking, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> are failing to communicate effectively with non-English speaking migrant workers and cater to their needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-24-0)

* There are some trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which demonstrate and have demonstrated over many years that basic representation of the rank and file worker, but no one can say that where there is a union membership of something like 170 000 people and only -2000 of them vote the people elected by those 2000 in any way represent the 170 000.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-34-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0)

* As to the future, I think we all realise that in any industry, particularly where manual operations occur, it has never been the desire of the Waterside Workers Federation or of any of the other <span class="highlight">unions</span> associated with it to object to labour saving devices. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0)

* We are told, if the grapevine is to be believed, that this year it will notch up a loss of $ 15m or in excess of that amount and, further, that $6m of that loss was incurred through disputes by <span class="highlight">unions</span> which in the waterfront and on the sea-going vessels have a monopoly situation enabling them to hold up shipping.

* The Commission went on to say that the system is contrary to the best interests of the Australian community, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their members generally and to particular <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0)

* Now that the Parliament will be rising at the end of this week, the Government has raised with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> the desirability of the talks being conducted on successive days rather than being split over the week. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0)

* As honourable senators will know, it is already the practice to provide for officially conducted elections at Government expense- provisions which, I might add, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> indicated, when they saw the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on 5 May, had their support. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0)

* At the same time the Government has appreciated the real concern expressed by the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and has sought to meet their objections, consistent with its policy objectives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0)

* However, in the light of the views which are expressed, particularly by the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, it has opted for a maximum term of 4 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0)

* Of course, what is happening is that certain of the radical <span class="highlight">unions</span> are just attaching themselves to a slogan for their own purposes which have nothing to do with Medibank and which have nothing to do with the interests of the Australian people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0)

 Senator Baume wonders why the <span class="highlight">unions</span> are taking up the cause of Medibank. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0)

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> know that that very large proportion of people in the community welcomed Medibank, welcomed its efficiency and economy and welcomed the fact that it took the terror out of being ill and took the terror out of having to pay excessive private health insurance funds, and because they care for their members and because they know that 74 per cent of the people of Australia want Medibank retained they are going in to bat for it.

* I recall that there was an enormous outburst of outrage pseudo morality, particularly in certain sections of the media and especially that section of the media controlled by Rupert Murdoch, when  Mr Jack  Egerton, a VicePresident of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and  President  of the Queensland Branch of the Labor Party, was appointed to the same position.

* So not only is it going to make it a moral and social obligation but also a legal obligation on organisations such as trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-64)

* One can go right back to the period after the Second World War and follow through the basic wage cases, the margins cases and the national wage cases which took the place of basic wage cases, and one will find that in every one ofthe decisions in those cases the Commission has been asked by the Government and by the parties, be they employers or <span class="highlight">unions</span>, to have regard to the state of the economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* There is not one tittle of evidence in the Minister's second reading speech to indicate that members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> or employer organisations do not have a real opportunity to choose now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I agree that if we want to go back to the late 1 940s or even the early 1950s we will find that there was substantial evidence to indicate that members of certain <span class="highlight">unions</span> may have been subject to intimidation by one side or another, but there is no evidence in the Minister's second reading speech or in the debate in the House of Representatives or in any other allegations to indicate that there has been intimidation and so on in the conduct of union ballots. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* The Government hopes that the introduction of what it calls secret ballot legislation will have the result of involving members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> much more in the conduct of ballots, and that the consequences of that will be that certain union officials who may be unpalatable to the Government will be so regarded also by members of their <span class="highlight">unions</span> and there will be a consequent change in the composition of the boards of management and the officials of <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is desired that the present position should be replaced by a position in which ballot papers will be forwarded to all members of <span class="highlight">unions</span>, and a secret postal ballot will take place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is my view that some <span class="highlight">unions</span> will welcome this legislation and find it convenient because it is accompanied by the undertaking that the Government will pay the costs of such ballots if they are conducted by the Industrial Registrar or the Commonwealth Electoral Office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* Many <span class="highlight">unions</span> are already taking advantage of those provisions as they exist in the present Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* The point we seek to make about the legislation is that it seems to us and to some <span class="highlight">unions</span> to be an unwarranted interference in the affairs of the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* As I have said, nonetheless we do not think that, insofar as most <span class="highlight">unions</span> are concerned, the provisions will be particularly onerous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span>, in fact, suggested 5 years and the Government 3 years; and the compromise was 4 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* The Court has said, in a confusing variety of decisions, that the term of office of officials in some <span class="highlight">unions</span> is appropriately 3 or 4 years and in others 5 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I believe that in the case of some <span class="highlight">unions</span> the Court has said 6 years, but that may not be a correct recollection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I think there is an advantage for <span class="highlight">unions</span> in having a fixed term prescribed by the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It gives evidence of a great measure of discussion that has already taken place between the Government, the employers and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* Ballots may be controlled by the Commonwealth Electoral Office, in which case there would be no charge on the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I understand that last year the Australian Railways Union conducted a ballot at a charge to itself- in other words, to its members- of some $40,000-odd, and of course that union is not one of the really big <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I understand that in some <span class="highlight">unions</span> and in some circumstances that as much as 90 per cent to 95 per cent of union membership can be found in three or four specific areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It may well be that in certain circumstances referable to the far flung membership of <span class="highlight">unions</span> the operation of a collegiate system on a regional or State basis would succeed in giving truer representation across the board. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is merely stating in so many words that <span class="highlight">unions</span> must find a way of achieving for their total membership the right actively to elect their executives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is claiming that it does not intend to proclaim the legislation other than minor provisions relating to the appointment of an additional judge to the Commonwealth Industrial Court until it has had a chance to hold discussions with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* So it appears that the Government is not genuine in its attempt to improve industrial relations but is introducing this legislation only to provoke the <span class="highlight">unions</span> into confrontation so that later on when the Government finds its economic measures are failing to get results it will be able to blame the trade union movement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is quite obvious that the Government will enter into discussions with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> with a closed mind, otherwise it would have delayed the legislation until after the discussions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I maintain where there is an improvement in the number of days lost through industrial disputes, for whatever reason, the Government should not introduce legislation which will only provoke the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* They will also encourage the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to bypass the Commission and not to have any agreements certified. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* There is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will take the course of action which they think necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* Again the Commission rejected the Government's submission and granted the applicant, the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, the full 3.2 per cent increase it sought. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* The Government will try to put the blame on the <span class="highlight">unions</span> as an excuse for not having a formula that will reduce inflation and also reduce unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> are very perturbed that this legislation is only a gimmick. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It is only the officials of <span class="highlight">unions</span> who have been elected by some devious means through the rules of their organisations and who do not carry out the objectives of their members and look after the welfare of those members who have anything to hide, who have any need to worry and who need to seek protection from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to retain their jobs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* As  Senator Button  mentioned here tonight, several applications have been made to the Commonwealth Industrial Court regarding the tenure of office of elected officials of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* Yet, in this legislation although we are being asked to concede the rights of organisations to fix their rules and the terms of office of their officials and to conduct their own ballots, whether by postal ballot or secret ballot- which is the way in which most <span class="highlight">unions</span> do conduct their ballots- we are also being asked to agree that no union should in the future be able to provide in its rules for a term of office for its officials of more than 4 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I would like to know what right the Commonwealth Government has to interfere in the internal affairs ofthe trade union movement by enforcing a term of office of 4 years on quite a number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> which at present provide for a term of office of 5 years or 6 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* For this reason I fail to understand why the Government has included in this amendment to the legislation the provision that <span class="highlight">unions</span> can elect officers for only a 4-year term. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I can only assume that the Government has introduced this legislation because it wants to put it on the shelf and wait to see how the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> behaves during the next conference that it has with the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* Obviously the union ballots is related to the question of democracy in <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* When one considers the tremendous costs involved in union elections, it seems to me to be quite incomprehensible that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be disagreeing with our proposal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* I am not speaking on this matter with the experience that other people have, and I will be looking with great interest to the discussions on this matter that will take place between the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  in the next few months before 13 November. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* It seems to me that the introduction of any method by which machine politics can be kept out of trade union affairs must be to the advantage of the individual members of <span class="highlight">unions</span>, and if that is what we are seeking I would be in favour of it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* In regard to the collegiate system I make the general observation that it seems to me only reasonable that in order properly to obtain democracy in <span class="highlight">unions</span> there should be only one tier between the individual member of a union and the final election to Federal leadership.

* Also I believe that the members of the public are demanding in their own interests and in the interests of individual members of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> that we should have a situation where the Government can intervene in proceedings before the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and ask the Full Bench to take the question of public interest into account in making its decision.

* Despite this body of case law and the obvious preference of most <span class="highlight">unions</span>- I emphasise the words 'most <span class="highlight">unions</span>'for the federalist or collegiate system, the Act was changed to withdraw the right of registered organisations to choose their best method of selfgovernment and to force them to change their rules by the direct or centralist system within 3 years of the commencement of the 1973 Act.

* A union could expect some degree of success before the Court but it could well be influenced by other <span class="highlight">unions</span> not to ask a member ofthe Commission to make an award on a matter because the Act could be applied, with all its repercussions, against other <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* Whilst those who have not caused much trouble have a predominance in the ACTU, there is such complete disagreement on the part of <span class="highlight">unions</span> because they are fed up and lack faith in the Government that the Government will find it very difficult to achieve its aim. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0)

* The simple fact of the matter is that what the Government is seeking to do is to provide what must be regarded as essential in a democratic community, namely, an opportunity for full participation by members of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in what is a vital function- the election of their office bearers.

* Senator Cavanagh  intervenes and says that every union has them, but the illustrations and the evidence before the Government and the people of Australia is that in a very considerable number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> the participation of the electorate- the trade union rank and file- in the ballot is so minimal as to negate the whole idea of the secret ballot.

* 2) 1976 last evening I was drawing attention to the fact that it was immensely necessary that we establish a method of election of officers in the conciliation and arbitration system that permitted the greatest possible number of members of Australian <span class="highlight">unions</span> at the grass roots level to take a real part in the election of those people who are to negotiate for them.

* I shall not continue with these quotations, although I could continue for quite a long time as these promises were made so often; but I ask honourable senators to note that in the promises made by the Prime Minister and by  Mr Street  there is an emphasis on postal voting as being the essential element in introducing democracy into the <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* The point I hope I am making clearly- I think there was some confusion about this in the debate last night- is that by allowing for the collegiate system to be perpetuated the Government also is allowing <span class="highlight">unions</span> not to have postal ballots; that is, not to have the very system which the Government claimed was essential for democracy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is interesting that it comes up right at this time, because we are now at the end of the 3 years prescribed in the Cameron legislation of 1973, during which time all <span class="highlight">unions</span> would have to adopt the rank and file method of election. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

* At this time some <span class="highlight">unions</span>, including all National Civic Council controlled <span class="highlight">unions</span> such as the Federated Clerks Union and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, have not changed to the rank and file method. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

* I think it is perfectly reasonable for me and other members of the Opposition to place a very sinister interpretation on what the Government has done by developing amendments at the very moment when all <span class="highlight">unions</span>, particularly the NCC dominated <span class="highlight">unions</span>, would have had to transfer to the most democratic method of electing officials; that is, the rank and file method. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

* It seems reasonable to suggest that this demonstrates blatant prejudice by the Government in favour of the NCC <span class="highlight">unions</span>, although ironically some communist controlled <span class="highlight">unions</span> which still have the collegiate system will be able to maintain their leadership under the same provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

* To me it is crystal clear that this Government has 'done a deal' with the Santamaria/National Civic Council group and has 'sold out' thousands of Australian unionists who  saw, in the pre-election industrial promises of this Government, an opportunity to place their own acceptance or rejection on whom would be the Federal Officials of a number of Australian Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>.

* In answer to that claim I stress again that there was no consultation of peak <span class="highlight">unions</span> with regard to the specific amendments- in particular the amendment providing that office bearers shall not constitute more than 15 per cent of the members of the college to which I shall refer later- which were introduced during the debate in the other place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0)

* The defintion of 'office' is now extended to enable <span class="highlight">unions</span>, that is, management of unionsagain not the rank and file members of <span class="highlight">unions</span>- to appoint persons to undertake duties similar to those performed by an elected officer.

* In summary, I and other members of the Opposition, are opposing this legislation because it removes the right of the rank and file members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> to participate directly in ballots for their full time Federal officers because it enables minority factions at present in control of some <span class="highlight">unions</span> to retain control of those <span class="highlight">unions</span> against the wishes of the rank and file members, because the legislation was drawn up without proper consultation with the union movement, and because particularly the 15 per cent amendment was introduced with no consultation and is an erosion of the democratic rights of the trade union movement.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* I should simply like to say that the Government has broadly indicated its support for amalgamations which would lead to industry based <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* The mere fact of having fewer <span class="highlight">unions</span> and bigger <span class="highlight">unions</span> for their own sake is not necessarily by any means a solution to the problems in the trade union movement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* Senator Sibraa  mentioned the German Federation of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> which, I think, is commonly referred to as the GDB. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* The German movement had only 16 <span class="highlight">unions</span> covering a large number of members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* It certainly was not due solely, by any means, to the fact that there are so few trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Germany. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* So I think it must be clear now even to those Labor senators who seem determined to misunderstand or misrepresent the nature of this Bill which seeks to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that this Bill simply provides an alternative democratic method of electing the leadership of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* The reason for it is that there are a number of <span class="highlight">unions</span>- I think probably the most notable example is the Australian Workers Union- which have provision for a variable number of full time employees of the union for the time being but not permanent employees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* The Government believes, in accordance with the representations it has received from <span class="highlight">unions</span>, that it is quite unnecessary and in fact impractical to require such officials to be elected in the same way as the full time permanent officials are. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0)

* I ask: Does the Prime Minister's statement indicate that the representations from the South Australian Government and industry in South Australia are being rejected, or does the Government still have under consideration the proposals from the South Australian Government and/or the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> shipbuilding committee?

* Although the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations did not bother to tell the <span class="highlight">unions</span> most vitally concerned- the bulk of the Australian trade union movement- or to consult with them until the very week in which the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives, it is apparent that he had been in consultation with the Federal Secretary or council of the Federated Clerks Union, whose council was able to display before the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives knowledge not only of the Bill itself but also of the amendment which the Minister threw down on to the table one hour before he moved it some 3 weeks after the Bill was originally introduced.

* The Government's policy on this matter was enunciated by me on behalf of the Government in the debate last week on the Bill to provide for collegiate voting in union elections, but I reiterate that the policy in this area is to foster and encourage the formation of industry-based <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* For example, in the last 20 years the number of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> has been reduced by about 20 per cent, although this has occurred in part due to a process of amalgamation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-26-0)

* It is true that in the case of many <span class="highlight">unions</span> concerned in the Medibank strike and in strikes on other issues the decision to strike has been made autocratically by a union executive without reference to membership and a direction has been issued to membership to take strike action.

* If I may say so in passing, it is interesting, when one hears remarks about who is running the country and about the shocking malfeasances of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in organising demonstrations against policies of the present Government, to note that there was certainly no objection from members of the present Government when they were in Opposition to the use of policy holders' money by insurance companies and to the time that was taken by employees of insurance companies, which again was a burden on the policy holders of those companies and allegedly mutual life assurance societies, in demonstrations throughout Australia against the Labor Government which was then in office, having been twice democratically elected on a program of introducing legislation similar to that which we introduced.

* I predict- I hope I am proved wrong- that next year will see a further shattering of the consensus without which parliamentary democracy cannot be conducted, that is, that there will be a confrontation between this Government and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in an attempt to make the <span class="highlight">unions</span> bear the burden of the Government's errors.

* If this claim is correct, can it be construed that it is the Government's intention to use ASIO as part of its weaponry to enforce its policy of cracking down on outspoken members of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in an attempt to weaken the trade union movement?

* I suppose that if one had no humanitarian instincts, if one was out purely to make a fast buck and had a million dollars to expend, one would go to those countries where, because of the lack of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, because of the lack of some sort of organisation to protect workers, one can hire and fire for $3, $4, $5, $6 or $7 a week.

* In return for reduced working hours the <span class="highlight">unions</span> have negotiated a document and costed productivity package with Telecom within the guidelines set out by the Public Service Board last year, including existing service standards and output to be maintained; no significant increase in overtime; no increase in staff numbers; no significant increase in costs.

* Can the Minister say whether the present provisions of the conciliation and arbitration legislation are adequate to deal with demarcation disputes such as this between <span class="highlight">unions</span> and, if the legislation is not adequate, are there any amendments which the Government can make to it to provide for the speedy settlement of such disputes when they arise?

* I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to a question which I asked him on 23 February 1977 and to a further question on the same subject I asked on 22 March 1977 which related to assurances given by  Mr Street  and by  Mr Cameron  to <span class="highlight">unions</span> concerning amendments to rules.

* The other union, which is serviced by a very dedicated secretary,  Mr Les  Butler, would have no more than 1600 or 1800 people and it is obvious that in these times of financial demands on trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> those 1 600 or 1 800 people will receive better service through this amalgamation.

* The fact is that  Mr Hawke,  who can never quite make up his mind about whether he is  President  of the Australian Labor Party and therefore pushing a political line, or  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and pushing a union line, would not come to the party.

* Likewise, a central trade union organisation such as the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and State Labour Councils have had rules for the conduct and control of industrial disputes with their own internal disciplinary procedures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* Failure to uphold the ACTU and Labour Council disputes rules has itself contributed to the belief of some <span class="highlight">unions</span> that they can please themselves as to what action they take without regard to the consequences to themselves as ACTU affiliates or to members of other <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* Encouragement to union members to shed collective responsibility for the actions of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> as a whole and hide behind their so-called individual rights' leads to anarchy and allows the organised pro-communists to use their <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the union movement as a whole for their own domestic and international purposes.

* The Bill 's amendment to the definition of employee in clause 3, taken together with the proposed amendment to section 132, will leave unprotected, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania, substantial numbers of workers who, while not strictly employees, nevertheless rely on <span class="highlight">unions</span> for the protection of their interests as workers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* Because there is no registration of industrial <span class="highlight">unions</span> in those 2 States which are thus not covered in the Bill, thousands of workers who are now legitimately union members will be left unprotected if the Bill becomes law.

* Until yesterday the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> flatly refused any other attitude than that if a national conference were called of all sections- governments, employers and employees- he would call a conference of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to consider how far they would go to meet the situation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* When Dean Roscoe Pound speaks of the immunities of labour <span class="highlight">unions</span>- they are not the same in the United States of America as they are in Australia but they are very similar with a different but not dissimilar history- he points out in the opening gambit of his treatise: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* He refers to the church, to the state, to landlords and to commercial magnates gathering together in monopolies and then goes on to expound with all his understanding and knowledge of the law and objectivity in regard to politics that the immunities of the labour <span class="highlight">unions</span> are unique and have to be corrected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* A whole series of authorities in recent years, particularly in the last 10 years, have pointed out how the <span class="highlight">unions</span> having this monopolistic power to dislocate industry under the name of what  Senator Harradine  referred to as the right to strike and, presumably since he objects to the Trade Practices Bill, the right to employ secondary boycotts in enforcement of the right to strike, claim the right to dislocate the economy of the country to the great injury of other sections of the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* None of us will decry the efforts that were made by his Minister for Labour and Immigration,  Senator James  McClelland, in the last three or four desperate months of the Whitlam era to try to curb the abuse of the use by trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> of political pretext in order to create demands for higher charges and dislocation in industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* That is because the <span class="highlight">unions</span> add to their legitimate union strength and force the other coercive effort to call a strike or secondary boycott and dislocate the economy and artificially create an upsurge in what their opponents are prepared to yield rather than have that dislocation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* To suggest that we would reach the stage where <span class="highlight">unions</span> would consider it in their interests to deregister from that system and expose themselves to the law of the jungle and to the chaos of the strike weapon is deplorable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* That shows that, far from the Government feeling that deregistration would ever be considered an advantage by a union, it is considered as one of the warning signals that <span class="highlight">unions</span> should observe before they enter upon the sort of action to which I have briefly referred which can be considered as inimical to the public interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* Even though the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, when it met last week, had commended the proposal of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> for a summit conference,  Mr Fraser  would have none of it.

* It was merely to back the <span class="highlight">unions</span> into a corner where they could not possibly accept his proposal for a freeze without selling out their members and so he could then say to the public, in the hope that they would be gullible enough to fall for it: 'There you are, the sole responsibility for the continuation of inflation rests with the <span class="highlight">unions</span>'.

* The first is exemplified by the freeze, which I have just discussed very briefly as I have limited time, which was nothing but a public relations exercise to fit the blame onto the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and also to throw a smoke screen around his own bankruptcy as an economic manager.

* How can the Prime Minister expect the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to trust him when he introduced into the Parliament the legislation which has been discussed so ably and in such detail by  Senator Harradine,  first of all in relation to this misconceived monster, an Industrial Relations Bureau? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* The purpose of the Industrial Relations Bureau is to create a third arm of government which will do precisely what the employers have learned is counter-productive and of which they will have no part, that is, to ask a court to impose penalties on the <span class="highlight">unions</span> for industrial actions.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* The legislation also contains invitations to unionists and to people who do not join <span class="highlight">unions</span> to scab during a strike and exaggerated protection is given to people who take this action.

* But more than that, a close reading of these provisions which have not reached us yet- I understand that they will be allowed to lie on the table of the House of Representatives for a few weeks in order to allow people to give their opinion of them- will reveal that these are the measures of a government which then turns to the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and says: 'Trust us to look after your interests as well as the interests of the rest of society'.

* It has been departed from in failure to consult with the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> about amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; in failure to consult in connection with the so-called secret ballot legislation; in failure to consult in relation to the proposed amendments to the trade practices legislation; and in the series of broken promises in relation to the Commonwealth Government's attitude to wage indexation.

* It was in 1906, following the Taff Vale judgment in Britain when it was decided that <span class="highlight">unions</span> could be sued and were liable for damages- and an award of damages was imposed on the railways <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Britain- that the Trade Disputes Act, which made union funds exempt from claims for damages, was passed.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* In the context of a record of broken promises, a record of total abandonment of the philosophy which  Mr Street,  as Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, put forward in 1975; a total abandonment of promises in relation to wage indexation and other matters in 1975, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  rejected the proposals put by the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and invited the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to trust this Government.

* For this reason, and because of the fundamental importance of the legislation, it believes that there is a need for time to be given not only for the members of Parliament to give the proposed legislation their objective consideration, but also for the principal parties to industrial relations- the peak councils of the employer organisations and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, individual trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and individual employers and, more importantly, the community at large- to examine the contents of the Bill and to be able to make their views known to the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* I shall read from a document which is the submission by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on 19 April 1977, put by R.

* The basic reason  Mr Fraser  and some of his Public Service advisors were attracted to  Mr Hamer's  vague idea in the first place was that they saw the possibility of creating an emotional climate where the <span class="highlight">unions</span> would be forced to accept even bigger cuts in real wages or at the least the blame for the avalanche of prices increases which are already in the pipeline as a result of devaluation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0)

* In my view that in a nutshell is precisely what the Fraser Government's industrial policy has been designed to bring about- a confrontation in the hope that it will enable the Government to shift attention from its own mismanagement and to blame it on the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and so bemuse the people into believing that if it had not been for the <span class="highlight">unions</span> taking what is the proper stand and the stand they are entitled to take on behalf of their members, this so-called wages-prices freeze or this myth- it cannot be described as anything else- may otherwise have succeeded.

* This was a proposition which was put to both employers and <span class="highlight">unions</span> by not only the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  but also every State Premier, both Labor and Liberal, and it would appear that the honourable senators on the Opposition benches just do not agree with it.

* But as this report of the Jackson Committee will show, it is a gross oversimplification of the problems of manufacturing industry, and it is an exaggeration that we hear every day from our opponents, to say that all the difficulties of manufacturing industry are due to the excessive wage demands of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and that if only the <span class="highlight">unions</span> could be put in their place all would be well with manufacturing industry.

* Contrary to what I thought a few years ago when I doubted whether we ought to be seeking amalgamation of <span class="highlight">unions</span>, I think it would simplify matters if the number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> was reduced to a certain extent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0)

* Perhaps I should say that I think this has been a very successful operation because I know that management and the union have met under the control of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> since a Bill was passed during Labor's term in office and great progress has been made in the area of wages, which I thought was a very complicated issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0)

* While the Government is concerned at the irresponsible attitude being taken by maritime <span class="highlight">unions</span> over this matter which is causing a significant increase in transport costs from delays to vessels, responsibility for the problem rests clearly with the parties concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0)

* However, the protection which employees are to be afforded from the prohibition will also be available to trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their officers where the only persons with whom they act in concert are employees of the one employer and the conduct is engaged in for a dominant purpose of the type to which I have already referred.

* In his second reading speech, the Minister stated the Government's view that there was a need for time to be given not only for members of Parliament to give the proposed legislation their objective consideration but also for the principal parties to industrial relations- the peak councils of the employer organisations and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, individual trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers and the community at large- to examine the contents of the Bill and to be able to make their views known to the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0)

* A proposal was circulated to provide a basis for discussion with organisations representative of the Australian meat and livestock industries and in early November 1976 wide ranging consultations were held with over fifty representatives of major industry organisations, <span class="highlight">unions</span> and consumers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0)

* ACSPA-a confederation of 37 <span class="highlight">unions</span> with 400 000 membershas consistently opposed the proposed Industrial Relations Bureau, and the union's  president, Mr Philip  Reilly, last night repeated its continuing opposition to any penal clauses.

* If ACSPA changes its mind and wishes to take up the offer made by  Mr Hawke  on behalf of the ACTU to give ACSPA one of the places given to the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, certainly the Government would raise no objection whatsoever to that.

* To me that sounds very clearly as though he is saying that the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> would offer no objection to the penalties and processes that already exist in the hands of the Bureau.

* The dichotomy- the 2 strains -in Government policies is no better indicated than by the quite genuine efforts, I believe, of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  from time to time to adopt the second approach and the quite obvious efforts of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  in overbearing his Minister, to adopt the other approach from time to time in what he sees as an appropriate electoral response to dissatisfaction with the position of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> within the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* All these steps were taken as part of a concerted effort to weaken both the numerical and financial strengths of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia, which of course have been a consistent part of one strand of Liberal Party thinking on this issue for a long time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* I say that because in the field of industrial relations it is not often considered sufficiently that it is the abuse of monopoly power by labour <span class="highlight">unions</span>- I say abuse although of course they have very many uses that are quite laudable- which is the chief contributer to inflation.

* When one comes to the question of consequences, which is the part that has been dropped from this Bill- that is to say, the means by which the rules which  Senator Button  concedes are essential for discipline on the part of any organism of modern complicated society- one finds, I think, a very sad failure to appreciate what is appropriate in the world of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and commerce. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* The anathema to them stems from the fact that they were practically the only means used to harass trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> during the last century, during the convict era when contract of service was enforced and even breach of the contract of service caused imprisonment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* But at the same time as we move from that, we do not want to take heed of  Senator Button's  suggestion that if we criticise the Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> Dispute Act of 1 906 and all its immunities we are going back to the reactionary stage.

* It would be essential now in relation to this civil obligation to pay damages for breach of an award or of an agreement to give the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> the satisfaction of limiting their liability so that a small trade union could not be completely annihilated if, as occurred in the air traffic controllers strike, it caused millions of dollars of damage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* Until we get some system like that it is a matter for tears and a matter of great regret to find that even the attempts of the original Bill to bring consequences and responsibility on trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> have been jettisoned- abandoned- in what I think was an unmitigated defeat of the Bill, complicated as the situation was by the existence of the air traffic controllers strike and the confused intermingling of politicians at that time in an absolutely fatuous referendum.

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> were previously members of the Council and knew its ramifications but this proposed new body is not the body that was envisaged by those who attended the conference between the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and the Minister, because the Australian Council for Salaried and Professional Associations, one of the biggest organisations of employees, is not to be included in the Council.

* The consultations came only after the ACTU had examined the idea of the Bureau and decided that the Bureau was, in fact, a new attempt to impose more effectively penalties upon the union movement and also to reinforce, within employment, the actions and strengths of those people who do not believe in joining <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* The Opposition does not oppose the new National Labour Consultative Council because it knows that it is an attempt to establish again something like the old National Labour Advisory Body, which was set up during my time on the ACTU Executive and which was supported to the stage when the ACTU and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> considered that the then Government was using too powerfully the penal powers of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* No, not Malcolm Fraser in 1977 but Stanley Melbourne Bruce in May 1928, when he was introducing a Bill that increased Federal powers in the conciliation and arbitration system and imposed proper controls on the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* Because of public pressure, because of the reasonable and sensible proposals that were put forward by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, the Government was obliged to think again about its industrial relations proposals, and the legislation which is before us now is the result of that rethinking. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is not by threatening to use any means at the Government's disposal to break strikes or to place at risk the functioning of the trade union movement, it is not by pressuring employer organisations or business into confronting the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and taking an especially hard line in negotiations with them, that industrial peace is generated.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* Industrial peace in this country is more likely to result from <span class="highlight">unions</span>, employers and governments achieving a capacity to reach a satisfactory solution to deal with different problems as they arise instead of threatening the trade union movement in advance.

* I congratulate the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations for finally recognising the determination of this Government to introduce an Industrial Relations Bureau and then for offering no objection to its formation, on certain terms, and for offering to join the reconstituted National Labour Advisory Council. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0)

* I believe those two major reforms have led to greater competition and, indeed, a breakthrough in the area of reducing control over businesses held by the horizontal and vertical price fixing arrangements which were very common in the 1 950s and 1960s and which, consequently, led to a lack of competition in business and to continued sweetheart agreements with trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which flowed through to the arbitration system, thereby imposing higher costs in the community.

* An underhand attempt has been made to pay some recognition to the submissions that were made to the Government by the trade union movement through the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and by the consumer organisations which represent a very large proportion of the Australian community.

* This statement which the Senate is now examining suggests that companies which are prepared to give consideration to claims that are legitimately and properly placed before them by the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> as representing the views of wage and salary earners can be penalised as a result of actions by the Minister of the day. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42)

* It calls for co-operation from all groups- the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the consumers and the community at large- to try to assist in some better economic upturn and responses. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42)

* In view of the obvious importance of this matter to a large number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> registered under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, will the Minister consider the call of the national  president  of Australia 's third largest union for an inquiry into the course of those protracted proceedings and whether amendments or repeal of any provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is indicated to avoid a repetition of such protracted and costly proceedings?

* Senator Ryan  has acknowledged that the Commission has two representatives of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, although she seems to think that they are not as representative as they might be because they voted in a way she did not approve of in respect of meeting a delegation of staff.

* One particular misconception that must be dispelled- a misconception strongly held by some of the more militant doctors' <span class="highlight">unions</span>- is that the health industry operates in a free-market situation and will respond favourably to free-market pressures.

* It is rather ironical that the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce- it is chaired by  Senator Jessop-  of which I am a member had some of the captains of industry before it and they could not deny that probably the salvation of the Australian manufacturing industry is more militancy from the Asian trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* -Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations been drawn to the editorial in this morning's  Australian  calling for the Government to convene a meeting between <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers to hammer out what is called 'a commonsense approach to dealing with the anachronism of penalty rates and the five-day week'? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0)

* That is a pertinent interjection because I was about to say that in the 1948 case before the Arbitration Court, when the <span class="highlight">unions</span> argued for a reduction in the working week from 44 hours to 40 hours, those very arguments were put forward- that the costs would be so great that the country's economy would be sent broke. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0)

* In addition, business, industry, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and other non-governmental bodies and a large number of individuals ask for details that should be available to it, to enable them to plan their activities and carry out their various functions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0)

* The Minister will recall that during debates on the conciliation and arbitration Bills there has always been the argument that the old inspectorate section which has now been taken over by the Bureau was never anxious to prosecute employers and prosecutions against <span class="highlight">unions</span> were certainly more numerous than those against employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* You also asked about discussions with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* So having regard for the general obligations and the need for coordination, the railway <span class="highlight">unions</span> and many citizens have protested against what has been envisaged. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* Furthermore, there will be no closures without an adequate period of notice being given to the railway customers and <span class="highlight">unions</span> affected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* We have asked the Minister to consider something more than that: Rather than just give advice to the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the customers and regional people where lines may be cut out, such proposals as are advanced should be circulated publicly so that there can be an adequate reaction from citizens and staff organisations in respect of them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* A number of propositions have been floated about certain South Australian lines that are now in the hands of ANR, but they have not been discussed with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> or the citizens. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* I am advised that the ANR has a consistent policy of working in close collaboration with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and all who work for it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40)

* Thus when the situation arose in which the Government invited public comment on the report, many members of the public, indeed trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and other official bodies, were unable to get a copy even within the first few weeks of the three month period that was allowed for discussion. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Minister has said- I answered a question earlier today on his behalf to this effect- that he hopes that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the employers will take a new attitude in relation to this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-28-0)

* It is not a question of the Minister, the Government or indeed employers imposing anything on the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and workers in this matter in the way  Senator Harradine  seems to have interpreted it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-28-0)

* What the Minister is saying is that the Government will encourage both <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers to take a new attitude to this subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Ministers will recall previous questions asked by me in which I have indicated that the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> has said in a number of statements that it would take part in a national conference on unemployment and that  Mr Hawke  has stated more recently that he and his associated authorities are quite prepared to sit down with the Government and confer about the state of the economy? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0)

* It must be a permanent group consisting of representatives from the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the Public Service and farmers sitting together, not in a grandstanding exercise such as the exercise that will take place soon in Victoria, but in camera hearing evidence and trying to get together and reach a compromise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0)

* The only solution is to have a task force representing all parties- the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, employers and governments- each giving a little. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0)

* I am not asking the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to give up penalty rates for nothing but why can the Government and the employers not get together with the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and say to them that penalty rates, and indeed casual rates, are destroying the economy and sending many decent people out of work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0)

* In conclusion I repeat that none of these solutions or many of the others that could be put could be contemplated unilaterally by the Government, by the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, by the employers or even by this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0)

* There is a case now being mounted by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> to extend maternity leave to the private sector. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0)

* As  Senator Ryan  said, the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> is looking at the maternity leave provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0)

* However, I believe that it is the duty of government to encourage discussion between industry, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Australian people of what our industrial goals should be 10 or 20 years from now so that a reasoned progression can be made towards those goals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0)

* The unfortunate result of the present system is that it protects not only industries; sometimes it also protects inadequate performance, both by management and <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0)

* Certainly, the effects of the introduction of new technology must be discussed in advance with the work force and the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0)

* Now we must increase efficiency and raise productivity, which means upgrading management skills and modifying union practices, principally by encouraging <span class="highlight">unions</span> to move from a craft based organisation to an industry based one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0)

* I am also advised that the Board has written to the various <span class="highlight">unions</span> and that there are discussions in train with respect to the position of officers who are required by their duties as unattached officers to make public statements on matters which are critical of the Service and so on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0)

* 
 Mr Searle I think I was seeking to indicate that when we are involved in contingency planning which could involve aircrews and so on in a new type of operation involving quarantine and disease, we do indeed consult with <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#debate-63)

* In addition to newspapers, they also rely on the mail for the delivery of various publications issued by nonprofit making groups, including the Returned Services League, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, rural associations, charity organisations, pensioner organisations, incapacitated persons clubs and various religious groups.

* I know that at a time like this we would have economic chaos if every tourist to Australia wanted to become a permanent resident but, together with one of my  former trade union colleague,  Senator Gordon  Mcintosh, I know that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> are adopting a reasonable attitude to this matter.

* Individual <span class="highlight">unions</span> may combine to form Federations and these may in turn form Confederations provided they are recognised and registered by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-97-1)

* Of course, by virtue of that provision substantial penalties can be imposed on persons, including <span class="highlight">unions</span>, engaged . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-81-0)

* One can examine every major strike that this country has had since the Fraser Government came to power and note that it has been settled through the conciliation and arbitration system and largely, if not exclusively, as a result of the negotiating efforts of the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, whom this Government indulges in the luxury of abusing from time to time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-81-0)

* I believe that trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> also should be subject to such legislation and I have no doubt that it will be understood by the public that this is what this Bill does. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-81-0)

* What it is about is the protection of the interests of business, not from the depredations of monopolies or from other people unfairly manipulating market power, but rather from the legitimate activities of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their members; protection from trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their officials doing the kind of things for the protection of their members that they have done since time immemorial and that they will go on doing so long as they are to discharge the trust and the confidence that their members vest in them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4)

* Under section 76 of the parent Act, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> or their officials are liable for statutory penalties of up to $250,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4)

* Under section 45d, any kind of industrial action which is aimed at hindering the movement of goods or services to or from a corporation- the corporation in question not being the immediate employer of those applying the bans- subjects <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their officials to these sorts of penalties. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4)

* It has a particular, and immediate and an obvious application in the service industries to <span class="highlight">unions</span> which are engaged in the packing, the storage, the transport and the distribution of goods from corporation to corporation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4)

* That point, of course, has not been lost on employers in that area and in recent days writs have been flying around like confetti against <span class="highlight">unions</span> like the Transport Workers Union and the Storemen and Packers Union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4)

* Seventhly, it has to be said, acknowledged and noted that the certainly regrettable but all too familiar feature of our industrial scene- demarcation disputes between <span class="highlight">unions</span> as to their respective coverage in a particular work place- would also be quite outside the scope of those exemption provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4)

* But what I am saying is that there is an enormous range of forms of industrial action of the kind in which trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their members have always engaged and will always engage from time to time so long as this is necessary to protect the interests of the working men and women of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4)

* The argument is made, and no doubt it will be made again by someone in the course of this debate, that what this Act is really doing is simply giving a bargaining counter to the employers, giving them some muscle with which to force the <span class="highlight">unions</span> into a posture of retreat and compromise, and that its real significance is as a counterbalance to the raw brute force of industrial bargaining power exercised by the <span class="highlight">unions</span> themselves.

* With this legislation the Government is guaranteeing a perpetuation of demarcation disputes in Australia into the indefinite future, and probably a future splitting of <span class="highlight">unions</span> or trade associations into even smaller groups- the definition is very broadsimply for the reason that it is a protective mechanism to defend themselves against what I might say is a very bone-headead piece of legislation.

* Two difficulties are involved: The first is a humanitarian one, and the second is an administrative one, one aspect of which was just outlined by  Senator Harradine  when he explained the difficulties which will be created for the <span class="highlight">unions</span> if this sort of approach to industrial relations is adopted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58)

* I point out that one thing which came out of that dispute was that a large percentage, something like 50 per cent, of the people who were put out of work by the strike, many of whom belonged to the same <span class="highlight">unions</span> because a number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> were involved in the strike, had practically no savings- I think the figure was less than $75- in the bank. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58)

* That will lead to further administrative difficulties; not the administrative difficulties which will arise in individual <span class="highlight">unions</span>, which  Senator Harradine  pointed out, but the administrative difficulties which will arise for the Director-General of Social Services, or more often for his delegates- the people to whom he delegates the power to decide. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58)

* I think it has been clearly demonstrated by  Senator Cavanagh, Senator Harradine  and others that the manner in which trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> operate in this community- the manner in which trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> are structured in this community- will mean that the industrial situation will not get better as a result of this legislation being enacted; in fact, it may get worse. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58)

* The implications, if  Senator Harradine  is right- I have no reason to believe he is wrong- are that we may be put in a situation in which some <span class="highlight">unions</span> will be asked to act illegally under the Government's arbitration legislation if they are to fulfil the letter of this law.

* Instead of larger <span class="highlight">unions</span>, which I believe are essential for this country, there will be a tendency through legislation such as this to divide big organisations into small groups. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58)

* If members of a trade union cause a strike which in turn means that others in other <span class="highlight">unions</span> or in the same union are stood down and there is a great deal of unemployment as a result- even if a key-worker strike is disowned by the federal executive body- it would seem to me that collective responsibility in that instance ought to be stressed.

* If in Queensland there was a strike over a hazard or safety matter and the members of, say, the fettlers' union decided not to work on a part of a job which was declared to be unsafe, the people punished as a result under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and under this legislation would be the members of a small group of <span class="highlight">unions</span>.
