* As the honourable gentleman has suggested, yesterday's strike within the New South Wales power industry by certain <span class="highlight">unions</span> is a further example of the growing militancy of <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia and the attempt by some <span class="highlight">unions</span> to exercise their industrial power in deliberately seeking to coerce both employers and the general community by taking direct action outside the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service might smile at that and he might think that rather extravagant language, but I can assure him that it will be echoed by a very large number of people in this country - by those people who are members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and particularly by members of Public Service <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> that have been under attack by the Minister support the view that the Post Office should be severed from Public Service Board control, lt follows that they would then have only 2 bodies dealing with Post Office disputes - the Post Office itself and, if employees could not get their arguments in regard to wage rates determined there, finally the Commission.

* The honourable member for Stirling alleged that undue pressure was exerted on the Public Service Board in order to prevent wage rises, but he said nothing about the irresponsible pressure exerted by certain <span class="highlight">unions</span> on other workers and the community generally when they refuse to make use of the means available to them to deal with their claims and resort to direct action, when 'hey refuse to take advantage of the very processes of conciliation and arbitration which the honourable member for Stirling says he supports.

* Again I emphasise that this provision puts employees subject to the Public Service Arbitration Act on the same footing as those subject to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, including - I draw the attention of the House to this - giving <span class="highlight">unions</span> the right to make an application to the Public Service Arbitrator to call a conference on matters affecting them.

* On the contrary, the Bill before the House gives the Arbitrator power to deal with <span class="highlight">unions</span> not party to  the  dispute, and the Government in a political capacity, through a Minister, can buy into a dispute by which public servants are affected.

* Let us examine what happened after the 1965 legislation the purpose of which was the same as that which the Government must be accused of pursuing today - the enacting of legislation in the hope that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> would over-react and the Government would win an election on that issue.

* But the Minister for Labour and National Service and previous Ministers for Labour and National Service have gone along to various levels of employer organisations to persuade them not to do this because they were fearful that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> might come to some form of agreement with the employers and that the Government would lose another stick to use in an election campaign.

* The record does not bear this out and it is supported, 1 believe, by the fact that there has not been a request from the membership of any of the 3 <span class="highlight">unions</span> for a 'court controlled ballot' for a considerable number of years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0)

* Let us face the facts: The more difficult the Act, the greater is the collusion to defeat its provisions between the larger <span class="highlight">unions</span> in the interests of their members and the employers with whom they are dealing, who co-operate in the interests of common sense and the welfare of their employees, who are associated with the <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* Going back again to community attitudes, one of the things we are told by the <span class="highlight">unions</span> is that they would be more responsible if we could hold prices down. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0)

* The other ways in which we could get a different community attitude, as several honourable members responsibly said, is by having a different kind of attitude towards tariffs so that we would not have this unused tariff protection which would enable manufacturers to put their prices up if the labour <span class="highlight">unions</span> took industrial action which made their position more difficult.

* The trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which, as 1 have said, are having a subtle change in their leadership - they are getting better educated men and men who look to the public interest more than was done in the old days - would lose their respect for this tribunal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21)

* We will let the Public Service <span class="highlight">unions</span> of this country know that this is only one semblance of the reflection of the manner in which honourable members opposite would seek to disturb wage relativities - by placing a freeze upon the white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21)

* I ask the Committee to reflect on the representations which have come in from the Public Service <span class="highlight">unions</span>, to reflect also on the fact that what the Opposition has called for in the white collar area in this context is no more or any less than a wage freeze and to consider the question of the disturbance of wage relativities which in fact their position would certainly involve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21)

* The Minister, ignoring his advisers but being pressured by his own Cabinet, by  Mr Polites  and all sorts of other employer representatives whom I have seen skulking around the corridors of this Parliament, has brought down legislation which in the future will make it impossible for <span class="highlight">unions</span> to amalgamate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* The very nature and the effects of the amendments contained in the Bill make it patently clear that either the Government has no knowledge or appreciation of what is required to improve employer and union relationships or it has deliberately set a course that not only will further aggravate the existing position but also will bring about a situation in which it will be well nigh impossible for <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers working in concert to prevent minor issues from becoming major stoppages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* This in itself quite often made it very difficult for union officials to prevail upon the work force and the members of their <span class="highlight">unions</span> to continue working while negotiations were taking place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* It is concerned that <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers should be each enjoying the respect of the other and be able to negotiate on reasonable terms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* What  Mr Polites  was advocating was that if any wage justice exists in this country by way of some democratic system it should be replaced by a system of absolute dictatorship, a dictatorship controlled by a Liberal Government in collaboration with the Employers Federation, which could stop any further progress by <span class="highlight">unions</span> towards obtaining a better deal for their members and, in turn, obtaining a fairer share of profits resulting from greater efforts of workers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* I believe it is clear from what we have heard during this debate that it would be the spectacle of a government controlled by the power of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> which would be able to strike with impunity against awards of the Commission; a government which by withdrawing the sanctions provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would relegate the position of that Commission and effectively erode its power; a government which wanted for the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> all the advantages of arbitration but apparently was not prepared to accept the obligations which that system necessarily imposes; a government which certainly would condone an increase in industrial unrest and strike activity; a government which would fail to protect the public interest in proceedings before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; a government which apparently refused to recognise the fundamental reality that the rapid escalation in wage and salary costs is the mainspring problem of inflation in Australia's present circumstances; and a government which, because of that, certainly would fuel the fires of inflation and not contain them as contained they ought to be at present because of the impact that spiral has upon the disadvantaged groups in the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* Is it a belief that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> not only are happy beyond the law but are beyond criticism? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* The Government, however, has a total responsibility for the economy of the country and what happens in the field of industrial relations between employers and <span class="highlight">unions</span> can be of profound significance for the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* Those provisions are designed, and properly so, to ensure effective membership control of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* It is to stop the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers from reaching agreement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* It is difficult to understand why jurisdiction over bans clauses, which are objectionable to the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, should be the sole preserve of  a  presidential member. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* Once a stopage of work takes place the emphasis will be on penalising the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the bans clause will be put into awards so that penalties may be imposed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* As I said in the debate on the second reading of this Bill, the Minister will find that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will not register agreements if there is a danger of the agreements being disallowed by appeal or otherwise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* He understands the point of view at least of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and because of the number of times he has appeared against employers he probaby also understands the point of view of the employers and their representatives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* If, during conciliation meetings, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> feel that they have persuaded the conciliation commissioner on a point of some relevance that there is something to their case and that their members in fact will strike if they cannot get some particular concessions, it is ridiculous if none of this evidence can be put to the arbitration commissioner and if the arbitration commissioner who finally makes the decision is a completely different person from the conciliation commissioner who originally heard the matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* On the other hand, he says to the employers: 'If you expect to resist the <span class="highlight">unions</span>' claim for a 10 per cent shift allowance for night work, let me tell you now that I am going to grant it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* What about the <span class="highlight">unions</span> dropping their claim for 3 weeks sick leave and the employer facing up to the fact that if he does not give the 10 per cent allowance for the night shift, 1 will have no alternative but to award it?' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* The provisions in this proposed new section amount to a threat against the <span class="highlight">unions</span> as this Government likes to do on the question of arbitration, without any point whatsoever. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* Proceedings were held in a court in Adelaide and at that time one prominent trade union official from one of the metal <span class="highlight">unions</span> was very ill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* I can understand these provisions where <span class="highlight">unions</span> are directly involved or organisations are directly involved but for a penalty of this sort to be hanging over the heads of people who are more or less innocent bystanders in a dispute is more than the average person should be called upon to bear and is more than the average person in the community would tolerate if he knew the full facts of the case and the implications of the subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* It strikes me that the Government and everyone else is arguing, and we are supporting, that in arbitration and conciliation there should be as much democracy as possible in relation to <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* The Government ought to recognise that some agreements might provide for things like seniority, absolute preference or preference for financial members of <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* We note, says the Government in its own counsels, a marked tendency on the part of both <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers to keep outside a system of arbitration which they claim to be expensive, provocative and frustrating. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* Further, it means that individual <span class="highlight">unions</span> have been engaged in collective bargaining with individual employers to obtain better rates of pay and, in the case of the waterside workers and other <span class="highlight">unions</span> as well, better working conditions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* As a result it has introduced proposed new section 31 in which it will not be possible for individual <span class="highlight">unions</span> to make individual gains from individual employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* I would be of the opinion that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> are successful because the employers agree to increases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* I ask the Minister, if <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers sat around the table and, on a balanced evaluation of the situation in the 6 States, found that something was in the national interest according to the States in direct opposition to the Commonwealth, an agreement could not be ratified on that basis because according to the Commonwealth Government it was against the public interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* Is it unreasonable for <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers collectively to sit around the table and figure out that an industry can afford to make such provision in the State jurisdiction in which they are negotiating? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* I would like to refer to the expressed desire of the Government to hand over to the Commission the agreements that are made between consenting parties on an industrial basis concerning <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers on the one hand or a group of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and a group of employers on the other.

* It is not beyond the realm of possibility - in fact it has been mentioned before - that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> will seek to have an agreement between themselves and a particular employer on medical benefits, travel concessions and, as I have already mentioned, retiring allowances. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* One that comes to mind is that this Government in a Bill which came before this House some 2 years ago saw fit to apply a different standard, if I may use that term, to credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> than applied to other financial organisations.

* A lot has been said this afternoon and this evening about the question of public interest and the situation on the waterfront where the employers and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> negotiated an agreement which resulted in reduced working hours and increased wages.

* It was not generally realised by <span class="highlight">unions</span> writing into their awards and agreements these procedures for settlement of disputes that the procedures were in fact a bans clause and that anybody in breach of the procedures for settlement of disputes were just as liable to penalties stipulated under section 119 of the Act as they would have been had they been working under an award containing  a  normal bans clause put into that award by the Commission itself.

* This fact, coupled with the Government's policy of wage and salary freezing, and the unlimited right of manufacturers and retailers to increase prices, will place employees, particularly those represented by <span class="highlight">unions</span> which adhere to the ordinary processes of conciliation and arbitration, in an impossible position.

* The members of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> are naturally looking to the Government to protect them against the tyranny of trade union officials, and that is what this Bill is all about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* It does not satisfy the viciousness of the Government to impose the penal clauses upon the trade union movement; the Government wants to make sure that it humiliates the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to the utmost because for many years when it has come to the real crunch and the Government has gone to the point of imposing a penalty and seeking to collect it, there is generally some good fairy who comes to life and pays the money.

* Even if it were accepted that of those not voting 50 per cent were in favour and 50 per cent against - a more reasonable assumption - then the amalgamation proposal could be said to have had the support of more than 50 per cent of total membership of each of the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* At the behest of the Democratic Labor Party he has made it much harder for <span class="highlight">unions</span> to amalgamate, in spite of what he had to say about the representatives of 15 small <span class="highlight">unions</span> having been present at a conference in relation to one issue and his statement that that had occurred on many occasions in regard to his Department itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* If <span class="highlight">unions</span> could amalgamate and there was a bigger body of <span class="highlight">unions</span> of similar types they could have specialists, they could have an officer dealing with industrial matters and they could have a man dealing with compensation, apart from the administration of those matters which are very necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* The honourable member for Stirling wants to know whether, in the event of the proceedings now before the Industrial Court going against the amalgamated <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Court holding that the application was not properly lodged, and that it therefore was a nullity, and that there was in fact no application legally before the Registrar, this clause will not help them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* Unless the Government does this, the amalgamated <span class="highlight">unions</span> run the risk, after long delays, of being told that this amalgamation, which really sparked off the whole controversy following an attempt by the Government to reach a compromise with the Democratic Labor Party, will not be allowed to proceed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* It will take 3 times as long to comply with those formalities as it takes to comply with the present requirements of the Act, and it has taken these <span class="highlight">unions</span> more than 2 years to comply with them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26)

* Is the Minister aware that the Australian Federation of Police <span class="highlight">Unions</span> recently passed a resolution calling on all members of this Parliament, both Government and Opposition, to assist police to maintain law and order in the light of the growing tendency to resort to organised violence at demonstrations in the streets and in other places?

* Is the Treasurer aware that when I moved the motion at the Launceston conference of the Australian Labor Party to provide for adequate representation of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> on boards, commissions, trusts, etc., and in the management of banking, insurance, mass media, transport and other things I told the conference that the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition in the [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#debate-12)

* As far as the constitutional power is concerned, I would like to see the written advice of the Leader of the Opposition on the constitutional issue saying that the Labor Party does not have power mandatorily to require adequate representation of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in the management of such area as broadcasting and television, insurance and banking in which there is undoubted Commonwealth power to legislate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#debate-12)

* It was made perfectly clear to the conference that all that a Labor Government could do would be to encourage the development that is already taking place in Australia, where important companies are putting representatives of <span class="highlight">unions</span> on their boards of management, and with very good effect. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#debate-14)

* Then the Treasurer went on to say that I was telling an untruth - he suggested it but I do not think that he would intend that to be inferred - or misleading the Parliament when I said that I had told the conference that it was not possible to provide for representatives of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to be on the boards of Government enterprises, such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission and bodies and commissions of this kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#debate-14)

* There is no point in seeking to try to get some small advantage which might help an Opposition come into Government because in the fields of defence of Australia and in the fields of the good government of Australia and in the fields of having a government which is not controlled by outside bodies and in the fields of having a government which is not controlled by militant left wing <span class="highlight">unions</span>, this is the most important thing but it does not obviate the requirement that we, being a LiberalCountry Party in government, should continue in government but should also seek to serve the national interests and consider these matters as they have been put and consider this matter as it has been put, and carry it to a conclusion, subject to the Government's having a reasonable time and being able to make reasonable arguments in return to those of us who wish this Bill to become law.

* If that system is to be put in peril because of direct negotiations, industrial unrest or <span class="highlight">unions</span> acting in defiance of the system, in the long run the workers of this country will be the losers, and certainly those groups in the community who are disadvantaged by wage negotiations but are not party to them will continue to be disadvantaged, as 1 believe is happening at the present time.

* Then when the Commonwealth Public Service <span class="highlight">unions</span> applied to the Public Service Arbitrator for an increase in the salaries of their members comparable to those already awarded to Victorian public servants, the Commonwealth moved to have the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission direct that a Full Bench of the Commission should hear the case, obviously to delay the hearing.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0)

* Finally, the 'Echuca' was allowed to sail and the National Line ships put to sea on the condition that there was set up a committee consisting of technicians from the Postmaster-General's Department and from, I think, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd, or some other experts in radio, as well as representatives of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> involved, to study the effect of the use of radio telephony as against wireless operation.

* The facts are that the committee is about to report back to me and, I imagine, to the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, and to the employer representatives, on the long term use of radio telephonists as against wireless operators.

* Before the Minister for Labour and National Service brought down the December 1971 statement of intent, meetings had taken place between the employers and the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> to investigate ways in which the Act might work more smoothly.

* These <span class="highlight">unions</span> had been working on this amalgamation for a period of about 3i years and had almost completed the necessary procedures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23)

* Finally, after repeated questioning he admitted that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> could be disadvantaged depending on the decision of the court on the question of deregistration of some of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> which was before it at that time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23)

* The amalgamation of the metal trades <span class="highlight">unions</span> as the Minister well knows took about 3 years to complete. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23)

* If the Bill had been returned in the form in which it left this chamber - that is, to come into effect on a date to be proclaimed - <span class="highlight">unions</span> would have been able to commence and complete the amalgamation proceedings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23)

* Only when finally pressed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  did the Minister say that there was no guarantee that the effects of this Bill would not be made applicable to these <span class="highlight">unions</span> that had come within one inch, after having run a distance of many miles, of consummating their amalgamation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23)

* The Minister has made it clear publicly that he believes there are too many <span class="highlight">unions</span> and that there should be an amalgamation of <span class="highlight">unions</span>, yet he has been instrumental in introducing this type of legislation which makes the amalgamation of <span class="highlight">unions</span> virtually impossible.

* I wonder whether this Government, which is placing all these impediments upon the amalgamation of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, which it seems to regard as different from every other organisation in the country, would be prepared to introduce into this House as an amendment to the Companies Act, the Trade Practices Act or any other Act, guidelines, rules and regulations to resolve the amalgamation of organisations such as Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, in respect of which we recently experienced a fiasco.

* The incident to which the honourable gentleman has referred which, of course, involves the State of South Australia which has a Labor Premier, is consistent with what I understand to be the policy of the Australian Labor Party that trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be put beyond the law in the sense that they would have immunity from civil action.

* Then in 1964, in the case known as Rookes v.

* If the honourable gentleman has studied the lessons of collective bargaining in those countries in which it is used as a substitute for the system of conciliation and arbitration, he will know that in all of those countries very heavy penalties are involved in the industrial jurisdiction for trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which break industrial agreements.

* The honourable gentleman's system, if applied, would be collective bludgeoning because the battalions of which he speaks are the battalions of the trade union movement and they would not be subject to any restriction except the so-called moral restriction and restraint which could be imposed and applied by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>.

* It would be a question of picking them off, one against the other, in relation to the specific matter of placing <span class="highlight">unions</span> above the law, it is the Government's understanding that, as a matter of record, the official policy of the Australian Labor Party calls for legislation which would place <span class="highlight">unions</span> beyond the law in the sense which I will now explain to the honourable member for Hindmarsh.

* Congratulations are in order both for the dedicated and devoted leaders of the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> and, I may say, for the Federal Minister for Housing  (Mr Kevin Cairns),  who has shown a rare quality not only to come to grips with the detailed intricacies of home finance but also to understand the broad economic and social responsibilities that governments must assume in this field. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0)

 Mr Speaker, I have already said on several occasions that it remains for individual credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> to determine whether they shall move more earnestly into housing loans, as now defined by the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0)

* As I have mentioned in this House before, there is a diverse pattern in overseas credit leagues and I have every confidence that the Australian credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> which decide to qualify for recognition under the homes savings grant scheme will do so responsibly and with as little disturbance as possible to their current lending patterns.

* This local control, local interest and local concern is a precious element in the credit union movement, and I hope that the extension of the homes savings grant scheme to facilitate the inclusion of credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> will not see any largescale amalgamation or centralising of authority and decision making. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0)

* Members of the credit union movement should ponder the thought when the Australian Labor Party makes its rash promises about what it will do for the credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> - and there was much of this at the opening of the premises that I have referred to - and remember that any government that is big enough to give everything is also big enough to take it away.

* The Opposition believes that there are 4 possible solutions: The enlargement of Commonwealth power to legislate for terms and conditions of employment in industry and for trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>; the transfer of certain powers to the Commonwealth by the States without referendum; complementary State and Federal legislation; or the encouragement of <span class="highlight">unions</span> to go through the procedures required by law for the dissolution of State <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the formation of State branches of federal <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* Eighthly, fining <span class="highlight">unions</span> instead of workers may destroy <span class="highlight">unions</span> as effective organisations; yet the existence of strong partners in negotiations is recognised by employers as a prerequisite of successful industrial relations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* One other factor to which I have time to refer quickly is the proposed protection of <span class="highlight">unions</span> from actions for tort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* I mention only that in 1968 the British Royal Commission into trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> brought down its report in which it found that the system which had operated from 1906 until 1968 in that regard should continue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* lt had been argued by the employers that that should not be the case, that <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be capable of being sued for actions for tort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* Every member of this House will remember that, prior to the elections, the then Leader of the Opposition met the members of the executive of the metal trades union and agreed with them that, if there were a  $25,000  grant to the compaign funds of the Australian Labor Party, he would ensure that fines would not be imposed on the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and that the bans clause in the Act would be abolished - in other words, to some extent reducing the effectiveness of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Arbitration Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* However, I have to go further and say that because of his continued hostility to arbitration, the present Minister for Labour is being ever so much more drastic than we would have contemplated from our knowledge of what occurred at the meeting between the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the executive of the metal trades <span class="highlight">unions</span> concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* That supports what I have said, namely, that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> are now put in an ever so much stronger position than before. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The balance of strength as between the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the employers, the Government and the Arbitration Commission is changed so seriously that no longer can one think that influences other than the predominance of trade union power can play an important part  in  ensuring the public interest  in  the way  in  which the former governments since the time of  Sir Robert  Menzies have incorporated this concept in the Act; in other words, to further the objectives of inducing co-operation between <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers and trying to engender a far better feeling throughout the whole complex of industrial relations and to establish the Arbitration Commission as a body that can respect the public interest, bring the parties together and bring about an award that we all hope will be for the benefit of the country rather than for the destruction of arbitration itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* Running right through all the comments that they made to this House was one theme only, a theme which they had used over the years, namely to bash the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in order to attain what they call industrial stability in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The Opposition's point of view is that in order to maintain what Opposition supporters have called industrial stability and industrial peace it is necessary to have penal sanctions against the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The Opposition believes that when the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> step out of line they should be penalised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* So we have an expression of opinion by many members of the community - I must say unrepresentative members of the community - that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> must be wrong on all occasions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* I could give the example of the waterfront where there has been industrial peace in regard to all of the stevedoring agreements around Australia since the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in that area have entered into agreements with employers rather than being thrust into the position where a third party would inflict its will upon them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The Metal Trades Union, which comes under most attack from members of the Opposition, has had far less warfare since there has been agreement in the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> than was the case when the situation was thrust upon them by arbitration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* I say to the people of Australia that it is not a fair situation and that the officials and members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be protected from the second barrel of the employer's gun. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The previous Government made it very difficult for trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to amalgamate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The whole attitude of the Australian Labor Party, especially in government but also out of government, is that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be encouraged to amalgamate so that many questions that can arise on a job - questions of disputation over who does which job - will not arise because the people concerned are members of the same union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* No-one on this side of the House denies the need for trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia, nor does anyone on this side of the House deny the right of working men and women to organise themselves into trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* I cannot claim to be a member of a trade union but I have had a long association with trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and I am grateful to those trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Western Australia which have shown their confidence in me because whilst they have known what my politics are they have given me plenty of work to do for them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* In truth, it is only the expression of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> wages policy, and that is something to which J will return later. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* This Bill is aimed at leaving <span class="highlight">unions</span> uncontrolled and uncontrollable by law or government at every point in the process of conciliation and arbitration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The result of this Bill must be for the trade union movement to move further and further away from both conciliation and arbitration - certainly by those major <span class="highlight">unions</span> formed by amalgamation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* Negotiated agreements cannot contain an anti-strike clause, so <span class="highlight">unions</span> are free to overturn an agreement at any time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* It is ironic that at a time when the United Kingdom has just repealed laws passed in 1906 giving civil immunity to <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the Minister is aiming to introduce those same laws into Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* An individual or employer economically hurt by calculated industrial attacks launched by <span class="highlight">unions</span> intending to harm or destroy by strike, boycott, picketing and sundry other sophisticated techniques of industrial coercion, is to be prevented from suing for compensation in a civil court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* This is what this Bill aims at giving to <span class="highlight">unions</span> for not even the Government, acting in the public interest, is to be allowed any right to control <span class="highlight">unions</span> when they use their industrial strength. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* Wage fixation principles, so reliably turned to in the past by <span class="highlight">unions</span>, employers and the Commission have been fragmented and eroded. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The Minister's proposals will not help because they try to graft full-blooded collective bargaining on to a system made for compulsory arbitration within which <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers were bound to accept a measure of control, and self-control, in return for the benefits which arbitration was intended to bring. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* If Australia is to have collective bargaining, let the legislation plainly and unmistakably spell it out, together with the rights, obligations and privileges of the participants and the protection for the public from the monopoly power of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and of employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* The past history of the Australian arbitration system can be seen as an expression of an acceptable wages policy for <span class="highlight">unions</span>, employers and Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* This Bill, on the other hand, can be seen to be the implementation of the wages policy of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, a policy designed to shift union action from achieving its wage claims inside the confines of the arbitration system to breaking those confines and moving outside arbitration. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* I was thankful to hear the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  refer to the General Motors-Holden's case in 1964 and confirm my own conclusions for me, because he put it clearly, in what he referred to as a non-arbitral area of over-award claims, that when the <span class="highlight">unions</span> went on strike in support of their over-award claims they opposed the attempt by employers to have the penal powers exercised against them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* It also interested me to hear him say this because I had the unique experience in 1969 of presenting a pay claim for the metal trades <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Western Australia based on the capacity of Western Mining Corporation to pay an industry allowance, being in effect the same as an over-award payment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* Congress calls upon the ACTU Executive to consult with State Branches, ACSPA and CCPSO in order to develop a strong campaign by the whole of the Trade Union Movement in support of our wages policy, and in particular to combat the utterly false propaganda of Federal Government spokesmen and employer interests that the <span class="highlight">Unions</span>' claims for proper wage rates are inflationary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23)

* This policy decision was a calculated turning away from the arbitration system at the top end of wages, leaving the Commission to fix a minimum wage and <span class="highlight">unions</span> free to bargain in the market place for anything above that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* Inevitably this debate will lead this Government to a confrontation with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> because, whatever else an incomes policy might be, it necessarily involves control over wages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* For 65 years, history shows the Arbitration Commission and the State industrial tribunals have been a stabilising influence on the economy, for in the process of preventing and settling disputes the Commission, by arbitration, shaped a wages policy for the nation, fought over but accepted broadly by <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers alike. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* That is basically what industrial arbitration is about - the fixing of wages and basic conditions of employment like annual leave, standard hours of work, concepts like the basic wage, margins, work value, comparative wage justice and conciliation, all principles turned to by <span class="highlight">unions</span>, employers and arbitrators. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* The complete immunity of <span class="highlight">unions</span> from strike action, either within the arbitration system or within the civil courts, marks the completion of the change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* Of necessity the policy will need to control wages, and of further necessity will require some control over the right of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to strike. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* As the Minister for Labour stated in his second reading speech, the Bill examines the need of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employer organisations for amalgamation, trade union education and closer consultation between <span class="highlight">unions</span>, employers and the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* As a member of one of the amalgamated metal <span class="highlight">unions</span> I have personal knowledge of the discussions to achieve amalgamation that took place over many years, not only between the officials of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> involved but also right down to the level of the member on the shop floor.

* When one considers that there are about 350 industrial organisations of employees throughout Australia and that some of those organisations have memberships that can be numbered in the hundreds, there is no doubt that there is certainly a need for a reduction in the number of <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* No doubt those who believe in the divide and rule principle will support a situation in which there is a large number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> with small memberships. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* But if we are seriously to consider our industrial relations a strong case exists for reducing the number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> covering workers throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* My own experience as a member of one of the amalgamated metal <span class="highlight">unions</span> showed me the wastefulness of <span class="highlight">unions</span> fighting <span class="highlight">unions</span> over which has jurisdiction over a certain class of work.

* The existing combined research centre operating in Sydney was set up by a couple of <span class="highlight">unions</span> of the amalgamated trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> prior to their amalgamation and certainly is an example of what can be achieved when union resources are pooled for the benefit of the members of those <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* I have listened to honourable members opposite speaking on this Bill and have heard them say mat they are concerned at the power to be given to trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, that the Government Bill ignores the effects of industrial unrest and seeks to give <span class="highlight">unions</span> carte blanche to become involved in industrial disputes and that no decision could be effective unless it is enforceable.

* The main cause today of industrial disputes is failure to consult - management standing on the so-called sacred rights of managerial prerogatives and saying that the worker is nothing but a servant, that the manager is the master, that the old 18th century relationship between master and servant still survives and that no spiritual, temporal or any other power of the Parliament, <span class="highlight">unions</span> or anybody else should interfere with this long-established but longoutmoded so-called right of managerial prerogatives.

* Fitzgibbon and not to  Mr Healy  - and having introduced his far-reaching and repressive legislation in 196S, he then agreed to a request of the executive of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, of which I was a member, to establish a conference between the warring parties to try, by conciliation, to resolve what appeared to be the interminable disputes in the stevedoring industry.

* Whether we go back in history to the methods used to transport recalcitrant workers to the colonies - and this did not prevent strikes or the organisation of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>; whether we look at the steps taken in Nazi Germany to send such strikers and workers to the concentration camps; whether we look at the tactics in eastern Europe where strikers were slaughtered with the guns and tanks of the Soviet Army; or whether we look at these miserable, contemptible and harsh penalties which have been divised through this legislation, none has ever resolved an industrial dispute.

* Clause 55, which is included in this group of clauses, provides for the insertion of a new section 146a which is intended to grant what has been briefly described as civil immunity to <span class="highlight">unions</span> and to union officials from any harm that is done to other persons by industrial action, except in certain specific cases mentioned in the section, namely, death or physical injury, physical damage to property or threats of that kind, or defamation.

* What this clause proposes is to prevent the replacement of monetary penalties upon a union with a law that allows individual penalties of imprisonment upon officials of <span class="highlight">unions</span> because the simple process - to follow the interjection of the honourable member for Stirling who knows the law so well - is to make an application for an injunction, having first of all established liability for torts, and then if the person does not refrain from the action which the injunction seeks to restrain him from continuing he is arrested and taken to prison.

* The only thing that <span class="highlight">unions</span> can do in these circumstances is to have somebody take the place of the man who is gaoled and for him to give the instruction for the boycott to continue, and as each person who gives the fresh instruction is prosecuted, tried, issued with an injunction and gaoled, somebody else will take his place until the gaols are full of honest, decent hard working men who have never committed a crime in their lives but who find themselves standing side by side with murderers, common thieves, pickpockets and prostitutes.

* This is the sort of reason that is being advanced as to why the <span class="highlight">unions</span> must be allowed to have a completely free hand - must be free from any sanction being imposed by way of a bans clause in an award, free of any clause in a voluntary agreement which would enable the employer to hold them to their agreement and freed completely from any tortious liability in the pursuit of their activities.

* A few days ago, when the Prime Minister pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the form of  Mr Hawke's  famous assurance on wage demand moderation by the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, I asked what right  Mr Hawke  had to make such a promise. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* With this sort of influence on the wage bargaining climate and expectation there is less effort on the part of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to try to hedge against increases in costs which will inevitably occur if we do not have some sort of authority to regulate them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* It provides the political and moral, not to say economic, grounds for the introduction of effective wage restraints and for the fairly drastic changes in the economic power of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which such restraints must inevitably involve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0)

* So there are built-in safeguards, firstly, for the employers who do not want to give it unless it has to be given; secondly, of course the machinery that exists to resolve a dispute that occurs when the employer or group of employers cannot settle their differences with the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* This has been our experience in the past and is now the experience of the United Kingdom where a recent gallup poll, referred to in 'The Economist' of 8 September 1973, showed that whereas a year ago 75 per cent of the people with a definite opinion said that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> should hold back on wage claims to control inflation but now 52 per cent think that they should now go ahead, clearly indicating that the public has become tired of income and wage controls.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25)

* Apparently the Government has chosen to persist with that provision in spite of the very detrimental impact and effect that it will have on the industrial jurisdiction and particularly on relations not simply between employers and employees in the industrial jurisdiction but more especially, in terms of the interest which the Minister seeks to serve, between employees and shop stewards and union officials, particularly member of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>.

* They forget that a little more than 12 months ago a very prominent member of the then Government suggested that that Government might call in foreign companies to try to act against the trade union movement in this country as a means of depriving <span class="highlight">unions</span> of the 35-hour week that they sought. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25)

* But before I come to that let me first emphasise the very real advantages that the system affords <span class="highlight">unions</span>, and quite deliberately so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Firstly, it gives <span class="highlight">unions</span> a monopoly of representation, a powerful weapon indeed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Secondly, it enables <span class="highlight">unions</span> to enforce their own registered rules. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Fourthly, it gives <span class="highlight">unions</span> the capacity to get an official award which represents the minimum conditions applicable to a particular industry and it gives it the force of law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Certainly a number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> have moved in the same direction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* We will also be exploring with management and <span class="highlight">unions</span> means of easing insecurity caused through temporary changes of demand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Is the craft union background and philosophy of Australian <span class="highlight">unions</span> really the best for Australia or could we do better with industry <span class="highlight">unions</span>? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* I might add that in my own investigations I have already made arrangements for wide ranging discussions with both <span class="highlight">unions</span> and management in a number of different industries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* In view of the Minister's own record in this particular matter it was a mark of the degree to which the left wing <span class="highlight">unions</span> can direct the Minister that his earlier proposals forbade the certification of such freely negotiated arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Minister is well aware of the changing power relationship between management and <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* If agreements concerning standard hours of work, for altering rates of wages on grounds fundamentally related to the national economy, for altering minimum wages and annual leave, do not have to go to the Full Bench for certification then clearly <span class="highlight">unions</span> will tend to prefer agreements to awards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Union officials would have no negotiating capacity and we do not believe that to be good for <span class="highlight">unions</span> or for industrial peace. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Minister is going to a very considerable length to see that union officials are properly elected - democratically elected - by their <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* I want to emphasise that while the principle of amalgamation has been accepted because of the large number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia, 65 per cent of all unionists are already in 21 <span class="highlight">unions</span> and amalgamation has, in the past, seemed to take place between the large and not between the smaller <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Furthermore, demarcation disputes, the existence of which has often been given in favour of amalgamation between <span class="highlight">unions</span>, represents only a small percentage of strikes and of lost time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Minister had the left wing communist <span class="highlight">unions</span>, with whom he is normally fairly buddy-buddy, snapping at his heels like an un-Australian terrier, so on this issue his difficulty is understandable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Putting aside the provisions of the earlier Bill relating to penalties, the protection of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and members from civil action, which are to come forward again in a separate Bill, so we are told - I imagine that will come forward after the Senate election - there is no question that the rules are being changed in this Bill to make the lot of the militant unionist easier. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* There are many <span class="highlight">unions</span> and unionists who, having democratically elected their officials, are prepared to support them through to a conclusion on any difficult negotiation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* When average weekly earnings are running at a rate of increase of 13 per cent, as has been acknowledged in the Budget, we can properly ask ourselves whether the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, both blue and white collar, are going to look to the arbitration system to provide their members with an increase in wages sufficient to match that increase in average weekly earnings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* That fact is something that <span class="highlight">unions</span> will be fully aware of in the months ahead. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* We are likely also to see leadership in this field taken over by white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span> rather than blue collar <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* We will see also a movement in the workforce of emphasis away from the blue collar worker to the white collar worker so that blue collar <span class="highlight">unions</span> will become less dominant than the white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span> in their role within the industrial movement in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The machinery that I envisage in this legislation would maintain the role of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and would render conciliation even more significant than it is today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Labour relations code that I referred to should be regarded as a charter of employees' rights in 2 respects - the rights of unionists vis-a-vis their own <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the rights of employees vis-a-vis their employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Minister's endorsement of the pace setter principle for the Public Service, the concept of Hat wage increases, the introduction of a 35-hour working week and the total endorsement of the claims by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the national wage case, have not only been irresponsible but in fact also have been counterproductive against the context of the inflationary spiral which is so rampant throughout Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Fourthly, in genuine industrial disputes between <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers there comes a time when the parties, in the public interest, cannot be left to fight out to the bitter end a war of industrial attrition which could easily seriously undermine the workings of the economy and national stability. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Indeed, it was the result of a disastrous confrontation between <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers in the 1890s that led to the eventual establishment of statutory conciliation and arbitration systems in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The Opposition believes there is a real need for employers and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to face up to the responsibilities demanded of them in a full employment society. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* The use of direct action by <span class="highlight">unions</span> to coerce employers to accede to unreasonable union demand is, of course, not a measure of responsibility. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Responsible action on the part of <span class="highlight">unions</span> calls for submitting only those claims which they feel can be reasonably justified and accompanying those claims with supporting information. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* If we are to retain our present system of annual national wage cases as a method for distributing to workers generally the benefits of economic growth, employers and <span class="highlight">unions</span> need to be careful lest a consequence of their negotiations they exhaust economic capacity to support general wage increases which would normally be awarded as a result of national wage cases. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* I can only agree with the Minister that there are too many <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* In other countries there are far fewer <span class="highlight">unions</span> proportionately than there are in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Haying agreed with that proposition I suggest that the machinery which will resolve that situation and bring more of those <span class="highlight">unions</span> together for the benefit of everybody concerned is important. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* I do not claim to know all the ins and outs but it is possible that if some <span class="highlight">unions</span> were amalgamated into a more united force many disputes would not occur. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Handling and manufacturing techniques are altering and obviously difficulties will arise within the <span class="highlight">unions</span> operating in those areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* They arc really the most difficult disputes to solve because of the internal relationships between the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* They decide the general guidelines that should guide the agreements between particular industries and particular <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* Unfortunately, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> turned him down flat. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* I certainly accept that that is a responsible attitude if we have responsible <span class="highlight">unions</span>, and I hope that we are gradually working towards that end. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* One feature of the Swedish system is that the amalgamation of <span class="highlight">unions</span> is easy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* In our country I do not suppose we will ever get industry <span class="highlight">unions</span> except in isolated cases, such as the Australian Workers Union in the pastoral industry, although even in that case it is not an industry union because wool classers are covered by another union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* It is time the Government not only practised restraint on its own account through the measures I have mentioned through the course of these remarks and established restraint in other sections of the community but also used its links with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> to see that the Builders Labourers Federation cannot get away with its claimed guerilla tactics, to see that the Amalgamated Metalworkers Union will not be successful- [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0)

* I applaud the Waterside Workers Federation for it, and I applaud him for applauding it for what it did, because it is sensible in industrial relations to give credit where credit is due and not always take an institutionalised attitude towards things and simply assume that employers are always wrong or always right, and vice versa in respect of the <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* My proposition is that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> should be prepared to give a firm undertaking that, in return for automatic quarterly cost of living adjustments to the wages of their members to compensate them for price movements as they occur each quarter, they will desist from making claims for wage increases based upon price movements for which they have already received compensation.

* I do not think that a consensus of opinion will arise from the conference which has been convened by  Mr Justice  Moore and which has now been brought forward to August because I think that the employers have taken up a fixed position against quarterly cost of living adjustments and I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> are prepared to give the kind of undertaking that I think would be needed for quarterly cost of living adjustments to be introduced across the board.

* One is that we are not discussing a free market situation in which the price of labour is determined by pure competition; rather is there a cartel situation with <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employer organisations together with important and often decisive outside in fluences, such as government intervention and legal judgments.

* If this forecast is true then the <span class="highlight">unions</span> involved will most certainly provoke further industrial action, an effect hardly consistent with the balance of power argument, advanced by the Minister, which implies that increased unemployment should weaken the position of the <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* With the mechanisation by the ship owners and the many different ways of transporting cargo, people who belonged to <span class="highlight">unions</span> other than the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, were performing tasks which were very similar in nature to those tasks once performed by waterside workers but which, because of the introduction of technology and mechanisation on the waterfront, are now in fact vastly- different tasks.

* Has that union amalgamation really moved towards industrial peace when in the March quarter that union and other metal trades <span class="highlight">unions</span> were principally responsible for the loss of 2 million work days and $37m in wages with 381,000 men being involved?

* With the strength that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> now have, not only in this country but also in other countries of the world, as measured against the power of capital to resist those demands, the sellers of labour are -in the position of living in a buyer's market.

* So we will have to come to accept either quarterly cost of living wage adjustments, whereby wages are adjusted automatically every quarter, or a continuation of the present system under which the strong <span class="highlight">unions</span> especially will not only demand wage increases at regular intervals to take care of price movements that have occurred retrospectively but also will have the industrial muscle necessary to anticipate prospective prices movements and get them.

* There being no automatic arrangements to compensate for wage erosion due to price movements, there remained only one way in which the <span class="highlight">unions</span> could obtain compensation for what had occurred and for anticipated movements in the future, and that was by strike action.

* We will be putting to the Moore conference that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ought to reintroduce quarterly cost of living adjustments and that in return the <span class="highlight">unions</span> ought to give the undertaking that once automatic quarterly cost of living wage adjustments are reintroduced they will not include in any wage demands from then on any element that is related to the movement in prices.

* While the honourable member for Gellibrand was a famed advocate of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, I understand, in previous national wage cases, he is concerned that the consumer price index in a number of areas does not measure the prices which it has the duty of measuring adequately and correctly.

* In my own area on the north coast of New South Wales in the last few weeks there has been a tragic curtailment of services simply because the State Government does not have the funds to do the job and because the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in collusion with the Minister for Transport, who is now at the table, have another plan.

* This Bill relates to the amalgamation of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and is designed quite clearly to make amalgamations much easier than they are at the moment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0)

* These things can be done under cover of an amalgamation arrangement, and at the same time the rights of individual members of a union, an organisation, are further reduced because in relation to those <span class="highlight">unions</span> which have a collegiate system of election, where there is not direct election by the rank and file, the Minister is inserting a provision which states that for 3 years after amalgamation the rank and file members will not get a vote. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0)

* Now under pressure from some <span class="highlight">unions</span> which no doubt wanted this circumstance, the Minister has agreed that the rank and file will not get a vote in relation to those positions in less than 3 years.

* So .5 per cent of total time lost, days lost, does not really appear to represent a major reason for introducing legislation that could do a great deal to run over most of the smaller <span class="highlight">unions</span> in this country.

* This Bill has its thrust in the same direction to establish the circumstances in which a committte of management of a large dominating union, such as the AMWU, can dominate smaller <span class="highlight">unions</span> and can run ever them irrespective of what their members really want. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0)

* But there is quite a different thing in having an amalgamation between small <span class="highlight">unions</span> and having 70 per cent of the membership now in 33 <span class="highlight">unions</span> banded together in 30, 20, 16 or 10 <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Minister, in saying that 300 <span class="highlight">unions</span> is much too many, is putting a gloss on the total situation which is rubbed away when there are 33 <span class="highlight">unions</span> and not 300 <span class="highlight">unions</span> representing 70 per cent of the membership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0)

* The latter could be possible only if the trade union movement itself wished to achieve it, if the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> wished to apply its policy and the Labor Party tried to apply its policy because they all have a similar policy.

* The economic role of the Budget, so far as I can discern it, is this: By embodying the Government's program in the Budget in this way, and by a show of 'soaking the rich' and demonstrating a real concern to redistribute income towards lower income groups- I refer to the tax on unearned income and the capital gains tax, hitting the multi-national mining companies and the fringe benefits of business men, the reduction in the allowable tax deduction for school expensesthe Government will be able to achieve a social contract with the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, that is, achieve wage and salary restraint, an agreement to limit income increases, as the means of countering the current accelerating cost inflation spiral.

* My final observation is that when sufficient individual employers and <span class="highlight">unions</span> give practical application to job re-design programs aimed at bringing the overall quality of working life into line with the quality of life outside the working place, and when more managements recognise that affluence and education have created expectations which cannot be satisfied by traditional systems of work, there will be a better chance of some reduction in the level of wage demand relative to productivity improvement.

* Part of the cost inflation is the rate of average increase in wages and salaries, but we cannot ask the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>- and 1 would defend their position- to oppose any policy that does not equitably distribute the burden of restraint and self-sacrifice in this community and ask those most able to pay to pay most and accordingly distribute this liability fairly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0)

* For instance, it is almost certain that the rules of most Federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> which have State branches registered under State laws are invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0)

* In this legislation we seek not only to correct the problems created by Moore v.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0)

* We believe that, if the rules of the Federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> which have State branches registered as separate entities and whose delegates have attended the governing bodies of the Federal organisation were to be contested, most of them would be struck down as being invalid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0)

* The courts have watered down the general common law ruling- namely, that a decision taken by an improperly constituted body is null and void- by saying: 'Yes, but insofar as this rule relates to the operation of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> it is null and void only to the extent that the bodies concerned are exercising judicial powers and not when they are exercising administrative powers'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0)

* We have decided to refer our judgment in this matter and these remarks to the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth in the hope that it may be possible after consultation between Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General, the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, both Federal and State, and other interested Government authorities to arrange for the examination of the important organisational matters to which we have referred. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0)

* The cases in both State and Federal jurisdictions and the rules of many organisations and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> show that the constitutions of the Federal and the corresponding State body often differ to some extent so that membership of the trade union and the State branch of a Federal organisation, if full use is made of the range of eligibility, must be different.

* Taking one of the most important rules, that specifying the persons eligible for membership, an examination of the position of 24 major <span class="highlight">unions</span> in New South Wales comparing rules of the State registered body with rules of the Federally registered body showed that in all the cases examined there were differences- some small but most great.

* As a carrot, it dangled before the <span class="highlight">unions</span> a specious tax cut, a tax cut so small that by Christmas at the present rate of inflation, the effect and the benefit of the tax cut will have completely and absolutely disappeared.

* No single government any where in the western world- honourable members would admit this in private- can curb or eliminate this economic monster of inflation without using, of course, the old Tory methods of deliberately creating a great army of unemployed, creating tame-cat <span class="highlight">unions</span> and making workers subservient to big business.

* Northern New South Wales is serviced with motor spirit and distillate from the port of Newcastle and industrial disputes in that port covering 7 <span class="highlight">unions</span> have been one of the main reasons for the shortage.

* I thought that, if we made strong representations to the Government, the Government would take this matter up with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to see that some sanity was restored because the adequate supply of motor spirit and distillate is the life blood of country areas and the transport system in Australia.

* The Government sees this measure as being of such importance to the Australian community that we shall welcome any views which any person or organisation including representatives of the insurance industry, women's organisations, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and, of course, the Opposition Parties in this Parliament wishes to place before us, and I foreshadow now that the Government will propose amendments to the Bill during its passage through the Parliament.

* I subscribe to the view of the honourable member for Gellibrand that there will necessarily have to be a lot of co-operation by the 3 areas involved- the employers, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Government- to overcome some of the difficulties that arise because of the obstructionist attitude of the Opposition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0)

* At their meeting 2 weeks ago in Sydney, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> responded positively to the Budget with a declaration which, I regret, has not been published in full in any newspaper throughout Australia and which therefore I seek permission to have incorporated in Hansard.

* The problems involve dual registration and incorporation of <span class="highlight">unions</span> in both the Federal field and in the State field, conflicts which may arise between Federal rules and State rules resulting in people being eligible to join one union but not the other union, a conflict of membership, sometimes a conflict of office bearers and the people who might be constituted properly under the State rules taking decisions in matters that ought to involve Federal rules and therefore the decisions in many cases might well be invalid.

* There are few <span class="highlight">unions</span> that would understand that if the proposals are to be brought to fulfilment, to become effective, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> themselves would have to sign good behaviour bonds and lodge those deeds with the Industrial Registrar saying that they would be prepared to pay any fine or penalty imposed by a State jurisdiction.

* Until we know the reactions of the States, until we know whether they are prepared to legislate in the 9 or 10 areas which are going to be important to them, until we know what the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will do as a result, this Parliament will not know whether the proposals will work.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* I have been advised that the wide amendment then- I am referring to the part of this amendment which relates to trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and not the extension of that part to employer organisations- which virtually made it possible for anyone to be enrolled as a member of a trade union so long as he was involved in the industry, was so wide that it was clearly unconstitutional.

* So this again is the central hinge and if the <span class="highlight">unions</span> were not prepared to co-operate the proposal would fall to the ground. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* The way to do this is not to legislate, to throw down the gauntlet and to say that the States have to follow and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> have to sign this kind of deed but to get agreement beforehand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* I would be delighted to know whether he has had any discussions with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> or any of the significant <span class="highlight">unions</span> about these Sweeney proposals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* By agreement and by voluntary act, Federal branches of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> have to make a commitment to the Commonwealth Industrial Registrar by a deed although there is some doubt whether it is the Commonwealth or State Registrar because the words of the report are certainly ambiguous. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* So the Minister ought to consult with the States and with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and tell this Parliament what the position is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* I hope that the Minister is concerned that the AWU in Queensland, Western Australia and other States as well as other <span class="highlight">unions</span> in a similar position will be allowed to continue to represent those trades that they have represented up to the present time.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words in place thereof: the House is of opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with until the Minister informs the House- (a) whether or not the Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> would accept the conditions for non-incorporated registration of State branches as laid down by the Honourable  Mr Justice  Sweeney and (b) of the position of the States concerning proposed complementary legislation.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* If all the money that has been spent on both the employers' side and <span class="highlight">unions</span>' side had been invested in a conciliation of differences of views, the settlement of disputes and the training of industrial representatives on both sides, the arbitration system in Australia would have been enhanced beyond recognition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* An interesting thought which occurs to me is the actual validity in terms of State registration of State <span class="highlight">unions</span> where union representatives validly enrolled in a federal organisation and not in a State organisation have participated in State union affairs, such as elections, but have not signed the proper application card in that State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* The working party then quoted from the concluding passages of the Industrial Court's judgment as follows: 'When factional differences arise in trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, or when it suits the interest of some litigant or litigants to do so, the Federal of State body can be attacked and its valid operation, its entitlement to assets, funds and membership, imperilled. " [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* A system of trade union organisation is urgently needed which would enable the one body to represent its relevant members in both the Federal and State arbitration systems and it should be possible for Federal and State authorities to examine the question whether organisations and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> can be provided with such a system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* Doubt has now been cast upon this by the honourable member for Wannon.. What is important is that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers who have to make the complex of State and Federal legislation work should have the chance to study it as a whole. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* The position in relation to paragraph ( a) of clause 4 is that the New South Wales industrial arbitration legislation specifically allows State registered <span class="highlight">unions</span> to include in their membership persons who are not employees but who are engaged in work akin to that of employees, for example, owner drivers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* What I hope the Parliament will do, here and in another place, is forget about party politics, forget about the Government and the Opposition, forget about the political advantages that might be gained from hindering the Government and remember that the people who are the prime actors in this business that we are now talking about are the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> on the one hand and the employers on the other. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* It was because the more knowledgeable union officials realised the predicament into which the <span class="highlight">unions</span> have got themselves that they went along with the idea as indeed did the employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* It also recognises that there are a minority of <span class="highlight">unions</span>- very fewwhose position is not clearly covered or encompassed by the section about which we are talking now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* It is one that is absolutely crucial to the question of resolving these minority cases of <span class="highlight">unions</span> whose property position is not fully covered by the section as it is drafted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* This is one of the reasons we felt it reasonable to suggest there should be delay until the House could be informed of the decision of the trade 'union movement and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> that might be intimately involved in this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* The reactions that I have had from a number of <span class="highlight">unions</span> would indicate that there is all the difference in the world between trade union approach in these particular matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* If the rules of <span class="highlight">unions</span> are in as bad shape as the Minister himself has indicated, I think it might be a very difficult practical problem and a difficult legal problem involving a great deal of friction to determine who actually is the present owner.

* The other thing that the Committee must remember is that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> have a year from the time the Bill receives the royal assent in which to get their rules in order. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* The Registrar has never been backward in giving <span class="highlight">unions</span> assistance in bringing their rules into line with amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* The Registrars have been very helpful, as the honourable member for Macquarie points out, and they will continue to be helpful to <span class="highlight">unions</span> in this regard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* If the <span class="highlight">unions</span> cannot get their rules in order within the year that is allowed under the Bill the Registrar still has power to give a further extension of time to them in order that they might do so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* -I think we ought immediately to expose one of the statements by the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  which he made in discussing this clause, clause S. He repeatedly said that this clause will validate certain situations within organisations and <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* It cannot rectify overnight the situation where a group of workers and a group of <span class="highlight">unions</span> desire to form themselves into a State union and to maintain themselves as an autonomous body, not part of the Federal organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* As the debate has just indicated, we know that the provisions of this Act by and large may not be of much importance if they are not underpinned either by the support of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> or by complementary legislation on the part of the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* If the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  looks at the rules of any organisation that has branches registered in a State he will see that the rules of <span class="highlight">unions</span> already provide that the secretary shall be the person who is authorised to sue or to be sued. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* There are some <span class="highlight">unions</span> like the Waterside Workers Federation which for reasons that would be obvious to anyone who understands the industry do not operate and would see no point or future in operating in the State systems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* The other clause to which I would like to refer is clause 11 which seeks to insert new section 142 A giving the Commission power to demark between <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* If that is so, this is again something which requires consultation with the trade union movement because if it were used in the wong way, if it were used in the spirit that the membership of <span class="highlight">unions</span> State by State had to be as nearly the same as possible, if not identical in relation to the trades, callings and jobs which they were representing, clearly the exercise of powers under proposed section 142A coupled with the exercise of the additional powers given to the Registrar in relation to the rules of organisations could lead to a situation in which some <span class="highlight">unions</span> would have their present position completely decimated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* Quite plainly the fact that consultations were held with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> a short while ago is not a substitute for the trade union movement itself understanding what is to happen in relation to this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* I would wonder how many of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> affiliated with the ACTU have seen a Bill, a copy of the report or know what any part of it is about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* That is to say, proposed new section 136a, for instance, requires, as has already been pointed out, certain action on the part of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and certain action on the part of States to give the ground for the implementation of that section. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* This could be achieved by an amendment to clause 2-1 come back to it- to make the whole of the provisions come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation so that after the Bill becomes an Act the consultations can take place with the States, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> can get thenrules in order and the whole matter can then proceed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* -As we are now dealing collectively with a number of clauses I shall deal quickly with some of those that I think require an explanation by the Minister for Labor and Immigration because they refer not only to serious legal questions but also to serious practical consequences for the <span class="highlight">unions</span> who must participate within this jurisdiction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* I would not think that any union would agree to such a contention because in a situation where 2 <span class="highlight">unions</span> have concurrent constitutional coverage over the same calling of workers or within the same industry each is entitled to obtain an award in respect of its own members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* But by virtue of this proposed amendment, one of those <span class="highlight">unions</span> would deny the right to represent its own members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* They referred to there being Federal and State <span class="highlight">unions</span> operating, as it were, within one entity, legal or otherwise, but in one de facto entity known as a national or Federal union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* A system of trade union organisation is urgently needed which would enable the one body to represent its relevant members in both the federal and State arbitration systems and it should be possible for federal and State authorities to examine the question whether organisations and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> can be provided with such a system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* We have heard in this Parliament this afternoon a plea for further delay because some State parliaments, some State governments and some State branches of some <span class="highlight">unions</span> are not yet satisfied that this is an answer to the problem. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* I fail to see that it could be held by the High Court that it is not an industrial dispute within the meaning of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the Australian Constitution when 2 <span class="highlight">unions</span> are seeking to represent the interests of employees and bargain with an employer and there is a stoppage of work and there are counter-demands as between 2 organisations and an employer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* The situation between Federal and State <span class="highlight">unions</span> which the case of Moore v. Doyle highlighted has been with the Australian industrial system since before 1952, as the honourable member for Phillip  (Mr Riordan)  mentioned, and really since the time when the Federal industrial system and the early State industrial systems were established at the turn of the century. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* Both those systems relied for their organisation within Australia on the registration of voluntary groups of workers or employers into a legal entity described under federal legislation as an organisation and under the State legislation which provides for registration of <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* Such people would have federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> right across the board without any State legislation to complicate the issue and to permit the creation of separate and distinct legal entities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* On the other hand, there are those who propound the view that because of the regional characteristics of Australia and the regional characteristics of industry and the work force it is proper that there be a system of State <span class="highlight">unions</span>, that is, a regulation of industrial affairs within a region or State according to the laws of a particular State geared to the particular needs of that region or State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* They saw a need for a means of settling industrial disputes which are national in character by a system of federally organised <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* Some States have chosen a system of registration of <span class="highlight">unions</span>, compulsory arbitration to a more or less degree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* Other States, Victoria amongst them, do not have a system of registration of <span class="highlight">unions</span> or a system of arbitration as States like my own of Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales have. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* But in those States Uke mine, which have a system of conciliation and arbitration, this system has been provided for by the registration of voluntary groups of workers into legally recognised <span class="highlight">unions</span> having a separate legal identity, once they become registered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* As time has gone on, from the days when an award might simply apply to 2 States in order to give it its interstate character, Federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> have sought to extend their industrial power by extending the award coverage which they have beyond the original States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* So, in Western Australia there is the example over many years of Federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> seeking to intrude into the industrial system of that State either by applying for a completely new award which takes in Western Australia for the first time or by way of what is called a roping in award, extending an existing award to Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is a section with which I am most familiar because I fought many cases on behalf of State <span class="highlight">unions</span> before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission seeking to prevent the takeover by a Federal organisation of a State area occupied by a State union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* To me, what this legislation, which has been brought down in an attempt or in a justification of the desire to overcome the difficulties presented by Moore and Doyle, can do is to concentrate power in Federal <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* So, it does not necessarily follow, as the Sweeney report assumes, that a system of Federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia is the best way to bring about industrial peace. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* When we look at the pattern of development in the industrial field in Australia particularly post war, we do see a rapidly accelerating concentration of industrial power in federal <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* I think that if anyone recognising that fact asks himself honestly the question whether there has been more or less industrial peace in Australia post war, under a system of that kind with a concentration of power in Federal <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the answer is ready and at hand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* The Minister for Labour in Western Australia has made inquiries of <span class="highlight">unions</span> in that State and I am informed that the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">unions</span> registered with the State Industrial Commission do not want this BUI. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* The Bill has nothing whatever to do with altering the Act to make it easier for federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> to take over State <span class="highlight">unions</span> or to make it easier for federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> to get federal awards extended to areas to which they are not at present entitled to extend their awards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* The Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> has asked the Government always to send copies of Bills to it and not to all of the organisations affiliated with it so that the ACTU can then consult with its affiliated organisations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0)

* There had never been a problem which bristled so much with legal difficulties as the Moore v. Doyle case produced because the Moore v. Doyle case showed that the law as it now stands, and as it will continue to stand until altered, until cured by the proposal that we are now putting forward, is that the majority of federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> are illegally constituted, that their rules are invalid and that their property is in a state of doubtful ownership.

* The Treasury approach is based on sound- at least they were sound- Keynesian principles, that is, if we reduce purchasing power we reduce demand and therefore we make it more difficult for employers to raise prices, we make employers resist union demands more and we create unemployment and a bad environment for <span class="highlight">unions</span> to seek further wage increases.

* Some relate to the peculiarities of the labour market- the changing nature of the labour market Others are explained by political factors, the political argument being that business and <span class="highlight">unions</span> are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that governments simply cannot maintain restrictive policies for too long because they have to face elections and as a result they are prepared to ride out the rough times.

* In other words, with conditions of substantial unemployment which are increasingly pervading the industrial world at the moment, <span class="highlight">unions</span> have continued to pursue wage claims, but with a determination that would not in the past have existed but which now exists because their bargaining powers are being reduced by unemployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0)

* But if in present circumstances taxes are increased, and if the authors of this book are right, what happens is that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will have a tendency to pursue higher wage claims to get the rate of growth in their after-tax pay that they wanted to achieve.

* If the Minister had one atom of concern for rank and file control over trade union affairs and less concern for the internecine power struggle within the AWU, his old union, and for trying to pay off past debts, he would let these amendments through and let the rank and file members have an influence, and a real influence, in the affairs of their own <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* That does open up opportunities for the larger and more powerful <span class="highlight">unions</span> to subject the smaller organisations, the smaller trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, to takeover tactics which would be just as vigorous and just as ruthless as any takeover tactics that might have occurred in the commercial field between a large company against a smaller company.

* One of the arguments that he and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  have been using over a significant period of time is that since so much of our industrial disputation is concerned with demarcation areas we have to have an amalgamation of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to end the demarcation disputes.

* When amalgamations have occurred, they have in fact been between large <span class="highlight">unions</span>, not between the smaller <span class="highlight">unions</span>, many of which want to maintain their own identity, even if the Minister thinks that is wrong and even recognising, as I and he would, that being too small means that it is very difficult to supply the secretarial services and the research staff that are necessary for the best service.

* I suggest that a majority of <span class="highlight">unions</span> at the present time, as a result of changes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that the Minister has already introduced, do not have rules that are up to date with the present provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* The legislation that was brought in by the last Minister for Labour- I think he was called the Minister for Labour and National Service at that time and I am pleased to see that the present Minister refused to accept that dreadful title - and steam-rollered through this House and the Senate contained provisions which made it virtually impossible for trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to amalgamate.

* There is one other aspect which I think ought to be brought to the attention of the House, and that is the consequences of allowing the greater concentration of union power into fewer and fewer <span class="highlight">unions</span> because this is what inevitably will happen if this Bill is passed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* Obviously what will happen if amalgamation becomes easier is that the big <span class="highlight">unions</span> will amalgamate into even bigger <span class="highlight">unions</span> and increasingly there will be fewer <span class="highlight">unions</span> with immense membership and fantastic incomes running into millions of dollars far beyond their ordinary needs for administration and to serve the industrial interests of their members.

* When we hear members of this Government, particularly members such as the Minister, making an outcry against monopoly power of corporations within commerce and industry in Australia it is little wonder that the public cannot understand why this Government is not concerned about the increasing monopoly power of <span class="highlight">unions</span> within Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0)

* I think it is high time that debate within Australia on this subject is lifted to a much higher level so that the attention of the community is directed to it, and when proposals are put forward by either party for spreading the umbrella of the law over <span class="highlight">unions</span> as well as corporations the true social purpose of those proposals can be seen and it will be appreciated that those proposals will be for the benefit of the community as a whole and will not be simply an instrument or a weapon, nor could they be labelled as such, for union bashing.

* But what the Minister seems not to have realised is that the instructions he gave to the Government's counsel in the wage indexation case before the Arbitration Commission fly in complete and utter defiance of the principles proposed in this legislation because one of the Australian Government's employees stated quite plainly before the Arbitration Commission: 'This is what must happen and if <span class="highlight">unions</span> do not agree with this the Commission must deny their claims'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0)

* The Minister really must try to get into his mind some consistent objective in relation to industrial relations because all he succeeds in doing is confusing not only his own supporters in the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> but also the great bulk of the union movement.

* That may be one of the reasons why the ACTU said that wage restraint, which would seem at one part to have been an integral part of the Government's case in relation to wage indexation, was not in its handbook and that it was a matter for the individual <span class="highlight">unions</span> themselves to determine.

* The decision that the ACTU came to in relation to wage indexation, the determination that there could be no restraint on the part of any trade union, the determination of the white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span> to press forward and to oppose the indexation proposals are all ample evidence of the Minister's tragic wilfulness and determination to go his own way despite the advice of the ACTU and despite the pre-eminent advice of his own Department.

* The reason for this is that there are pressures which are being exerted continuously on members of the ALP but they are being exerted by the elite and this elite is a small coterie which is based more particularly in certain <span class="highlight">unions</span> and more particularly within metropolitan branches.

* As Australia has one of the highest savings rates in the world, and banking legislation which already gives the Government considerable control over liquidity as well as Government loan raising, the Opposition believes that the establishment of the NIF will merely divert existing savings from the well established banking institutions, building societies, unit trusts, credit <span class="highlight">unions</span> and superannuation funds, and will do nothing to create or develop additional savings from the community.

* By its actions in the wider cases before the Commission we will be able to judge whether this legislation really marks a new acceptance by the Government of its national responsibilities or whether it is just a bit of window-dressing, another example of double standards to be applied to a small section of the workforce when the really important economic decisions in matters affecting the nation as a whole will undoubtedly involve numerically large and financially powerful <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* To assist in that purpose, we support the concept of a National Council of Trade Union Education whose task it would be to develop special relationships with the appropriate educational institutions to see that the content of courses specifically met the needs of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* Many trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> have greater resources and facilities than employer associations, and in almost aU cases of confrontation between a trade union and an enterprise, it is the community, the public interest, which suffers from any imbalance of power.

* Without getting involved in an across-the-House debate, I think it is important that there should be a variety of roles for the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to play in the field of education and training and I think it is important to ensure that the Authority takes as neutral a role as possible in the circumstances.

* Firstly, on the subject of an ideological bias all the member for Corangamite was doing was warning that in the eyes of some people the Trade Union Training Authority might have an ideological bias because some of those trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which have been conducting their own programs most clearly have had an ideological bias. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0)

* We also need to make sure that fundamental industrial law is taught, that industrial psychology is at least touched upon and introduced and that management principles will enable union secretaries and other officials to run their <span class="highlight">unions</span> as a business in the interests of thenmembers also will be taught.

* It is one we would applaud, irrespective of whether paid educational leave becomes mandatory, when the concept of paid educational leave becomes sufficiently universal on a voluntary basis; sufficiently widespread that it is appropriate for the employers and government as well as for the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to be in charge of the administration of the program of paid educational leave.

* When the first Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed in 1904, the place of the union was recognised in that Act, and I think that there was a recognition of the need to try to bring <span class="highlight">unions</span> into the arbitration system and also to encourage people to become members of <span class="highlight">unions</span> because for our arbitration and conciliation system to function it is essential that people be encouraged to join <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* Depite the more liberal approaches of the 2 previous speakers on the Opposition side, the honourable member for Balaclava  (Mr Macphee)  and the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street),  I cannot say that the Liberal and Country Party record in this field in the past has been one which would give the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> much cause to be very pleased with the attitudes adopted by those parties.

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> did resist this and as we are all aware there was quite a lot of industrial disputation at that time, but finally the confrontation did come in 1969 when I think that the then Liberal Government realised that it was going to get nowhere by using the big stick against the <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0)

* Since the amalgamation of the various metal <span class="highlight">unions</span> the AMWU has become a fairly large union and because it is fairly large it probably has greater resources and can make much more use of those resources.

* When one speaks with the officers of the various white collar <span class="highlight">unions</span> that speak for public servants on these matters one finds that they are almost united and speak with almost one voice on one aspect of this matter; that is, that if the amendments in the form that they have come to us from the Senate were to be accepted their acceptance would cause an even greater amount of inequity and place an even greater financial burden on public servants than the present scheme casts upon them- the present scheme that the Government knows to be wrong and wants to change and that the Opposition knows to be wrong but, speaking with 2 voices, finds a reason for opposing.

* The left wing <span class="highlight">unions</span>- the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  would know a bit more about them than I do- and those under straight out communist control can be relied upon for only one thing, and that is using any political pretext to cause dissension and trouble throughout industry.

* For a long time now, ever since the Whybrow and Co. case, there have been many instances of case law which have indicated that one of the great weaknesses in industrial relations has been the fact that <span class="highlight">unions</span> have to serve logs of claims on employers that would keep them within ambit during the currency of the proposed award; that is to say, if there is a possibility that during the currency of the award there will be a rapid increase in wages or there will be a change in working conditions or standard hours or annual leave, the union has to make certain that the log of claims that it serves will be anticipating at least the standard of wages and working conditions which might ultimately come about before the award expires. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* This means that <span class="highlight">unions</span>, in accordance with the case law as it now stands, have to serve claims which contain seemingly extravagant demands in relation to wages and working hours and working conditions, otherwise they would have to go to the expense of reserving all of the employers bound by that particular award.

* Just before I was sacked as Minister for Labor and Immigration I was working on a regulation that would allow substituted service for logs of claims so that <span class="highlight">unions</span> could make claims that were more realistic, by servicing, say, the association of the employers concerned only and that copies of the log of claims could then be published in the Government  Gazette. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* I appeal to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to give very serious consideration to the regulation I was considering during the first half of last year; that is to say, issue a regulation which will authorise <span class="highlight">unions</span> to service by substituted service on employers instead of having to serve all of the employers, as is now the case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* The trouble has been that because the High Court's ruling has made <span class="highlight">unions</span> keep within the ambit of the original log of claims before subsequent variations to the award can be tolerated or entertained by the Commission, <span class="highlight">unions</span> have had to anticipate in advance; they have had to set claims that were quite unrealistic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* The Minister can strike a very important blow for sensible industrial relations if he will take up where I left off, consider issuing regulations which will make it possible to serve logs of claims on, say, a nominal number of respondents- perhaps the original association of employers which is appropriate to cover the employers that you wish to cover by the log of claims- and then allow the <span class="highlight">unions</span> by substituted service to cover the rest of the employers by notification through the Government  Gazette.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* The honourable member suggested that these costs were so high that <span class="highlight">unions</span> endeavoured to incur the costs as seldom as possible and therefore had to pitch their claims a long way ahead into the future, trying to gauge what working conditions and wages might be at some considerable time into the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* The honourable member has suggested that perhaps another way could be found to serve logs of claims which would avoid this cost, avoid the necessity for <span class="highlight">unions</span> to make such a large demand at any one time and so reduce the expectations in the minds of union members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0)

* As I understand him he suggested that logs of claims might be served by way of substitute service by being published in the Commonwealth  Gazette,  that because this would be a great deal cheaper <span class="highlight">unions</span> would be able to serve logs of claims without incurring those huge costs, that they would be willing to do it more often and would therefore moderate the sorts of claims that were made.

* What I am saying is that in this day and age of large <span class="highlight">unions</span> determining wages and large corporations determining prices it is counterproductive to think that we can get an economy like ours moving again in this way after the drastic slump brought about almost entirely by world conditions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  in his second reading speech informed us that the Government did not intend to proclaim the legislation, other than in respect of the quite minor aspect of providing for the appointment of an additional judge to the Industrial Court, pending discussions with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> on the state of the economy, and on wages policy in particular. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* But the fact that the Government is demanding that this legislation be debated and passed through the Parliament before those discussions are held surely must be taken as evidence that it holds little hope of reaching any substantial agreement with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> on wages policy.

* Accordingly, the fact that the legislation is being pushed through now can only lead us to assume that the Government is quite pessimistic about reaching such agreement with the unionsand well might it be pessimistic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is difficult to believe that this decision could provide a basis for agreement on wages between the Government and <span class="highlight">unions</span> though that may not have been possible had the plateau been set at a higher level, say, at the level of average weekly earnings which are about $165 a week. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* Nor is there much chance that the Government's recently announced fiscal measures would encourage the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to accept reduced real wages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is difficult to see therefore that there is much chance of agreement with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> arising from the scheduled discussions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* Indeed, the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> Executive has already described the fiscal measures as unacceptable and as having an anti-working class bias. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* In those circumstances the Government intends by this legislation to attempt to impose its will on the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Commission by substantially increasing its role and influence in the wage determination process. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* The Government apparently would then rely on unemployment and /or restoration of penalties on <span class="highlight">unions</span> to ensure that wage increases granted outside the Commission's guidelines did not restore wages to their previous level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* Everyone knows that this legislation is aimed at trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in general and some trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> in particular, and especially one trade union, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* Of course absentee voting is by postal ballot so the legislation currently requires all <span class="highlight">unions</span> which hold secret ballots by the use of polling booths also to make provision for secret postal voting for those who want to vote absentee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* So it is beyond doubt that there is increasing usage of this form of election by <span class="highlight">unions</span> over recent years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* They have made many <span class="highlight">unions</span> consider holding such elections through the Industrial Registrar because in this type of election the Government pays the cost of holding the election. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* However, the Government appears to have made 2 concessions: One is to allow those <span class="highlight">unions</span> whose rules provide for a form of voting that is likely to achieve a higher participation rate than a secret postal ballot to retain that form of voting. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* The Government has made the further concession to the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> could run their own ballots as long at they remained secret postal ballots. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* It would therefore have been possible, it seemed to us, for <span class="highlight">unions</span> to conduct elections simply by running a postal ballot in which all who wanted to vote would apply to the returning officer for a form in much the same way as absentee voting is conducted under the current Act.

* In these days when we talk increasingly of a social contract in industrial relations, of arriving at some general agreement between government and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> on what should be the general level of wage increases in the community, of what could be the total package in terms of things like taxation measures, tax indexation, wage increases and various economic measures that might be introduced, it is even more necessary that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be required to take into account matters of direct relevance to the economy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* As a result of the Government's initiatives, the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> has agreed to take part in wide-ranging discussions with the Government on the state of the economy, with particular emphasis on wages policies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* I am happy to leave it up to the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to decide which system they want, but I do believe that a form of collegiate voting, as it is called, ought to be open to <span class="highlight">unions</span> to apply if they so wish. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0)

* I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, by referring to the decision of the Arbitration Commission last week to adopt one of the Government's options in implementing a system of wage indexation based upon the plateau of Average Award Rates for adult males- a principle in line with the application of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> in the parent case in 1 974. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-11-0)

* -The honourable member for Hindmarsh is quite correct in saying that the decision of the Full Bench on the national wage case last week followed closely the submissions of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> in 1974. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-11-0)

* It seems to me that the cost of the secret postal ballots will eventually become prohibitive on the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and that, in essence, we will reach the situation where the <span class="highlight">unions</span> themselves will ask for the Commonwealth to take over the cost by providing a court controlled ballot system in practically every case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* I compliment the Minister- I adopt what the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  said about the Minister's work, and in fact I respectfully suggest that he is considerably over-worked- that instead of taking a stock whip to the <span class="highlight">unions</span> he has said that we will have a trial period of 2 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* From this compromise and others I believe may well emerge a social compact, if I may use that phrase which is not viewed very favourably in this country, of co-operation at a tripartite level between government, employers and <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* I believe that the cost of secret postal ballots will become prohibitive for <span class="highlight">unions</span> and that eventually, rather than by coercion, by cooperation we will have reached a position in which the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will have asked the Court to take control of their elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* I say quite frankly and openly that whilst this matter has caused me considerable trouble, I believe that <span class="highlight">unions</span> which possess at present the collegiate system of voting should be given the right and the protection of this Government to continue their system of collegiate voting. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* I put as a natural extension of the federalist philosophy which I adopt the argument that, in my opinion at any rate, if the collegiate system is taken away the smaller States can say goodbye to any chance of having an effective role to play in the election of federal office bearers of their <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* I contend, with respect, that where the collegiate system has been utilised by many <span class="highlight">unions</span> in this countrywhether honourable members opposite agree with it or not- it would be wrong for this Government to legislate in any way, shape or form, to take it away. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* It is ironic that the Government which now sits on the Treasury benches was elected to government because it told the Australian people, and in particular the 5 250 000 employees in the work force: 'If you vote for us we will hand control of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> back to the members.

* Where we differ is that under the Labor Party's platform and under the Labor Party's legislation those <span class="highlight">unions</span> which had the collegiate system as at that date were to be given 3 years in which to bring their rules into line with the legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28)

* The legislation makes it clear that <span class="highlight">unions</span> that had the collegiate system then had the right to continue the collegiate system  ad infinitum  except that those federal positions within the union that were full time jobs and the holder of which was a member of the management committee of the organisation, had to go to the rank and file for election.

* I want to point out- I think this should be on the record of the Parliament- that this proposal for postal ballots, if <span class="highlight">unions</span> generally accept the provision that elections be conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, will cost the Commonwealth government something like $1.5m a year on the estimates that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  has put forward in a submission to Cabinet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* In the last few years there has been an increasing tendency for trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to adopt court controlled ballots for reasons which I think have much to do with the increasing cost of conducting elections themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> can please themselves whether they have the election conducted by the Australian Electoral Office or do it themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* The point is that this kind of election was increasingly the kind of election which <span class="highlight">unions</span> were adopting anyway. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* In fact, in the last year or so <span class="highlight">unions</span> which intended to conduct elections in this way decided not to do so because they did not want to look as though they were being forced into doing so by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* Generally speaking the trend for court controlled ballots was developing and the Government is simply doing no more than forcing some few <span class="highlight">unions</span> which did not want to conduct ballots in this manner into doing so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* In relation to what the Government sees as a exercise in taming the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, it is my view, having been a participant in union ballots conducted both by returning officers of the union and by the Australian Electoral Office, that what the Government has set out to do will not be achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* The honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  referred to the fact that last year 29 <span class="highlight">unions</span> applied for ballots to be conducted under section 170. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* He made the point that, as 3 years is not an unusual term of office, therefore approximately 50 <span class="highlight">unions</span> a year are involved in elections. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* Nevertheless, I will make inquiries to find out what percentage of <span class="highlight">unions</span> holding elections in that year asked for them to be conducted under section 170. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* As a matter of fact, for the 29 <span class="highlight">unions</span> referred to earlier the average return of ballot papers was just under 40 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35)

* As a first step, we are seeking to list the problems related to this industry in the agenda of matters that could be discussed with the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and see what efforts might be made and what undertakings might be entered into to help lower costs, increase productivity and establish the circumstance in which a viable industry in Australia could continue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0)

* There can be no guarantee of it at this stage, because the extent of the change would need to be significant, but this may well be an opportunity where firm commitments entered into by the <span class="highlight">unions</span> concerned, backed by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, would enable a significant and important Australian industry to be saved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0)

* Let us look at the effects of this in terms of tax claw-back and the result it will have on the gross claim the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will make for increased wages to offset the cost of Medibank and private health insurance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0)

* In the case of the celling amount of $300 a year- a contribution of nearly $6 a week- this will represent the <span class="highlight">unions</span> seeking an increase in wages of about $9 a week which will be required before tax to offset the effect of the Medibank levy.

* This is demonstrated by the fact that when the industrial registrar called to his office members of those <span class="highlight">unions</span> which had not amended their rules to meet the 1973 requirements- about the middle of this year- the Federal  president  of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia,  Mr Maynes,  asserted that he did not believe that it would be necessary to amend his rules because the Government would amend the Act to allow the retention of the collegiate system.

* Nonetheless, it is difficult to conclude other than that the Government has been greatly influenced in bringing down this legislation by the National Civic Council controlled <span class="highlight">unions</span> such as the Federated Clerks Union and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association in which <span class="highlight">unions</span> the collegiate system enables a minority group to establish control. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0)

* To me it is crystal clear that this Government has 'done a deal' with the Santamaria/National Civic Council group and has 'sold-out' thousands of Australian unionists who saw, in the pre-election industrial promises of this Government, an opportunity to place their own acceptance or rejection on whom would be the Federal Officials of a number of Australian trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0)

* A further unsavoury aspect of this legislation which should also be mentioned is the change in the definition of 'office ' which will enable <span class="highlight">unions</span> to appoint persons to positions in the union which are similar to elected positions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0)

* Earlier this year the Government promised the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations that it would consult them in relation to any legislation it intended to introduce to change the 1973 legislation.

* In discussion today it became quite clear that the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> wanted a national conference on a very much broader range of issues, not giving any commitment on what might come out of it one way or the other. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-12-0)

* He is stating that if there are tax cuts fully equivalent to the increase in wages that would flow through from 100 per cent indexation- that is what it is saying- the ACTU on its part, but only then, would be prepared to convene a special federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> conference to consider the forgoing of the March quarter application on that basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-12-0)

* Quite plainly what  Mr Hawke  was proposing is that if there is a national conference and depending on the Government making certain commitment about tax cuts the ACTU would then consider calling a conference of its <span class="highlight">unions</span> to decide what it would do as a result of that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-12-0)

* I will look forward to hearing from those Premiers under the honourable gentleman's influence or under the influence of the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and  President  of the Australian Labor Party, to find out by how much the Premiers of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania will be prepared in line with their advocacy of tax cuts to forgo revenue normally due to them.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0)

* So far, the only suggestion from the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, for example, is that there ought to be a Commonwealth tax cut, in return for which it would consider calling a further conference of its own. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-3-0)

* In spite of the fact that we tried on a number of occasions to achieve either a commitment on behalf of organisations, or, if that was not possible, a personal commitment in principle in line with the objectives of the heads of government agreement, we were not able to obtain that commitment from members of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> or from the majority of the other people at the discussion that took place yesterday. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-3-0)

* -I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the fact that prices are determined by employers and wages are determined by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and employers, exactly how much say will trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> have in the wage-price freeze? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0)

* Will the Federal Government approach the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and if so when, to try to preserve the wage-price halt agreed to last week by the heads of government and rejected yesterday by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and other official union bodies? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-13-0)

* However, to talk in terms of the absolute cost of protection as being $184m annually is just as dangerous as the <span class="highlight">unions</span> stating that the $100m profit of the Broken Hill Pty Co.

* But in any case honourable members can rest assured that the Federal Department of Health, after consultation with Federal and State government departments, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, trades and labour councils, the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and mining Companies, has developed the world's most stringent code to govern the mining and milling of uraniumshould the Government give permission for mining to commence- subject to receiving the second Fox report.

* One of the interesting things about the proposition of the Transport Workers Union- it may well explain the incapacity of the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> to embrace even the objectives and principles of the wage-price halt- is the President's incapacity to do anything about it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-14-0)

* I think it is a condemnation of his leadership of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> that 230 people are able to put at risk not only the services in the State of Victoria but obviously the jobs of tens of thousands of people in that State. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-14-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0)

* Mr Hawke  has demonstrated his utter incapacity not only to represent those members in the trade union movement who vote for the Liberal Party or National Country Party- that is, about 40 per cent of them- but also to serve the interests of the trade union movement in a bipartisan manner and a manner that ought to befit the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0)

* My speech dealt with penal provisions of legislation directed against trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#debate-20)

* But that Premiers Conference was transformed by the throwing into the ring of the concept of a price-wage freeze by the Premier of Victoria, who called for a national conference of governments, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employer organisations to consider such a freeze. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* There was no possibility of agreement unless the Government could assure the <span class="highlight">unions</span> that there would be an effective price freeze. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* How could the <span class="highlight">unions</span> be expected to agree to a wage freeze when there was no guarantee that there would be an effective price freeze, which the Government has never been in a position to guarantee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* So in the period of the proposed wage freeze there would be substantial recorded price increases, which of course would make it more difficult for <span class="highlight">unions</span> to accept the wage freeze. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* So it was unlikely that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> would accept any further real wage cuts such as would be involved in a price and wage freeze because of the non-adjustment for the March quarter, meaning that real wages would .be reduced until at least the March quarter figures were looked at by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in August when, after the freeze had ended, it considered them at the same time as it considered the June quarter figures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* The ACTU called for such a conference in a hearing before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission a week ago and said that in such a conference consideration should be given to tax cuts as an offset to <span class="highlight">unions</span> forgoing the March quarter increase so that there would not be a further fall in real after-tax wages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* Clearly that was a very important issue for the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* The Arbitration Commission commended the idea, but the Government dismissed it out of hand on the flimsy excuse that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> would not agree in principle to a price-wage freeze. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* The Government must have known that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> could not agree in principle to something which was vague, ill-defined, and beset with considerable problems until those problems had been discussed and analysed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* He said on television last week that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> can get wage increases outside the Arbitration Commission and therefore the fact that he is asking the Commission to freeze award wages does not mean that he is trying to impose a compulsory wage freeze. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* In fact, in the oil industry dispute, as I am sure all honourable members are aware, the Government is pressuring the oil companies, and has been doing so for some time, not to concede one cent to the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in the negotiations which have now broken down and led to the prolonged strike. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* It is interested in confronting the <span class="highlight">unions</span>, in slashing real wages, and in the process bringing about substantial industrial disputation, therefore justifying the industrial relations legislation which has already been introduced into this House, and the trade practices legislation, which if implemented, will have similar effects on the ability of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to take industrial action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* What was involved in that and what we must constantly remind ourselves of, despite the attempts of people such as the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> to divert our attention from it, was the simple proposition that the Australian people understood that it was fair to have a price pause in return for a wage pause. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0)

* To the extent that the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, his colleagues and members of the Opposition have denigrated the cause of reaching agreement on a price-wage pause, they have denied themselves an opportunity of participating in a means of making sure that the agreement worked.

* In view of the fact that the only hope of implementing a price-wage freeze is by gaining the co-operation of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, and because of the fact that  Mr Hawke,  whatever his political colour or motives were, was at that time trying to mediate in the crippling Victorian petrol crisis, can the Prime Minister tell me in all seriousness why he chose yesterday to make his attacks and how those attacks will help to bring about closer relations between the Government and the trade union movement?

* I am not making criticism for the sake of criticism, but what worries me about the Government's policy- and I am making a genuine query of what I think is undesirable- is this: I can understand the Government responding in this way because I think that a habit of mind has developed in teachers' <span class="highlight">unions</span>, in the media and in the State governments which would lead a government to defend itself.

* In our view the fact that certain union action has the effect of restricting competition is no reason to include <span class="highlight">unions</span> under trade practices legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* This legislation nominally seeks to control the activities of employees and <span class="highlight">unions</span> in respect of secondary boycotts, which is a term that is not defined in the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* The criticisms that we made of that Bill were never answered in this House, but subsequently the Government has had detailed discussions with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and we now have a considerably altered proposed section 45D before us which, I might say, is in no way approved by the <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* Whether federally registered <span class="highlight">unions</span> are bodies corporate for the purposes of this Act is not clear, but there is a good chance that that would be the case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* In Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia the State registered <span class="highlight">unions</span> are clearly bodies corporate and likely to be considered as such for the purposes of this Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* But even if a union can escape being roped in as ' a person ' the Bill still seeks to ensure that <span class="highlight">unions</span> are ensnared by proposed sub-sections (5) and (6). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* Now, however, <span class="highlight">unions</span> are to be directly and specifically implicated in section 45D and if found liable will be faced with an horrific array of penalties involving $250,000 fines, injunctions and civil actions for damages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* As we read this proposed section now it is much more direct in its concern to catch <span class="highlight">unions</span> than were the previous amendments but, on the other hand, less concerned to penalise individuals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* Thus up to approximately 10 per cent of industrial disputes, which are demarcation disputes- a very substantial element- are not protected from the trade practices legislation and <span class="highlight">unions</span> engaging in them being involved with the possibility of massive fines and penalties under this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* Doubtless, many honourable members opposite think it is a great idea to bash <span class="highlight">unions</span> for these sorts of activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* It appears to us to be the case that proposed sub-section (3), which contains the exclusionary provisions, provides no protection at all to <span class="highlight">unions</span> as such. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* Unless the Government introduces an amendment in the Committee stage it will pass something which will mean <span class="highlight">unions</span> will be totally unprotected against the trade practices legislation in respect of any industrial activity which has the effect of causing damage to a corporation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* <span class="highlight">Unions</span> will also have an avenue open to them to avoid breach of the Act which was not available before, and that is through the process of authorisation procedures under proposed section 88 (7). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* The legislation also seems to extend the liability of <span class="highlight">unions</span> beyond the limits now set by the common law. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* But in recent years there has been increasing use of common law actions against <span class="highlight">unions</span> and it is my advice that actions which are now defendable at common law are likely to be in breach of the law if this legislation is passed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* Further, I mentioned that the Opposition's main spokesman directed his attention exclusively to proposed section 45D and said that it provided severe implications for trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* He relied heavily on the reference to actions by <span class="highlight">unions</span> which interpretation of the new legislation would mean were disruptive and could be dealt with under the various subsections of section 45D on the basis of past record being directly related to union efforts for industrial gain. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* Despite the crocodile tears of the honourable member for Gellibrand, who said that the legislation would have a drastic effect on the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and that as a result of the actions of the Government there was not proper provision for adequate consultation with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> about the legislation, he must admit on the facts that proposed section 45D provides a very evenhanded approach to this important and crucial aspect of trade practices in this country.

* Let us not insist that in some way that they have been canvassed in the Swanson report, in the response by the Trade Practices Commission to that report or, in fact, in the submissions that have been made by interested parties, business houses, trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and consumer organisations, both to the Swanson Committee and to the Government subsequent to the publication of the Swanson Committee report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* I believe that the Government, when it confronted the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> about its first proposed section 45D, was able to give the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> 4 instances of the sort of conduct it thought was reprehensible and ought to be proscribed by that proposed section. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* I realise that to the extent that it affects collective boycotts, it is to the advantage of certain organisations such as trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which could never be taken to be in competition with other organisations in the market place.

* The Bill proposes that the Council comprise 1 6 members: The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, who shall be the Chairman; the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations; 1 member chosen by the Minister to represent public authorities as employers; 6 members nominated by the National Employers' Policy Committee; 6 members nominated by the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>; and 1 member nominated by the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations.

* Only last week, we had the example of  Mr Fraser  hedging on an agreement made between his Government and the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> regarding the proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* These amendments, in the form of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1977, particularly section 45d of that Bill and other industrially significant amendments such as 4b (1) and (2), represent a despicable attempt to impose on the Australian trade union movement restrictions on the freedom to take industrial action, which has historically been the right of the Australian work force, and which is guaranteed by International Labour Organisations conventions, ratified by the Australian Government, to <span class="highlight">unions</span> and associations of workers throughout the free world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* In fact, and in law, proposed new section 45d would make any form of industrial activity illegal and punishable by massive fines on individual employees and <span class="highlight">unions</span>, plus providing for separate actions in the courts for damages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* Secondly, any attempt to resort to action which free trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> all over the world are able to use, could expose individuals and <span class="highlight">unions</span> to fines imposed by the Federal Court of Australia of up to $50,000 for individuals and up to $250,000 for <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* Fifthly, apart from crippling fines for the action, <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their members would face damages cases by which employers or individuals could recover what they claimed to have lost in the dispute. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* If this Bill is allowed to be passed without revision, then <span class="highlight">unions</span> will be returned to the intolerable position they occupied in mid- 19th century England when they could in theory organise but were denied the power to use their organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* Quite simply the <span class="highlight">unions</span> cannot afford to accept this legislation because it will mean a sellout of what the Australian trade union movement stands for and what it has fought for for over a century. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* It is quite clear that  Mr Apap  had, in fact, banned deliveries to the Wills company because he could not get people employed by that company who were apparently members of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the Federated Clerks Union and probably other <span class="highlight">unions</span> to join his union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44)

* It appears that because they were happy as members of those <span class="highlight">unions</span> and did not want to join his union he considered that he would attempt to put G. and R.

* One can immediately see why executive members of some <span class="highlight">unions</span> have publicly come out against this proposed section when the likes of  Mr Apap,  by what appears to be totally irresponsible action, apparently cause completely false information to be published and, further, through bans, withhold supplies to a business just because  Mr Apap  was trying to convince members of one union to leave and join his union.

* It is an interesting concept that under trade practices legislation, founded on the issue that the Government now has some constitutional power to deal with corporations and therefore that <span class="highlight">unions</span> become part and parcel of the corporation power, the Government has decided to bring in this confrontation legislation.

* As the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> said, the changes that have taken place concerning the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Justification Tribunal do in certain respects expose the double standards adopted by this Government in relation to both sides of the business world- the employers and the employees.

* I said at the second reading stage that we regard the definition of 'employee' as being substantially adverse to the ability of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to encompass persons who may well wish to be members of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> but who would have been unable to be so, particularly in the States of Victoria and Tasmania, if the Government had proceeded with this new definition.

* All that has ever been said by <span class="highlight">unions</span> when they enrol members- this has been substantiated by decisions of the courts over the years- is: 'Look at the benefits that you enjoy, the wages that you collect, the leave provisions and all the rest of the things that have been won by people acting in concert with one another'.

* If we are to have an orderly society, it ought to be built on the basis that we in this national Parliament recognise that trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> exist, we want to promote goodwill in industry, we want to encourage the means by which we can settle disputes, we want to provide the means for the settlement of those disputes and we want to encourage the organisation of representative bodies of employers and employees.

* This would mean in effect that not only would there be a duty on a body such as the Bureau, which will take the place of the Inspectorate to be repealed by clause 1 8, but also that the Bureau would have the power, obligation and duty to launch prosecutions against <span class="highlight">unions</span> for breaches of bans clauses.

* The fact is that by the abolition of the Inspectorate and the abolition of ministerial control factor we are giving the Bureau far more power than the Inspectorate had thus creating a quite different situation and, as I said, breaching the agreement the Government reached with the <span class="highlight">unions</span>.

* In our view the fact that there has been this breach and that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> will see it as a serious breach means in effect that the Government will have a massive industrial relations problem on its hands. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* The agreement will be virtually torn up and we will be back to the situation where the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> on 4 May threatened massive economic dislocation of the country if the Government went ahead with these measures. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* Let us reflect that on Tuesday 17 May, 5 senior Ministers of the Fraser Government met with the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>,  Mr Hawke,  and agreed to accept his proposals that the Government establish the Industrial Relations Bureau without increasing existing powers and legal obligations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and that the National Labour Advisory Council be reconstituted on a statutory basis. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* Two days after this agreement had been reached, and imminent industrial warfare had been averted, at least for the time being, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made statements about the proposed role of the Industrial Relations Bureau which immediately placed the fragile agreement between the Government and the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in jeopardy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* Commenting on the intended powers of the Industrial Relations Bureau the Prime Minister stated that the IRB would still be able independently to initiate prosecutions of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* These comments were notoriously contrary to the assurances on the IRB's powers which were given by  Mr Street  and the other senior Cabinet Ministers just 2 days beforehand and which formed the basis for the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> decision to accept the IRB legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* Then, on the same day, another senior Government Minister, a man well known to share the Prime Minister's rigid and despotic anti-union sentiments- the Minister for Primary Industry,  Mr Sinclair-  was reported to have stated that legislation to be brought before Parliament in the next week- that is today- would extend the protection available against trade union excesses and that the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> had accepted these new procedures and constraints. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* No doubt the <span class="highlight">unions</span> are now wondering why in the first place they ever trusted the Fraser Government to keep an agreement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* With the overwhelming support of the trade union movement he had made a genuine attempt to avoid a bitter and disastrous confrontation between the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* I hope that when the time comes he will carry out the promise he made to the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* The Act makes it clear that trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> have to keep proper records of their financial transactions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* If I were the Minister I would say to my inspectorate if it was handling the matter: 'Not only do I want you to get right after this particular union but also I want you to get the best counsel you can, take the union to the Industrial Court and tell the court to impose the maximum penalty in order that its decision will be a deterrent against other <span class="highlight">unions</span> breaking the Act in the same way'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23)

* In my second reading speech I stated the Government's view that there was a need for time to be given not only for members of Parliament to give the proposed legislation their objective consideration but also for the principal parties to industrial relations- the peak councils of the employer organisations and trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, individual trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers and the community at large- to examine the contents of the Bill and to be able to make their views known to the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* I subsequently invited representatives of the national employers and, through the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, representatives of peak union councils to meet with me separately to discuss the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> indicated their strong opposition to many of the Government's proposed amendments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* However, at the end of the discussions, the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, with the support of the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations, provided me with a written statement which included:   we put two propositions for the earnest consideration of the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The Government has given very serious consideration to the views and proposals put by both <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* In the light of the positive response to this statement by the conference of federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> convened by the ACTU, and the national employers' views, the Government now proposes that the current Bill provide, together with some machinery amendments, simply for the establishment of an industrial relations bureau. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* A Bill to establish a reconstituted national tripartite consultative council has already been introduced into this House and I will be proceeding to move the necessary amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1977 to give effect to the agreement reached with <span class="highlight">unions</span> and employers for the establishment of an Industrial Relations Bureau. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* We oppose the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill because we regard it, in its original form- in the form in which it is now before the House- as a totally repugnant piece of legislation that is aimed at reducing the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in this country to a state of industrial impotence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* After this Bill was first put before the Parliament it was considered by the Executive of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and that body passed a resolution threatening massive dislocation of the economic life of the nation if this legislation were proceeded with. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* We also have had the introduction of legislation designed drastically to affect the operations of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, namely the Trade Practices Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* Though that legislation has been changed many times, in the form in which it has now passed through the House of Representatives it is still a very severe inhibition upon the ability of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> to operate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* It will cover a very substantial amount of industrial activity and lay <span class="highlight">unions</span> open to very substantial penalties indeed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* In that situation the <span class="highlight">unions</span> were then faced with a Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that in many respects would have reduced them to a state of total impotence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* In brief, the legislation would have had the effect upon <span class="highlight">unions</span> of weakening them numerically and financially, of fostering dissension within their ranks, of destroying their bargaining power and of subjecting them to harassment and interference by an industrial police force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* Firstly, in relation to weakening the <span class="highlight">unions</span> numerically and financially by facilitating and encouraging non-unionism, it was going to do this by allowing conscientious objection to being a union member to be claimed by an employee for any reason. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* That would have meant in the case of weak <span class="highlight">unions</span> in particular a very substantial possibility that they would have lost a vast number of their membership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* They were making sure there was an inducement and encouragement for people to get out of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and they also prohibited some persons from being members of <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* Of course, if the numerical strength of <span class="highlight">unions</span> was to be weakened, so too was their financial strength. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The second important way in which this Bill sought to undermine trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> was in relation to weakening the solidarity of <span class="highlight">unions</span> through encouraging dissident members to undermine union action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The third way in which the Bill sought to attack the <span class="highlight">unions</span> was by emasculating their bargaining strength in industrial disputes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* First, it did it by providing the Bureau with the power to notify the registrar of the contravention of a bans clause in an award thereby initiating procedures by which <span class="highlight">unions</span> may be fined for engaging in strikes or other industrial action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* What the Government was doing through this provision was changing the process so that the government agency, the Industrial Relations Bureau, would be able to recommence the process of imposing penalties on <span class="highlight">unions</span> for engaging in industrial action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* May I say in relation to those penal clauses for breach of a bans clause, that in the period 1957 to 1969, which was the key period in which they were effective, the <span class="highlight">unions</span> were fined more than $280,000 in this country plus costs which would have amounted to a similar sum, whilst the employees were fined just over $2,000. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* He would not have been obliged- he still will not be obliged by the amended Bill- to have regard to objectives laid down in the current Act such as promoting goodwill in industry, encouraging conciliation, providing for the means of settling disputes or encouraging the organisation of employees into trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* It was opposed not only by the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the Australian Labor Party, but also by the employers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* For example, where a firm does not take action against <span class="highlight">unions</span> under the present legislation due to the fear of union reprisals, it is unlikely to welcome IRB action which will provoke the same union reaction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The Government is facing the prospect of a boycott by Federal Public Service <span class="highlight">unions</span> over the move to establish an Industrial Relations Bureau. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The Bureau, like the Inspectorate, will have the power to prosecute <span class="highlight">unions</span> for breach of a bans clause and to prosecute employees for breaches of the Act such as incitement to strike. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The <span class="highlight">unions</span> will surely regard that as a breach of the agreement, and I do not know where that leaves us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* We object to the Bureau, whether the agreement is complied with entirely or not, but I hope that if the Government is not going to scrap the Bureau it will at least make sure that the Bureau is subject to the same powers and processes which it agreed with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in the first place would be the case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The honourable member for Gellibrand did not discuss the agreement with the ACTU until the last few minutes of his speech, but he did say that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the employers were totally opposed to the legislation introduced into this House by the Minister a few weeks ago.

* We have a situation in which, if a large union or group of <span class="highlight">unions</span> is ranged against one of the smaller to medium sized businesses, the balance of economic and industrial power is very strongly on the side of the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* The second trend which I think is of concern and which ought to be looked at in connection with this debate is the growth in the size of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their involvement in a wider range of issues than purely industrial issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* This points up the fact that, because of the size of <span class="highlight">unions</span> and their involvement in an increasing range of non-industrial areas, individual rights can be in jeopardy and they need further protection than is provided under existing legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* Because of the agreement with the trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> which the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has reached on behalf of the Government, the Government will proceed with the establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau but will defer consideration of other aspects of the legislation as introduced some weeks ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0)

* So if the 1 964 General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd strike had been a lock-out instead of a strike- iri other words, if General Motors had locked out the number of workers who were involved in that dispute for the number of days that that dispute lasted- the total penalty imposed upon General Motors under the existing Act, to which the <span class="highlight">unions</span> say they have no objection, would have been a total fine of about $9,000.

* Again, Bob Hawke, with the calling of the meeting today of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> affiliated with theAustralian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> and the shop stewards, has been the vehicle by which there will be another inquiry into a work value case in regard to the Latrobe Valley.

* Last May when similar legislation- not exactly the same, but similar legislation- was put before this Parliament the resolution of the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span> executive was that if it were passed into law there would be massive economic dislocation in this country.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* What has happened is that there has been consultation in the sense that the <span class="highlight">unions</span> have been shown what the Government intends to do; some minor changes have been made to the Government's proposals; then the legislation has been put before the House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* It in fact will be an industrial police force, which will be there to impose a whole array of pains and penalties upon the <span class="highlight">unions</span> if that legislation is enacted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* From that industrial action so widely defined- just doing work in a way different from the way in which it is normally performed or a work to rule or anything like that- flow a lot of very important implications for <span class="highlight">unions</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* The only way in which it can work is if the <span class="highlight">unions</span> are so frightened of deregistration that they would give in on the expectation that they would be deregistered if they undertook certain action. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* If the Government thinks the Federal Court of Australia will be allowed to take over the trade union movement, suspend its officials, direct its funds, direct the operations of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> and the union movement will quietly accept that, the Government has another think coming. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* The second principle is that <span class="highlight">unions</span> in Australia I am talking now specifically about <span class="highlight">unions</span> and not employer organisations- are in a very privileged position. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* Hence, if advantages of these sorts are to be given to <span class="highlight">unions</span> which apply for preference or which obtain this exclusive right of representation, that system must operate in such a way that those who are not members of the organisation are not prejudiced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* They do not want people to be joining <span class="highlight">unions</span> because the union provides a benefit, because the union is so good that it attracts people voluntarily to join it; they want people to be obliged to join compulsorily.

* Because <span class="highlight">unions</span> are in a privileged position once they are registered, because of preference and because of the right of exclusive representation, this system must be given balance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* It must be a system which gives rights also to those who do not want to join <span class="highlight">unions</span> and who object to joining <span class="highlight">unions</span> on the grounds of conscientious objection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* Not only should there be some preservation of the rights of people who do not want to join <span class="highlight">unions</span> but likewise there must be a recognition that people who are members of the organisation have rights. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27)

* The third principle is this: If <span class="highlight">unions</span>- again I am talking solely about <span class="highlight">unions</span> on this occasion- do not act responsibly, if they do not use the machinery which is available to them under the Act, they must face the reality of deregistration.

* It is now clear, as it was to me several months ago, that the Australian Council of Trade <span class="highlight">Unions</span>, the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the special conference of the federal <span class="highlight">unions</span> were led up the garden path when they were conned into saying that they would accept existing penalties and processes of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act m return for the abandonment of the more obnoxious provisions of the original Bill.

* As I have pointed out, it may be true that all significant <span class="highlight">unions</span> in one State or another have been involved, but certainly within individual States there is a great deal of suspicion on the part of significant <span class="highlight">unions</span> about the groups that they believe are in charge of the Authority in their State.

* In short, it was a call to the trade unionists of Australia to participate, on their own volition, in a scheme designed to increase their level of competence in organising the activities of their <span class="highlight">unions</span> in a manner conducive to the improvement of working conditions and the more efficient working of industrial relations in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0)

* In combating this mistaken notion of the type of union training propagated by TUTA it is necessary to remind such critics that it is insulting to treat <span class="highlight">unions</span> and unionists as if they were appendages of the employers and the Government and must be supervised at every step.

* Honourable members opposite may like to know that according to the TUTA annual report for 1975-76, the first year of its operations, representatives of <span class="highlight">unions</span> such as the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Sheet Metal Workers Union, the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australia, the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Miners' Federation, the Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia attended TUTA courses throughout Australia.

* The willing participation of these and other <span class="highlight">unions</span> will not be as much in evidence, I fear, in future years now that the Government is proceeding to attack the autonomy of the movement by deliberately weakening the power of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> to control their own training programs through TUTA.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0)

* There is a need to amalgamate smaller craft <span class="highlight">unions</span> and multiple industry <span class="highlight">unions</span> into single industry organisations and a need to make all union officials completely responsible to their own rank and file, both by election and during their term of office.

* One of the matters that was of great concern to a number of the <span class="highlight">unions</span> covering the employees at Whyalla was that if a person suffered some injury while an employee of the shipyard, such as a damaged kneecap or some loss of hearing or anything that left that person with a physical handicap, when that person applied for a job at the steelworks, after having been put off from the shipyards, that person was denied a job because of that injury.

* 2) 1978 is the same sort of anti-union legislation as the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill of last year which set up the useless and inflammatory Industrial Relations Bureau and which also provided for the deregistration of trade <span class="highlight">unions</span>, the fining of trade unionists and the freezing of their lawful funds and property.

* In December 1976 the present Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  attempted to introduce legislation that would have fined trade <span class="highlight">unions</span> $250,000 for hindering or preventing the supply of goods or services by the employer to a corporation if the hindering or preventing of supply would have a substantially adverse effect on the business of the corporation.

* The reason South Australia was able to do that was because of the productivity agreement with the <span class="highlight">unions</span> in which the <span class="highlight">unions</span> promised there would be a reduction in work bans or an improvement in working methods which would enable productivity to be improved and there would therefore be no increase in labour costs per hour of work.
