* This is the summation of what I have said tonight: That the family enterprise has been demonstrated to be both efficient and effective and is the backbone of the rural development of the nation; that the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is a product of policies or the absence of policies; that imposts, such as estate duty, must be totally reconstructed; that this small measure should be only a prelude to this being done as a matter of urgency; and that the vote on the amendment that has been put forward should be a vote of conscience.

* What I was saying was that in view of the fact that there has already been a softening of the Government's attitude in relation to the payments that are to be made for the 1969-70 season - and whether it is to be 20% or 40% I am not clear and I ask the Minister in all sincerity to clarify that point - would it not be reasonable, in view of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside, to use the credit which the Treasurer has made available to him to pay the $1.10 on the 1969-70 pool and start off afresh?

* For the Minister for primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  to describe the present proposal of restricted deliveries to (he Australian Wheat Board as 'positive remedial action', and this reaction as 'courageous and responsible' is an assessment of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which must surely go down in the varied and changing history of this industry as the greatest piece of selfdeception ever perpetrated.

* To increase the base price of wheat by the equivalent of US19c per bushel in the light of the then global stock position and crop prospects was an act of irresponsibility equalled only by the refusal of the governments, Federal and State, to come to grips with the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> now facing the industry.
