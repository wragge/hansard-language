* When one sees that expenditure on social services from the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund for 1972-73, other than that which is included in this legislation, is estimated to reach $l,327m, an increase of $119m over last year, combined with these proposals which will cost $179m in a full year, it can be seen that the Government is certainly taking a very big portion from the total Budget to devote to this highly necessary and desirable area of national need. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0)

* I  have mentioned those things because I feel, looking at the suggestion by the Opposition that there is  a  need for a comprehensive system of national social security, that we do have a system of social advancement and social security in this country which has achieved a tremendous amount for those who have a legitimate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> claim upon the society of which they are a part.

* I am not sure that 'industry' is the most suitable word to use about a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme, but we must remember that involved in a total social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme are doctors, teachers, nurses and social workers all of whom are dedicated to their own particular vocations and to the extra services which they render to mankind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0)

* Some <span class="highlight">welfare</span> establishments such as the wide range of homes and hospitals which are referred to either directly or by inference in the Bill which is now before the Senate, are in themselves large scale industries in which a wide range and a large number of people have a particular and direct interest.

* While recognising the great skills and competence which they possess we must remember that if their work is to provide the maximum benefit to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme it must be undergirded by the involvement of the community at large - because, as I said earlier, this social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme is one in which one section of a community is dependent upon another.

* It is easy for us to pass a Bill and to make congratulatory references this afternoon about the extra sums of money which are involved, and which the Parliament has directed should be involved, and which the taxpayers provide; but at  th-  same time we should remember that any constructive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme must be undergirded by the interested, involved and dedicated service of the people at large.

* These organisations, as honourable senators will no doubt agree, play an important role in looking after the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged or invalid people in their own homes, not only by ensuring that they obtain adequate meals for a nominal charge, but also by providing a necessary contact between people who may be frail and lonely on the one hand and supportive services, such as home nursing, paramedical, housekeeping, emergency transport, shopping, gardening, hairdressing, chiropody, library and general counselling, on the other band.

* The Government seeks to put to one side important Bills relating to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, thus keeping a whole host of people waiting for increased pension benefits and advantages.

* The Australian Government is budgeting for a slightly smaller deficit than last year, but is placing increased emphasis on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures, which should further stimulate personal spending. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53)

* The Government is always in the position where if it carries out any expansion of its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aims it is often said to be extravagant and to be creating a counterforce to pension rises. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53)

* There is much which can be argued about in this legislation, but it is very clear that the Labour Government has quickly implemented its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> reforms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53)

* As  Senator Keeffe  said, as soon as we got into office our first piece of legislation dealt with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> pensions and repatriation payments which were made retrospective to the date of the election. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53)

* I also congratulate those who have been responsible for delaying the publication of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* The reason I have those reservations is that the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> which investigated all aspects of repatriation received much public evidence on the subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* Again I say that I think it is a great pity that the efforts of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> should be picked about by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per capita grants additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are taxation and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems which deal with individuals and families and not with schools.

* But what honourable senators opposite are posing to me is that the Government, in this day and age when it is spending huge amounts on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and on improvements to Service standards- to which  Senator McManus  gave some supportwhen it is trying to catch up on the lack of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in the Services and in the community generally, and when it is providing additional educational facilities, should increase the defence expenditure above the amount which was granted by past governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* But as everybody knows, we have come down on the side of meeting our general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commitments and our commitments to improve Sendee conditions at a time when we can afford to do it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I deal with the Bills particularly against the background of an era in which there is an emphasis by the present Government on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, on decentralisation and on the quality of life.

* The Government is very concerned about the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people, and rightly so. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* One of the things which helps the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program of any nation is the ability of various organisations and sections of our community to communicate not only with their supporters, members, friends or other organisations but, more particularly, with the community at large. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I ask the Government to adhere to the pledge it has given and to explain to the Senate why it has felt it necessary to place these additional charges upon sections of the community which can ill afford to carry them and upon groups which are endeavouring to serve the Australian community not only in terms of education and community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> but also in terms of the important matters of growth and national development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Nevertheless, as the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  has mentioned in the other place, the present government is not altogether satisfied with certain features of the scheme and has asked the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to carry out a critical appraisal, to see if it can suggest better ways of providing a program of accommodation for the aged. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-72-0)

* In the context of the Government's comprehensive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals this Bill represents only a small holding measure, designed to maintain the value, in terms of purchasing power, of the assistance being given to aged persons' hostels. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-72-0)

* During the previous session of this Parliament, this Government introduced 3 major social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Bills. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-73-0)

* The Bill before you today is one of a series of further measures which the Government will be introducing during this session of Parliament to assist the provision of a comprehensive program of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-73-0)

* This is another Bill in the series being introduced in this session to improve <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for elderly people, the purpose of which is to increase the assistance payable to the States under the States Grants (Home Care) Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* In broad terms it provides 3 forms of assistance: Firstly for home care service schemes which provide housekeeping the other domestic assistance for aged people in their own homes; secondly, for the building of senior citizens 'centres; and thirdly, for the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers employed by, or in association with, senior citizens' centres. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* This is in accordance with one of the recommendations made in the first annual report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which was tabled in the Parliament recently. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* The third provision of the Bill concerns assistance towards the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* Section 10 of the principal Act provides that where a person is employed as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer of a senior citizens' centre wholly or mainly in connection with the provision of approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services by or in association with the centre, the Australian Government may pay an amount equal to one-half of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer's salary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* In order to further encourage and assist the provision of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to which I have previously referred, the Amending Bill increases the Australian Government's subsidy from one-half to two-thirds of the salary paid to appropriate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* This Government views the proposals in this Bill as a bridging step between the present unsatisfactory system of fragmented <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes and the Australian Assistance Plan as shown in a discussion paper recently tabled in the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* Indeed, this present measure is a generously improved program to what has gone before but still only a stopgap measure pending the development of more comprehensive, integrated, and adequately planned measures to ensure that the aged and indeed every other section in the community have easy access to a comprehensive range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* I repeat, this is the purpose of the Australian Assistance Plan which is undeniably the most significant step taken in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the history of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0)

* I am saying that this year we will be spending $170m through the Department on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* We placed very high- this was almost our paramount objective- in our order of priorities the belief that we should conduct ourselves responsibly, with balance and common sense and at all times having regard to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia and its people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#debate-0)

* Is their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> not the direct responsibility of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0)

* The Minister or the Department would appear to have the power to pay money out of the Fund to an enterprise which would further Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and employment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-35-0)

* This is just one more instance of the Government's determination to squeeze every dollar it can from primary producers so that its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies can be implemented. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0)

* We are just as sympathetic about his <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and his expanding standard of living and for him to be able to do his job on the land with confidence, high morale and dignity as is any member of the Opposition. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0)

* Our citizens will demand that information services will be their right in the same way that today they look upon matters relating to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and environmental protection as their right. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0)

* It is difficult to evaluate all the consequences and benefits which might result from an upheaval such as this but the impact of these things will be felt strongly not only in the fields of education, culture, health, medicine and science in general but also, more importantly, the impact will be overwhelming in relation to organisation and management of the total society, particularly in our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and our quality of life. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0)

* As the Government has announced that, due to an acute land shortage, it intends to acquire the land in question for development and housing in particular, there are certain people who are prepared to put personal gain before the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and needs of the citizens of the Northern Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0)

* Honourable senators would be aware, of course, that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has already given an undertaking that the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> on the mentally and physically handicapped relating to sheltered workshops and other matters, insofar as they are an Australian Government responsibility, will be implemented by this Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0)

* The Council will have a major responsibility for the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the handicapped and, because of the importance with which this is regarded, it will be reporting direct to the Prime Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0)

* This is the second of 2 Bills the purpose of which is to enable local governing bodies to make a greater contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-46-0)

* On 3 April 1973 the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  announced that Cabinet had that day approved the establishment of a commission on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to make recommendations to the Government on the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* The need for setting up the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is based on the new emphasis we have given to the recognition of adequate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems as being a public right which contributes to the well-being of the total Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* This new philosophy demands a change of emphasis in government policy and in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* Because of the new dignity which such a philosophy gives to the recipients of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, it is the role of the Commission to evolve strategies which will enable those people in the problem situation to take part in the planning of immediate objectives and long term goals. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* Moreover it is the role of the Commission to monitor existing programs, institute research projects, conduct public consultations, and to ensure that those who use the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services are involved in the evaluation of the relevance of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs to their needs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* In developing new goals, implementing long term planning and setting priorities in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, the Commission is charged with the task of taking an overall view of social policy, which encompasses such areas as education, housing, health services, employment policies and other matters, as well as the more  specific issues of income-security payments and personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* The concept and role of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is a most exciting one. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* In future there will be a rational development of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* When the Australian Assistance Plan is fully operationalthe Commission is drafting the plan and will test pilot programs and evaluate the need for alternative and supplemental measures- the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of Australia will be released from the heavy hand of centralism which defined programs in the past. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* I would assert quite firmly that the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in this country to date has been blighted by the way in which past governments as a matter of centralised decision-making determined priorities- and not many priorities at that either- and then by implication indicated to the community that if areas were either unsuitable or had no need for these particular programs then that was tough luck; they missed out altogether. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* Accordingly the response to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of these regions has been inadequate and often irrelevant. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* 1 should also mention that when the Australian Assistance Plan- now being developed by the Government- is fully operational, community based voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services will be fostered and stimulated with generous support so that the service provided and the organisations providing them are related to, and are identified with the community in which they operate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* The only display of centralism in this exercise is the display of responsible decision making by the Australian Government, which has established the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and which in turn directed the Commission to develop the Australian Assistance Plan according to guidelines set down by the Government in order that the administration and operation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and key decision making affecting their direction are very much a local community concern.

* The aim of the Australian Assistance Plan is to assist in the development at a regional level, within a nationally coordinated framework, of integrated patterns of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, complementary to income support programs and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> related aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies.

* I hope that although <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers will be used to ascertain the needs and desires of children, not too much emphasis will be placed on what have become known as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, with all that the term implies, but that a lot of emphasis will be placed on a great deal of informal, friendly, helpful discussion to find out what truly is needed for children.

* The reason that that situation is different from the question of breaking or dissolving a marriage, that the latter is so much more emotional, is because there is the matter of justice in the area of property, joint property which has been earned through joint effort which must be justly and reasonably settled and because, crucially, it is highly likely that the marriage will include a giving birth to children and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the children of the marriage must be paramount.

* I was reading from a discussion paper prepared by the Interim Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which is supposed to perform the function of giving at least some sorts of guidelines to those people who are concerned about the establishment of regional authorities.

 Senator Baume said that when the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act was passed in 1973 the attitude then adopted by the Opposition was to welcome the initiative and to support the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* My recollection is that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act provided for recommendations to be made by the Commission to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* What we have is an Australian Assistance Plan which seems to have crept upon us as a mixture of experimentation, of dispensing of public funds on an increasing scale and of desirable objectives all under the umbrella and justification of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* It is a plan, to use  Senator Baume  's words, under which there can be community involvement in the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* It is good in itself but it depends for its effectiveness on how the community is involved and how <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is advanced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* We do not know what is meant by the term social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and whether any limitation is placed upon the way in which the moneys granted to these interim bodies, may be spent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* We do not know what is a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> project and what is not a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* Why have the local municipal councils not been used as the means by which money for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision in a region is dispensed? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* It seems to me that it would be the appropriate way in which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services could be provided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* They have shown, I think right around the country, a developing concern with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs within municipal boundaries in recent years, but apparently the councils and the council structure are completely bypassed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I think it would be a bad day for Australia if we have millions of dollars available for Ministers or others to dispense as they think fit in order to promote what is broadly called a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objective but in a real sense is securing the interests of the persons who dispense the money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I would like just for a few brief moments to speak on the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects of Senate Estimates Committee E of which I was the  Chairman  and to make observations on a couple of points which I think are of consequence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* When we were discussing the adequacy and availability of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> advisers or workers, or whatever we like to call them, it became readily apparent- I think it was apparent to us all before we got to that stage- that in this country now there is a very grave shortage of trained social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> advisers, planners and workers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I suppose that from day to day in our electorates we must find evidence of situations in which, due to the complexities of life and living these days and to the involvement of people in all sorts of matters, members of the community frequently run into difficulties of one kind or another in which the availability of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> advisers would be of very great assistance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I believe that there is a need for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers because in so many areas in the community people who have some type of entitlement miss out on that entitlement because they do not know that it is available to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I content myself with that brief observation and hope that having raised that matter on this occasion we may see an acceleration of efforts to train for and promote an interest in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work in the Australian community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I do support the concept of the assistance and encouragement of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community development throughout this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* Yet we are going to completely by-pass them in a new form of social and community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* It is the requirement of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, that the regional councils should have representation upon them from State and local governments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* The fact is that there are responsibilities which local government has which are other than those of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes of the type envisaged by the Australian Assistance Plan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* That is what we expect to happen because we believe that this is not only a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program; it is an educative program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* It is a program designed to bring the mass of the Australian people into the distribution of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provided amongst themselves out of their taxation and out of their efforts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* But at the same time the approach which the Government and the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission have taken is that it would be quite wrong to lay down ab initio that these are the rules, that this is the Act, that this is precisely the way the scheme is going to operate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* The Western Regional Council in the 1973-74 period received the sum of $20,000 and it received a capitation grant of $236,004 for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> departments, State and Federal, then have to take over the main burden of assistance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I believe that it will be a contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people in difficult times. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* For this reason it would seem to me, and I think certainly it is the Government's view, that it is desirable that as many organisations of all kinds as possible should become involved in the operation of this plan, even though when one looks at the narrow objectives that the organisation has they may appear to bear very little relation to the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* There are certain <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies which play a very major role in delivering services, particularly in the city of Sydney where I come from, which are going to find it difficult to operate under a regionally funded system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* So while they applaud local initiative and the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, they see themselves as threatened. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* Some of these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services are notable for the fact that they are very flexible and are involved where services are needed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I am not asking on that ground that the regional system be abandoned, but I am asking that account be taken of the fact that there are certain groups giving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> help for whom this kind of arrangement will be inappropriate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I am not convinced that we could not achieve the same aims with regard to the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services if we worked through our local elected councils. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* Finally, I remind  Senator Wheeldon  that I am keen to know the position of the large <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* They should give added impetus to initiatives within their regions to provide a wider range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and to test innovative programs for service delivery. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* If only they knew what the trade union movement had done in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field they would not be so keen to speak in such a fashion as they do about the trade union movement.

* I said earlier that the function of these interim committees was to establish some sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* We have not been told what the definition of '<span class="highlight">welfare</span>' is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> may be best asserted by having a Labor Party member in the district and that may be the way in which the money is meant to be expended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* It is to have all sorts of other people representing bodies within the region- municipal bodies, associations and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* But if the executive committee does not regard that organisation as being an organisation really concerned in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects it can exclude it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* There are a lot of people who see in it a future which could revolutionise the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this country, members of the Opposition are amongst those people, but we do not believe that the program as at present devised ought to be subject to the manipulation to which it is subject at the present time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* Let us ensure that proper <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purposes are served, but let us make sure that there is a proper procedure under which the members of these committees are appointed and under which the money which is able to be dispensed is dispensed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* I describe the Minister as being completely careless in relation to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* His  own actions and the statements that he has made, such as they are, have indicated his complete indifference and carelessness concerning the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants, and I protest strongly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39)

* This authority will enable the Treasurer to continue payments to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in the period from 1 July 1975 until an appropriation measure for 1975-76 is passed by the Parliament.

* At the same time, however, the Prime Minister stated that we stood ready to consult with the States on the provision of additional advances this financial year in the light of developments in the housing industry, the availability of resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to productive use. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0)

* Honourable senators will be aware that the Minister for Housing and Construction has since had discussions with the States about progress on their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs in the current year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0)

* At a conference in Canberra on 1 1 October, he announced to State Ministers that the Australian Government would provide an additional $75m to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1974-75. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0)

* These additional funds will enable the States to take advantage of the present situation in the housing industry to increase their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing activity in a substantial degree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0)

* Overall I suggest there is a need for some body which is co-operative, which has representatives of the profession, of the Government, of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups and of people who are involved in this area to ensure that these things are done on a regular basis and that the gaps are filled. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37)

* I can only assume that his reducing funds is based on a desire to retard the improvements and developments in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this State which so significantly highlight the failures in the Northern Territory and other areas under direct Federal influences and policies which have been admitted as disasters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* Now let me mention <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and refer to the amounts of money to be allocated to the States by the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* In New South Wales some $270,000 is being allocated for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* I am hoping that the Minister will clarify this when he replies and that he will give us some reason why the State of Queensland is not getting at least the same amount, as if not more than, is being allocated for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the other States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* Again Queensland seems to be missing out on the kind of finance that is required for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* I thought we were dealing with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aborigines in Queensland rather than the Queensland Government which  Senator Rae  is supporting in his amendment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* It is an attempt to use this particular Bill, which is for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginals, politically. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* I will not vote for an amendment which will make Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> suffer because some politician wants to gain some votes from it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

* I hope that if he tells people why I do not support his amendment, he will tell them that the first reason is that I do not trust him and the second reason is that  1  do not want the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Queensland Aboriginals to be made a political football as  Senator Bonner  himself has said it ought not to be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0)

* As the argument develops it will be seen that the honourable senator would be critical of anything to the detriment of the vested interests of Ansett, regardless of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of the north of Western Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0)

* When there are children in the family, their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in all its aspects becomes the prime consideration in any decision regarding the marriage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* It is the responsibility of civil authorities to provide an ordered procedure for the dissolution in law of a broken marriage and to ensure that such a dissolution will be effected only after all possibility of reconciliation has been exhausted and after satisfactory arrangements have been made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of any children in the family.

* In a day when we are entering strongly into discussions upon economics, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, foreign affairs and things of this kind, time spent on discussion of marriage, divorce and family <span class="highlight">welfare</span> may seem a little out of context for this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* From my discussions with him, I believe that  Senator Murphy  would wish to add 3 other criteria- The future of the children of a broken marriage needs consideration by the best possible tribunal assisted by the skills of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and other counselling staff wherever needed; the financial disputes between the spouses should be resolved as quickly and finally as possible; the whole process should be performed with dignity, relative privacy and with as little expense as possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* This Bill is about family conflicts- not divorce; it therefore deals with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children, maintenance, property, protection of the marriage and the people involved therein (by injunction if necessary), marriage counselling, on going help in custody and access problems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0)

* Let us face the obvious fact that conciliation and arbitration in the Australian scene over many years have been successful in bringing about a degree of industrial peace, a degree of production and a degree of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and development which have been the envy of most, if not all, countries around the world.

* But once again, as with export incentives or export subsidies, if any, surely it is more rational to be selective about the areas in which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments will be made and it is necessary to be more selective than just to make them available on an across-the-board basis so that they would be available to people who perhaps do not even have a liquidity problem, or certainly do not have an asset problem.

* The Minister stated that the Labor Government had been forced to curtail expansion of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in this country because expansion in this area had been too extravagant- At the time the Hayden Budget was being prepared the pressure was on for cutbacks in public spending but the State governments, particularly the Queensland Government and the New South Wales Government, ignoring the philosophical expressions coming from the new Leader of the Liberal Party,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, set out in anticipation of an expanded housing program for 1 975- 1 976.

* Looking at this Budget in the broad and reducing it to the essential simplicity of the position, one will see that the Government set out to reduce Government waste and extravagance which had been a product of the Labor years; to stop money being thrown down the drain; to make money available to reduce personal income tax, as the honourable senator has said; to help in social security and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and to lead to economic recovery. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Commission was established in 1973 because it was felt that a need existed for an independent body to evaluate the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems of this country, to advise the government of the day on the effectiveness and efficiency of its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies, to conduct and commission research and data gathering, and to recommend how new initiatives could be introduced and how the current system of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> could be better co-ordinated to suit the needs and priorities of this nation- the needs and priorities largely of alleviating and preventing poverty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The Commission, I believe, carried out in its short lifetime an imaginative program of investigation and research, and improved greatly the information available on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* One would hope that the work of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the work of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and other inquiries into various aspects of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will enable us and inspire us to take a more thoughtful and rational approach to the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* It was an attempt by a government to establish an organisation which could sit back and look at the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field with a broad view, to make dispassionate analyses of the problems and suggest alternatives to the present system and within the present system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The processes of government in this country meant that any independence given to the Commission was at best curtailed by the influences of the Public Service- influences such as that of the Public Service Board on staffing, perhaps of the Treasury on finance and of other established departments in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field in general. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The lack of staff which the Commission suffered and the inability to overcome the deplorable lack of hard statistical information were inhibiting factors in an organisation which attempted- and which I believe attempted gallantly- to have a meaningful look at the overall <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Another problem that I believe the Commission had is that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field in general and the social security field in general does not only involve the Department of Social Security but also involves departments dealing with education, housing, the environment, urban and regional development and in particular the Attorney-General's Department in respect of legal aid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I believe, as  Dr Coombs  has pointed out, that these departments in their own way are very jealous of their own responsibilities, their own areas of activity and their own power and view an intrusion like that of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission as an unwelcome one to say the least. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The experience of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is a reminder to us all of the importance placed on power of various sorts in our systemthe importance of power to the bureaucracy as well as the importance of power to the political arm of government at any level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The reaction of some members of the bureaucracy to both the announcement by the previous Government and the announcement by this Government of the abandonment of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was at times one of indecent haste to be in at the kill, to be in at the dismemberment of the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* A perusal of any of the papers, the productions or the research projects of the commission in its short life reveals much which will long be useful to all of us who are interested in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and will be a useful reference, I believe, to all people concerned in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* One understands that the committees will consist of a variety of people involved in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, including departmental members, members of voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations and, one would hope, consumers in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Personally, I do not share the belief of the Minister expressed in her second reading speech that consolidating advice on research on and into social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters within the Department is necessarily a good thing unless there is careful outside assessment of the advice, the effects of this advice and evaluation of the ultimate outcome of the various plans introduced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I am not opposing this legislation but as I said earlier in my speech, it is with some regret that I see the ending of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and what I have regarded as a very useful contribution to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> research and co-ordination in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I repeat what I said at the commencement of my speech: I think the downfall- I specifically do not use the word 'failure'- of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission reflects as much the failures of all of us in the processes of Government in this country as it reflects anything that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission did or was involved in. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I am reminded that he was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and that the consideration by that Committee of the clauses of the National Compensation Bill last year probably saw the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission functioning at its finest hour because it was the evidence and contribution of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which more than anything else demonstrated the shortcomings in the proposed legislation and which led to its being withdrawn.

* Looking at what the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was able to achieve in less than 2 1/2 years, it had an impressive record of achievement and especially tonight when we are debating the motion that the establishment Bill should be repealed, it is worth listing some of the achievements of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I simply interpolate in this debate on the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission that I believe in the Australian Assistance Plan and hope from the announcement the Minister has made that it can continue.

* Looking further at the achievements of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission there was the establishment of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> research grants and these have led to the commissioning of a large number of papers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* To a large extent the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission developed a coherent social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program and this program did not run entirely parallel to the grandiose designs of  Mr Whitlam  because the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission put its emphasis more upon the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the most needy whereas  Mr Whitlam  's program often had more of a universalist bias. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The major article in the  Financial Review  of 6 June 1975 described the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission as 'a major critic' of the Government's policies, especially as they related to the proposals of the Whitlam Government to develop a quite impractical national compensation scheme. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  has made it clear that he believes it more appropriate for bodies doing such jobs as that done by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to be directly answerable to the Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I hope that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Research Group which will operate within the University of New South Wales and report to the Minister for Social Security will be as effective as the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission has been in offering critical advice on such a wide ranging group of issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I simply draw to the attention of honourable senators that there is an increasing concern about evaluations of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in Australia and a reference was given by the Senate to one of the standing committees for evaluation of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* The Senate is debating a Bill for the repeal of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act 1973, yet the speakers in this debate so far have almost entirely spoken in support of that body which is being repealed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* He was so enthusiastic in his support of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>  Commission,  particularly the way in which he saw it as a formidable critic of the Whitlam Government and its proposals, that I thought for a moment he was going to oppose the legislation before us tonight and vote for the retention of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission for that reason if for that alone. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I will not be opposing the repeal of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Like my colleague,  Senator Grimes,  who has already spoken in this debate, I accept the necessity at this stage for the repeal of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I rise to speak also because I think there are some questions to be raised about the future performance of the functions which have been carried out by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to date. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* When the Commission was established it was given a number of functions, the major one being to make recommendations to the Minister for furthering the achievement of a nationally integrated social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Its functions included the requirement, set out in section 14 of the Act, that it should make recommendations for avoiding duplication of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and for promoting the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the community social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> effort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* It seems to me at this stage of the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in this country that neither of those objectives has been achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Certainly we do not have anything at this stage that could be called a nationally integrated social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plan and we still have a multitude of duplication and fragmentation of services, as any person who has fallen into the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> network and tried to avail himself of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits will tell you only too readily. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* So at this stage there is still a need for a body to perform the functions which the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was set up to perform. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Because of this high rate of unemployment and the associated disruption to many individuals and groups in society there is a greater call on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs than previously and, I think, a greater opportunity to focus on the inadequacy of many of our programs, and in particular the lack of co-ordination between them.

* I think that at this period when we have many Australians dependent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits we might start to consider very seriously the necessity for something like a guaranteed minimum income scheme for all individuals and families in our society.

* It is to just that sort of new way of measuring economic need that a body like the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission could have devoted itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I quoted that particular example because I think it demonstrates that there is a real problem in terms of the provision as well as the administration of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and in ensuring that field officers carry out the Government's policies and do not project their own attitudes into their work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* We on this side of the chamber had hoped that the Government would formulate a better plan for the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> having regard to the enthusiasm for the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the Australian Assistance Plan which has been so often expressed by Government supporters.

 Senator Baume spoke tonight with such enthusiasm about the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission that I wondered why he was not opposing its repeal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Despite those commitments to a nationally developed social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> body- independent, objective, able to operate outside the framework of the bureaucracy- the provisions made to date by the Government following the abolition of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission fall far short of those objectives. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I have read with care the Minister's second reading speech and, although most of the functions of the former Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission will continue in some form or another, the more valuable and innovatory aspects of the Commission's work will be lost in the new arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Although the Minister has announced that a new unit will be set up within the University of New South Wales for research and data collection, at this stage I doubt whether such a unit in a university will be able to repeat the kind of research work that has been carried out by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Senator Baume  gave the Senate a long list of the research activities of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, and I doubt that the unit being set up for the purpose will be able to continue that breadth of research. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* It is my understanding that there will be no new developments in our universities as a result of the last Budget, and I wonder if the unit will have sufficient funds to perform the sorts of functions in the research and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas which the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was performing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* We have been told by the Minister that research projects not completed by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission will be completed, but we have been given no indication of future field work that may be carried out by the Department of Social Security, which has taken over the work of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission.

* Overall, the new arrangements for the continuation of the work of the Commission suggest fragmentation and a breaking down of the excellent teamwork which had been developed by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I think that fragmentation must lead inevitably to poorer quality advice, to less innovation, and to a diminishing of progress towards the original objective of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, that is, the formulation of an integrated national social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* I had intended to speak of the excellent work published so far by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, but as  Senator Baume  has already given such a comprehensive list, which no doubt he had memorised in order not to have to read it in the chamber, I will not repeat it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Suffice it to say that I agree that in its 3 years of operation the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission did an enormous amount of work in preparing reports on a very wide range of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> issues.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* In conclusion, I should like to repeat that I doubt whether the arrangements made by the Government for the carrying on of the functions performed by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission will be adequate for what we all seem to agree is necessary, that is, a nationally integrated social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plan. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Senator Grimes  referred to the anticipation of the abolition of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, and I believe that some statement should be made in response to that. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* It should be understood that in June of last year the then Government announced its intention to repeal the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act and to abolish the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* Any action that was taken to transfer the functions of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to the Department of Social Security perhaps could be interpreted as pre-empting a decision of this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* It may be of interest to honourable senators to know that on 20 February there were 49 officers in the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and that as at 19 August the staff situation was as follows: Twenty-five officers had been transferred within the Australian Public Service; 4 officers had resigned from the Australian Public Service; and 20 officers were still within the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission.

* In relation to the co-ordination and evaluation functions of the Commission, it was not kept informed of policy program initiatives with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications prior to government decisions; it was never given the power to enforce co-ordination nor was it given an automatic right  of  access to Cabinet submissions on policy proposals affecting social policy, thus placing the Commission's independent review role at serious risk.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0)

* With regard to the co-ordination of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the formulation of a national plan on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, I draw attention to the operation at the present time of the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> task force, which is looking closely at matters of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and which soon will be reporting to the Government on ways in which there can be co-ordination between those and other departments with related responsibilities.

* A bugbear in all systems of providing accommodation for the aged, in fact a bugbear in the whole of our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system, is that of deciding the criteria for need, in this case for financial, social and medical need.

* As the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission stated in its report entitled  Care for the Aged,  it is inevitable that the financial responsibility for the capital construction, upkeep and staffing of these institutions in most cases will rest with the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0)

* We have to accept that, and the kinds of programs that have evolved from government in the last 15 or 20 years have increasingly recognised that it is a proper role of government to provide support for aged persons' <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing.

* A series of programs has certainly provided housing places for people who need them but we have no evidence of uniform availability of aged persons' <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to all the potential clients. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0)

* It is more difficult,  Mr Acting Deputy President-  and we both come from the same city- for a Mount Druitt community to provide the basic amount of money needed to start a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing project than it is for an established charity or for people somewhere on the North Shore.

* I give notice now that if there is one thing that our Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> will examine it is programs like the aged persons <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing program to determine what goal the scheme thinks it is serving and to what extent these schemes are serving those programs.

* A major consideration in the formulation of the Lynch package for 1976-77 was the Government's concern for those people who are not wage and salary earners but who are dependent upon social services and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs for the alleviation of the distressing effects of misfortune and old age.

* When we were elected we discovered that the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system of this country, which once had been the envy of the whole Western word, had degenerated to such an extent that it was well behind the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems of all of northern and western Europe and that the areas from which previously large numbers of immigrants had come to this country had dried up because working people were not prepared to leave the Netherlands, West Germany, France, Austria, Norway or Sweden to come to this country.

* The reason was that, despite the fact that they lived in countries where in proportion to the population there was much less wealth than there is in Australia, they were still much better off than they would have been if they had come here, because of the total breakdown of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system that had occurred in this country during 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government.

* Honourable members will recall the decision to establish the Task Force on Co-ordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health arose out of the Government's concern at the proliferation, duplication and overlap of Commonwealth programs and services in the health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community development fields.

* It is important that the Opposition, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipient organisations and the various <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations in all States at least now will be able to study both of these reports, discuss their findings, their relevance to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scene in this country, and contribute, we hope, although we sometimes doubt whether we will be able to do so, to the outcome of these reports and the eventual implementation of the recommendations.

* We believe that the guidelines that were given to both these committees were unnecessarily narrow and mainly demonstrate the Government's pre-occupation with finding real or imagined overlaps and duplications in our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and its obvious desire to foist as many of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs as possible on to the States with a resultant reduction in the cost to the Commonwealth.

* It is notable that despite the very strong words in the statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  relating to duplications and overlaps in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the implication in the statement that these largely caused the problems about which we all know in our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, the Bailey Task Force, at page 24 of its report, states: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0)

* It is very important that this obsession with duplication and overlap- as I said, real or imagined- must not overshadow the findings of all the more detailed, careful, independent and, I suggest, useful inquiries which show that the overwhelming problem in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field or the health field in this country is not duplication and overlap but gaps.

* Considering the personnel on those committees- not the individual personnel but their association with the government servicethe time schedule and the tight terms of reference that were given to those committees, I believe that they were just intended to be a means whereby the philosophical goals of the present Government of pushing off as much expenditure and responsibility in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field to the States could be adequately fulfilled.

* Therefore, we in the Opposition urge that the Government not treat these reports as it treated whatever report came out of the Medibank Review Committee and that it provide not only ample consultation with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, with the people who are to receive <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, but also ample consultation with all other members of the community who are interested in this aspect.

* If we allow <span class="highlight">welfare</span> development in this country to continue to grow like Topsy, as it has done for 77 years, and if we go on adding bits and pieces here in response to some articulate group around election time or out of a desire to do something nice in a Budget the contents of which are otherwise unpleasant, the shambles will get worse.

* Merely reorganising the funding of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, shifting them to the States, shifting the responsibilities from one department in the Federal Government to the other and ceasing funding through direct organisations but channelling it through the States is no way to bring decent reform to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this country.

* While I agree that of course the total scheme, the total <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget and the priorities of one group over another must be looked at, a situation can come where there has to be some limit, when something has to be judged to be of a lesser priority and it must go.

* It seems inescapable that the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system has operated without clearly identified policy goals and program objectives, without an adequate system of social indicators, without clearly stated standards of provision or performance, without adequate evaluation technologies, without a pool of people trained to use such technologies as are available, and without resources committed to measurement and to knowing in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0)

* The Opposition believes that any attempt to reduce the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> vote, as is advocated by many Government supporters and people in the community, should be resisted strongly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0)

* I think it could be said that  Senator Grimes  who commenced the debate has canvassed widely the expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and on the other areas of economic responsibility of the Government.

* I agree with  Senator Grimes  that it is important in the pre-Budget context for those people who receive benefit from income security or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs to have a voice in those matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0)

* If we relate what is paid through the Department of Social Security on income security and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, we find that about 85 per cent of all personal income tax collections are spent on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0)

* I think we cannot ever have a discussion on anything relating to the Budget without recognising that, last year, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was a $10 billion figure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0)

* At the same time as looking at <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure I think we need to look at those other programs of government and talk of what has been able to be done in the matter of child care and children's services, services for handicapped people where the three-year program has given a much wider spread and improved service in our rehabilitation services, and in the very many excellent services which are conducted by the community groups, in some cases where we with State governments are jointly sharing projects.

* Whilst there may be speculation from many people in regard to the forthcoming Budget, I simply stress that in each of the Budgets there has been improvement in the income security system and there has been improvement in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0)

* Without impinging on what are necessarily Budget considerations and decisions, I simply say, as I have said before when referring to widows and others, that it is thoughtless and extraordinary that at this time each year speculation about every social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program causes anxiety to many people.

* Indeed, the record of achievement of the Government in the last three years is such a very good one that it gives a great deal of security and confidence to the people of Australia that the Fraser Government will continue to enact responsible Budget decisions in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services.

 Mr Gee, as I have said, has given conclusive proof that the Labor Party in its wisdom did something concrete to establish this laboratory, despite the fact that honourable senators opposite try to create the impression in the minds of country people, particularly primary producers, that we are not concerned with their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>.

* Why reject the feasibility of making the sort of tax inroads into profitability which would enable governments to carry out their responsibilities, lt is interesting to note that most of the calls that are coming to this Government to cut back on public sector spending and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and to reduce other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments are coming from the very groups of people to which I am referring in the mining companies.

* If we look again at figures- and I do not like using figures too much in a speech because I believe that people can lose track of what is being said- we find that in the Australian Labor Party Budget of 1975-76 a total of $5,000m was spent on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and this represented 23.2 per cent of the Budget.

* There is no mention in this Bill that the Government will provide extra funds to voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations to allow them to carry the extra burden which will be imposed upon them as a result of the Government refusing unemployment benefit to many people who may be put out of work by a strike which is not of their own making. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58)

* I ask the Minister whether it is the Government 's intention to make extra moneys available through some other avenue, not only to the community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments or whatever they are termed in the States, but also to the voluntary organisations so that they can provide the necessary food and clothing or whatever else may be needed for the people who are out of work, and their wives and dependants.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0)

* In more precise terms the Committee's recommendations seek: Development of a continuing set of social indicators and substantial upgrading and refinement of other data on the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian population and the provision of relevant services; development and dissemination of comprehensive standards for health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services; a commitment by all levels of government to identify and declare needs in Australian health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and to assess these factors continually by reference to these data and standards; clear and public declaration by the Commonwealth Government of broad strategic goals and precise and testable objectives in terms of intended impact on needs for each of its health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, whether funded wholly or only in part by it; and continuing evaluation of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0)

* The Committee suggests that, because there is little evaluation of the kind it favours, the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system is 'out of control'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0)
