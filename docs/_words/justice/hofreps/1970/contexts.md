* Nevertheless, after  Sir Garfield  became Chief: <span class="highlight">Justice</span> - and there were people who said at the time that this was a great loss to the cause of banning restrictive practices, because it was thought that the best poachers often proved to be the best gamekeepers - the next AttorneyGeneral, the present ; Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  brought in a trade practices Bill which had no reference to vertical resale price maintenance.

* Surely the work done by the committee of inquiry headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Kerr into the fundamental conditions of service in the forces would have indicated the need for an explanation by the Minister for Defence of his attitude towards a regular volunteer army and even a comment in the White Paper on this aspect of volunteer forces.

 Mr Polites, at that time anyway, was the main voice for the Employers Federation, an organisation whose views carry considerable weight with the Liberal-Country Party Government; an organisation whose members subscribe very largely to Liberal and Country Party funds; an organisation which over the years has done everything within its power to depress workers' wages and prevent improvement in conditions; an organisation which has acted as best it could to deny wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> to workers in one industry, if such wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> could perhaps flow on to workers in another industry.

* What  Mr Polites  was advocating was that if any wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> exists in this country by way of some democratic system it should be replaced by a system of absolute dictatorship, a dictatorship controlled by a Liberal Government in collaboration with the Employers Federation, which could stop any further progress by unions towards obtaining a better deal for their members and, in turn, obtaining a fairer share of profits resulting from greater efforts of workers.

* All this amendment means to me is that it is a direction from the Government to the Commission to cast out claims for wage increases unless it is placed in a position where it cannot possibly do so and, when that occurs, to make any increase as small as possible, in other words, it is asking the Commission to accept the full responsibility for any price increases which may follow wage <span class="highlight">justice</span> when in actual fact that responsibility lies fairly and squarely upon the Government to prevent unscrupulous retailers or manufacturers from charging unwarranted prices.

* If the Minister were prepared to take 3, 4 or 5 weeks off to try to get agreement between the States, to get the necessary commitments from his friends in the Builders Labourers Federation and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, maybe he would get them to take the necessary voluntary action which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney says they would need to take before effect could be given to these provisions.

* The judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullager in the Hursey case some years ago, which is also partly quoted in the Sweeney report, might seem to indicate that clause 8, which seeks to amend section 139, could be of some doubtful constitutional validity.

* I think that, in a sense, this is a fake provision because the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fullager would seem to indicate that no State law could modify a law passed properly by this Parliament and in accordance with this Parliament's constitutional provisions.

* The Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> is on record as having said that it may be granted that a dispute solely between 2 registered organisations of employees, each of which is able by its own constitution to have members who follow the same trade or calling, as to which of them should be entitled to represent and protect the industrial interests of persons following that trade or calling, would not be an industrial dispute within the statutory definition.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* I should think that that would lead to some real problems because on page 43 of the copy of the report I have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney said: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* Here  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney refersthere was no mention of this by the Minister- to the problems of not being able to sue the nonincorporated State branch of a Federal organisation by naming the secretary as the person to be sued. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney says that this position can be met by the State machinery requiring as a condition of registration of a Federal branch that the organisation enter into a deed undertaking to pay to the industrial registrar- I believe that this would be the Federal industrial registrar- any penalty imposed in respect of a strike or lockout under the State Act and remaining unpaid for a period. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words in place thereof: the House is of opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with until the Minister informs the House- (a) whether or not the Trade Unions would accept the conditions for non-incorporated registration of State branches as laid down by the Honourable  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney and (b) of the position of the States concerning proposed complementary legislation.

* As it happens,  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney came to much the same conclusions as the working party came to, but what is important is that the people who have to make the system work ought to have before them a package of legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* Although  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney is satisfied that his recommendations do not offend the Constitution, we would all feel on safer ground if the 4 States agreed that this was so.

* Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney, in fact, at page 16 of his report recommended the solution adopted by this Bill, but it is surely relevant that this Parliament be sure that the New South Wales Parliament will pass complementary legislation.

* On the same page of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney's report, at paragraph 4, he highlights the need for more than mere complementary legislation by the States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0)

* It was made quite clear to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney in the course of his inquiry that in a number of cases persons who were not employers, for example, persons conducting their own businesses but not having employees, were enrolled as members of employer organisations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* Honourable members will recall that in his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney mentioned that there was an urgent need for persons engaged in business, particularly those who were engaged in small businesses but who were not employers, that is, the business was so small that they did not employ people, to have representation and the benefit of representation in matters such as prices, tariffs, customs duties and various other matters.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* If the Australian Registrar is to have this power which really allows the protection in the funding proposals of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney to be overridden at the discretion of the Registrar, an alternative approach could well be for an appeal to be allowed to the appropriate tribunal concerning the Registrar's decision.

* The procedures of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney for non-incorporated registration would fall down entirely, as the Minister has admitted, if the trade union movement is not prepared to accept this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* We would be better able to know whether this legislation would then have effect or whether the House, the Minister and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney have been wasting their time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* It is ambiguous from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney's statement, whether he was referring to a State registrar or a Federal registrar. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* But I would also suggest in relation to clause 5 of the Bill that while the proposals seem reasonably clear the way  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sweeney has drafted them, and while in reading the clause it might appear that there will therefore be no problems, it is my understanding that the federally incorporated body is the only one that can in fact own property and that there could well be, as opposed to having a fund under the - [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39)

* There is no doubt that there is a necessity to recognise that if we are to appoint people of the calibre of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Else-Mitchell to positions like this to carry out impartial and appropriate inquiries into the needs of local government we have to acknowledge their position in the community and establish them so that they hold the position they previously enjoyed.

* What my distinguished predecessor,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy of the High Court, stated was that he believed the case Australia had put to the Court and the injunction granted by the Court in 1973 had influenced the French Government's decision to discontinue atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific.

* But I have no doubt that the initiative which the Australian Government took in 1973, and the vigorous development of that position before the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, served as a focal point in the mobilisation of international opinion against French atmospheric testing; and that this factor was one which influenced the French Government in the decision which it took.

* Even the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  would agree that at the Bar  His  Honour was an outstanding personality, that he was a brilliant student, an excellent advocate and became a first class judge and, having earned all those qualifications, became entitled to the title or designation  'Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>'.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0)

* The real solution in this matter is not to proceed with this court but to attempt basic constitutional reform of the judicature chapter of the Constitution and in the meantime, I suggest, to use what has been referred to by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  ElseMitchell, for instance, in an article that he had published in the Federal Law Review, as the autochthonous expedient- the use of the State courts as repositories of Federal jurisdiction.

* I sincerely trust that the appointment of an Australian ombudsman and the 2  deputy  ombudsmen and the establishment of an Australian Appeals Tribunal will ensure not only that <span class="highlight">justice</span> is done and is seen to be done but also that what has been described as the delicate path between the rights of individual citizens and harmony in the machinery of government will be clearly and effectively protected.

* I refer to the fact that the other systems of change have so dismally failed that the High Court which interprets the Constitution and which I heard the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> say the other day was actually an arm of government that is something with which I might not necessarily agree- has turned out to be the instrument of change.

* The Prime Minister came in tonight and used the overwhelming majority of his statement to indicate all the background but he made no reference to the discussions that occurred prior to his assumption of office, no reference to the discussions that occurred shortly before he became Prime Minister, but rather sought to justify an exercise which was bent upon mischief, which sought to get around the Queensland view, and which probably will mean an inescapable venture into disputation for years to come- and not disputes in the Australian Territory but in the international sphere, not just through the United Nations but also at the International Court of <span class="highlight">Justice</span>.

* This Bill will establish in our law those aspects of Aboriginal traditional law relating to land which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Blackburn could not uphold in 1971 in the Gove land rights case: It creates for Aboriginals proprietary interests in, and communal title to, land, and makes that title inalienable.

* It is not impossible, in fact it is quite likely, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has already given the Prime Minister a memorandum suggesting these amendments, but it is not unreasonable for us to suggest that the exercise of responsibility conducted by the previous Attorney-General of this Commonwealth, in his actions in raiding ASIO in 1973, and the profound effect which that action had on the Organisation, could well have led the Prime Minister to conclude that he could not trust any other Minister within his ministry to conduct and oversee the vital work which is the responsibility of ASIO.

* The time already taken in investigation of these proposals and particularly in investigation of the proposal of land rights for Aborigines has been  very great, and there can be no question that the inquiry into land rights carried out by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward was one of the most thorough and searching inquiries which has been seen in this country in recent years, yet the Opposition is anxious to see this legislation referred for yet another inquiry.

* Those who cry that a lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been shown to the Victorian dairy farmers- I am a Victorian dairy farmer- because of the market milk levy overlook the fact that the States jealously retain their power over intrastate milk, the Victorian Government no less than the others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* It is hypocritical for a Victorian Minister to claim that lack of <span class="highlight">justice</span> has been shown because the Victorian dairy farmers theoretically cannot take on the Sydney milk market when the same Victorian farmers will be prevented for 10 years by that same Minister from complete access to the Melbourne market and to cry about UHT milk- ultra-high treatment milk- being included in the levy if and only if it is found to be disrupting orderly marketing when Victorian UHT milk has been effectively barred from the Melbourne market for many years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* However, that raises the important question of whether, if the additional financial return for market milk is not to be equalised, then, as a position of minimum <span class="highlight">justice</span> for southern dairy farmers the quantity of that milk should be included in the national entitlement; that is, that the quantity as distinct from its value should be included or, to put it another way, the butterfat equivalent of market milk produced in a State should be included in the State's entitlement and the State should then be left to sort out how it will handle the market milk in the provision of an individual farmer's entitlements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0)

* The Minister should be prepared to go against the majority of the States if they are not prepared to concede the <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the argument that I have just put on the inclusion of the butterfat equivalent of the market milk entitlement in the national aggregate entitlement, just as that same Minister decided against the State with the majority of production when he introduced the market milk levy.

* In his report,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose recommended that repatriation boards should be abolished and replaced by a system whereby the initial determination of claims should be the responsibility of the Commission exercising its powers through suitably qualified persons acting individually as delegates. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0)

* On the other hand,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose recommended that, if repatriation boards were retained, the members when appointed should be subjected to an intensive training programme before making determinations, rotation of board chairmen and members should be actively pursued and the boards should be made clearly and directly subject to active oversight by the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0)

* The object of these provisions is to obtain better co-ordination among boards, to ensure the attainment of a high standard by boards in the discharge of their duties, as suggested by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose, but without reducing the independence of each board in the exercise of its determining power under the Act in respect of individual cases.

* Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose reported that there was before his inquiry a considerable amount of evidence that the present section 47 had caused much dissatisfaction and frustration and he concluded that the present provisions of section 47 have proved most unsatisfactory and should be amended.

* What  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose reported and what those of us who have been interested in repatriation for some time as a result of helping constituents or ex-members have been aware of is that some deserving ex-members do not get benefits and do not have certain conditions accepted while the cases of others whose conditions have been accepted and who possibly get pensions may not be as deserving or as clear cut.

* 
 Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Toose was correct in his findings that many claims in the past have been presented in an inadequate fashion, as the honourable member for Prospect also said, resulting mainly from a misunderstanding of section 47 of the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0)

* Iii some instances this created a feeling of distrust and injustice towards members of a board by some claimants. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0)

* I do not even begrudge the amount if it is going to mean the correction of injustice in respect of the exservicemen of this country or, as we now use the American jargon, the veterans of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0)

* I well remember the then honourable member for Balaclava,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske, and  Dr Evatt  taking a very great interest in this matter and the Returned Services 's League bringing forward to this Parliament the Queen's Counsels' views on the interpretation of section 47 of the Act, which sets out the onus of proof provisions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0)

* -I think that the exservicemen of this country regard  Dr Evatt  and a former Attorney-General,  Senator Spicer,  as well as a former honourable member for Balaclava, now  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Joske, as the great freedom fighters about section 47.

* Dr Evatt,  as he was then, referred in  Hansard  in the 1955 to the judgment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Denning in the case of  Miller  v.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0)

* The reason why the Government did not accept the recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Toose that repatriation boards should be abolished was simply that there was a tremendous weight of criticism made by various ex-service organisations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* When we read what <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox has to say about the Non-Proliferation Treaty we realise that honourable members who are speaking here against the export of Australian uranium ore should have second thoughts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0)

* I find myself thoroughly disturbed because earlier in the statement he enumerated a number of things which the Government has positively in train, yet later he outlined a number of things into which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will inquire. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0)

* For instance, the matters which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will consider will include relationships between State, Territorial and Commonwealth police, and between law enforcement agencies, intelligence and other relevant civilian authorities.

* So the two strands which I have mentioned come together- the fact that he has made this decision, presumably without consulting the States, and the fact that he has gone on to appoint a commission of inquiry headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope with terms of reference which are completely undermined by the firm conviction that he has already arrived at and the course of action upon which he has already set.

* I cannot understand why he then wants to set up an inquiry under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope into matters which he obviously expects to have under way and well advanced long before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope will be able to report.

* On the one hand the Prime Minister is making it quite clear that he has firmly decided upon certain courses of action and, on the other hand, he is proposing that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope should be charged with the responsibility of whitewashing what the Prime Minister has already decided to set in train. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0)

* I suggest that if the Government wants  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope to hold any inquiry then it should set up an inquiry headed by him to find out just what did happen at the Hilton Hotel on Monday morning of last week, how it happened and who was responsible for the obvious failures in the general nature of security at that hotel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is worrying that while the Prime Minister concludes his statement by proposing an inquiry by <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope, he commences the same statement by making it abundantly clear that the key elements of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope's inquiry have in fact already been determined by him.

 Mr E. G. WHITLAM By the same token,  Sir, the  Governor-General was given a pension similar to that of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> so that he could act without fear or favour because he knew that in retirement he would have an ample pension which would not require him to seek other employment.

* The situation in relation to the High Court of Australia, as I think the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition will be pleased to confirm, is that there have been times when, because of the illness of a judge or for some other pressing reason, it has not been possible for the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court to release judges to take their long service leave.

* I say with as much force as I can muster that to suggest in any way, shape or form that the Government's approach to this legislation has been affected by anything  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor has or has not done in recent times is a proposition which I would reject categorically. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0)

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition did not go on to say, as one might have thought that he would, that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor will not get these benefits because of things he put in the report of his royal commission, the people he criticised or the actions that followed the release of that report.

* It has taken the way out which will not not have much appeal to those citizens in Australian society who believe that there has to be a measure of social <span class="highlight">justice</span> in our community, that economic sacrifice ought to begin at the highest levels of our community, and not at the bottom.

* This speech is made in what I believe to be a climate of general acceptance by the community that legal expenses can be so devastating for the individual that in some instances governments must play a role in absorbing some or all of the impact to ensure <span class="highlight">justice</span> is within reach.

* In a royal commission situation-  Mr Deputy Speaker,  this point is relevant because  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  McGregor is one judge who has been mentioned in this debate- or in the case of a government inquiry where legal representation is allowed, to pay more than would normally be allowed by the Supreme Court of a State or the High Court, on a party and party basis, is an unforgivable waste of the taxpayers' money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0)

* It can be argued also that when government agrees to pay outrageous fees without question it is becoming a pace setter in relation to legal fees and hence it is placing <span class="highlight">justice</span> even further beyond the reach of  Mr and Mrs Average.

* Above all, in <span class="highlight">justice</span>, it is positive proof of the proposition that, if we are serious about the employment of Australian workers, it does not behove the purchaser of a particular utensil or piece of machinery to keep those workers in their jobs.

* (a) The decision as to whether an inquest is to be held is not a matter for my Depanment but solely the concern of the State Minister for <span class="highlight">Justice</span> who, after he has received representations by the claimant's solicitors or other advice, has the power to make an application to the Supreme Court for an order that an inquest be held pursuant to section 37 of the Coroners Act (NSW) 1960 (as amended).

* It is relevant to this debate because the so-called no work, no pay' direction was applied in a matter involving Australia Post and the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists which has been before  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples on a number of occasions.

* I suggest to honourable members opposite, many of whom have had successful business careers and many of whom when faced with questions of <span class="highlight">justice</span> and injustice fall on the side of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, that they should take away and examine very thoroughly this legislation to see what it really means to the people involved in terms of dollars and cents.

* The provisions of clause 20 requiring the Director-General to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the work of the Organization is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the discharge of its functions and that the Organization is kept free from any influences not relevant to its functions, follow closely the significant recommendations of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope in that regard.

* I should have thought that it would be abundantly clear to the Committee that, in a situation of excessive numbers, if an individual staff member is affected by an appeal brought by another staff member natural <span class="highlight">justice</span> requires that the staff member affected should have the right of audience before the appeal tribunal.

* I would like to have it made beyond doubt by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  that it would be unusual or extraordinary for a <span class="highlight">justice</span> to permit a listening device in the office of a solicitor who was acting for a client providing that in all cases he was not a participant in the commercial narcotic operations taking place.

* At a later stage in the Press statement he went on to say:  the main reason for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Wilson's appointment is that his conservative views, particularly on constitutional questions, are well known to, and appreciated by  Sir Charles.

* It should be noted that the previous Coal Industry Tribunal,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Gallagher, served as a judge of the New South Wales Industrial Commission from 1955 to 1957 and for many years from 1957 as a  deputy president  of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* I think there is a logical, sensible argument in terms of taxation, equity and social <span class="highlight">justice</span>, if I can put it that way, for the Government taking up a fair share of its burden and not trying to pass it on to the industry just because the industry is now going through a period of relative affluence.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0)

* I think the remarks made by the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Bonython about the proposed royal commission or extending the precise terms given to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams are unnecessary complications in a situation where we have to establish a group consisting of police officers who can ferret out the facts.

* We all know that in late 1977 the royal commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, was appointed to examine the drug problem and that was in conjunction with, I think, four States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0)

* The purpose of this Bill is to remove doubts that have arisen as to whether, as a matter of law, the provisions made by section 3 of the Judiciary (Diplomatic Representation) Act 1977 in relation to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox's service and salary while performing the functions of AmbassadoratLarge apply to his service under extensions of the original term of his appointment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox's term of appointment was extended from the original period of 12 months for a period of a little more than two months in October 1978 and for a period of some further five months in January 1 979. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* It is now proposed, and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has agreed, that his term be further extended from 8 June, when his present extension will expire, until the end of next year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* The doubts that have arisen are legal, technical matters and the Government feels that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox's rights should not be left in any doubt. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* When the 1977 Bill was before the Parliament the Government indicated that the time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox would be engaged on his work as Ambassador-at-Large would be at least 12 months, but might well be longer. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* Experience has proved this forecast to be correct and it has already been found desirable to extend  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox 's appointment beyond the initial period of 12 months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* The work on which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has been engaged as Ambassador-at-Large for nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards is, in the view of the Government, work of great national importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* Late last year  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox led the Australian delegation to the mid-term plenary conference of the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Government believes that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox will be able to make his own special contribution to policy in all these fields and will be an invaluable adviser to the Government on nuclear matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0)

* To the extent that this Bill proposes to rectify some possible deficiencies in the provision of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox as Ambassador-at-large the Opposition has no objection. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* The first thing I should say in relation to that is that the Opposition has considerable respect for the professional integrity and competence of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* After all, it was the Australian Labor Party when in government which appointed <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox to head the inquiry into uranium mining and export- generally the nuclear power industryand I believe his report was one of the more significant contributions towards the information of the public mind on this subject. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* The first concerns the duration of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* The second concerns the almost total dearth of information in relation to the cost associated with <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox's appointment and the discharge of his duty. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* Concerning the first matter, that is, the duration of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox's appointment, it is important to note that already his appointment has been extended on three occasions- from October 1978 to January 1979, from January 1979 to June 1979 and now it is being further extended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* We would prefer that any further extensions of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox should be the subject matter of Bills before the Parliament as has been the practice in the past so that proper debate can take place in relation to this very important matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* How much does it cost to support <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, his supporting staff and, I believe, his spouse, as he moves around the world as Ambassador-at-large- the man, as some have said, with the gold-plated airline ticket? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* So on three substantial grounds the Opposition is concerned about the conditions of appointment and operation of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* Secondly, the costs involved in supporting <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, his staff and his spouse as they fulfil their functions and move around the world in a style which, I would suggest, is far from austere and much more sufficient in the creature comforts provided than are available generally to the community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* Finally, is it correct, as we and a great many people in the community believe, that the Government has unfairly set up <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox as a sort of jet-setting front man to reassure a trusting public while the Government ignores the fundamental propositions he brings forward? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox's paper on international involvement in the regulation of the nuclear fuel cycle and the nuclear energy industry is, in my view, a seminal work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* However, the evidence available is that the Government has totally ignored what <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox has been doing and has encouraged him to move about fulfilling functions which it has defined but in which it is not the least bit interested. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* On that first ground, the matter of the duration of the appointment of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox, we will be moving appropriate amendments in the Committee stage. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* Despite the fact that he started by praising  His  Honour  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, who was appointed to the bench by the Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member and a senior Minister, he then referred to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as the man with the gold-plated airline ticket, the jet-setting front man. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* Those denigratory remarks can be regarded only as an attack upon  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and an endeavour to reduce the influence and authority of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox when he represents this country around the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* In fact, he knows so little about what is going on in this Parliament that he appeared to be completely unaware that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,  (Senator Button)  has a question on the Question Paper relating to the cost of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox's operations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* So, if the Opposition is so concerned about  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox and if what the Leader of the Opposition has said tonight has any truth and substance in it, why was it that it was not raised until one week ago and then not in this House but in another place? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* Whilst I cannot speak to the details on it, I can at least point out that if this amendment were to be agreed to, it would have the effect of fettering the continuing operations of  His  Honour,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, as Australia's Ambassador-at-Large. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* While the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  has indicated that the Opposition has no objection in principle to the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, on the very important question of an examination of the processes of nuclear industry, we do not believe that the question of the extension of his appointment ought just simply to be an exercise to be taken by the Executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* We believe that any extension of that appointment ought to come back to the Parliament so that the Parliament itself will have an opportunity to review the work, the activities and the achievements of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* But I say this: At a time when this Government is talking about cutbacks, and talking about economic stringencies, and is calling upon other sections of the Australian community to make sacrifices, it is not good enough for the Government to say that it will simply give a mandate to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, whatever his excellence and whatever his capacity, to operate at large and that the question of his reappointment for an indeterminate term will be a matter solely and exclusively for the Executive and not for the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* I believe that one of the failures in the appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox- and I do not believe it is his failure but the Government's failure- relates to the real benefits of his work, his real achievements and the importance of having him operating as Ambassador-at-Large. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0)

* The fact of the matter is that all those areas in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has been involved, and continues to be involved, are very much the subject of continuing debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* The problem is, whatever the nature of the report that comes from  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox, that it tends to stay within the ambit of the executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* I would have thought that if we are spending the amount of money that it costs to have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox operate as an ambassador-at-large, then the information that he gleans as an ambassador-at-large ought not to be available just simply to the executive of the day but also ought to be available to the Parliament and through the Parliament, it ought to be available to the people of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* What is the range of issues which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox has pointed out in the past? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* 
 - Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Fox. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* It is all very well to have  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox operating as a public relations arm of this Government so that he will prove or substantiate its view. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* The reality, of course, is that most of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox's recommendations are honoured more in the breach than in their observance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* As far as one of his colleagues is concerned,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox ought to be sacked. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* The honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr)  shows their real attitude to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* The Government believes that so long as it can keep  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox as ambassador-at-large wandering around the world he can produce as many memoranda as he likes, he can tell the Government of the problems and the threats that are posed to the people of Australia by nuclear profliferation, he can tell the people of Australia and the Government that we have not solved the problems of nuclear waste disposal, he can point out all these problems, but they will stay within the confines of the Cabinet. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

* Therefore, I commend this amendment to the House because what it says is that the Parliament ultimately will accept responsibility for the extension of the appointment or any further appointment of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Fox. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-45)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* In this regard  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope stated: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* We are not prepared to leave this legislation unchallenged because the present operators responsible for ASIO, the Attorney-General,  Senator Durack,  and the Director-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, are men of integrity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* But, more importantly, neither  Senator Durack  nor  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward is immortal and there will be other men working under the provisions of this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Indeed, I think it is more difficult than was recognised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope himself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* But even if this relationship is satisfactorily solved, if both the Nixon danger and the Salisbury danger are avoided- that is, if we get a satisfactory balance between the Executive and the agency- the problem is not solved because, as <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope notes in his third report, often the Executive becomes very perfunctory about its responsibilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* I think it must be said of <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope that he is rather cavalier about the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Whilst <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope dismisses all of these proposals for the Parliament to play a role in ASIO- he says that none of those things are possible and that Parliament cannot play a rolebut at the same time he maintains that ASIO has a role in supervising individual politicians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Unfortunately, because of what <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope said, in this Bill the Government gives no role whatsoever to the Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* I speak as one who recalls very vividly the raid on ASIO by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Indeed, we are lucky, as I think previous speakers on both sides of the House and speakers in the other place have acknowledged, that the current Director-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, is a person of great integrity and a person who will carry out his duties as this Parliament would like to see them carried out. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Indeed, the history of ASIO goes back to 1949 when the then Prime Minister sent a letter to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed appointing him Director-General of Security and requesting him to establish and operate a security service. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* By this time  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Reed had been replaced by the then  Colonel C.  C. F. Spry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White, in his inquiry into the situation in South Australia, found as follows: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* That is the way in which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White found. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* I was concerned to hear him argue so illogically that the same sorts of standards and prescriptions that apply to a company or a trade union- which is a public organisation, a voluntary organisation, like a company, with rules laid down- ought to apply to a security service, in the face of the findings of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and in the face of all the body of accumulated evidence that the laws have been broken and the rights of the ordinary citizen have been transgressed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* But are we proposing anything more than a periodic investigation of the kind made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, an updating of his report? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

 Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope also stated that he rejects the view that espionage is not a significant problem in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Essentially we must remember that ASIO is an intelligence organisation; it is not a court of <span class="highlight">justice</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope also said: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* In the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found that in the final analysis Ministers are the ones for whom intelligence advice is produced. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* In his report  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope implied that ASIO may have exceeded its powers and engaged in activities irrelevant to its functions and which may have impinged on individual freedom. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* But I do believe that we could quite easily have recourse to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court of Australia- not to a Supreme Court of a State or anyone else but to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court of Australia- in matters such as this. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said about the general level of political sophistication inside ASIO that he saw little evidence that the qualities of mind and expertise needed in intelligence assemblies were recognised in any large measure.

* We are also told that we should accept that the present DirectorGeneral of ASIO,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, is a man of integrity and that we can trust him not to carry out any of the excesses of his predecessors in office. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* I have great admiration for  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward and can only express my amazement that the Fraser Government has left him in his position. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* Let me give honourable members a horrific example from a democratic country of how an essentially paranoid view about secrecy can create general hysteria and distort and pervert the traditional norms of law and <span class="highlight">justice</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* I ask leave of the House to incorporate in  Hansard  paragraphs 208 to 221 of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope's fourth report on the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* I conclude from my reading of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope's report that ASIO in its present form lacks the sophistication and capacity to evaluate that we should expect from an intelligence organisation.

* These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security constituted by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, after a most thorough investigation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0)

* I indicated that the Bill does give effect substantially to the second and fourth reports of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security headed by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* The published and unpublished- I stress the unpublished partreports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope are a disturbing documentation of a security service that had been in disarray, a security service that lived on a reputation that was undeserved in the 1960s and early 1970s. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* In the past-  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope established this- ASIO was a badly demoralised organisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* Again, in the published reports of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope it is clear that ASIO had been engaging in illegal activities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* Ordinary <span class="highlight">justice</span> demands that the public must be protected against the misuse of information gathered by ASIO for sinister and often petty political vendettas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* Even  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope found that ASIO's financial procedures are capable of some improvement, though we are not told why. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* No one doubts the integrity and sincerity of the present Director-General,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward, but some powers of his office which the Minister cannot override may require some final check or audit. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* I close in congratulating the Royal Commission under  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope for its deliberations and findings, the governments which initiated the inquiry and accepted the Commission's reports, and those who have, in the public interest, examined the implications and voiced their fears and concerns. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0)

* I had proposed to ask the head of my Department to seek the assistance of the Public Service Board in this review, but I was aware that the Federal Narcotics Bureau falls also within the terms of reference of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and that the Royal Commissioner,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams, therefore, could be making recommendations in relation to it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0)

* Rather than wait until then, I raised with the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  the question whether we might seek  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams' views on matters relating to the organisation and control of the Narcotics Bureau ahead of his final report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Government raised the matter formally with  His Excellency  the Governor-General and with the Royal Commissioner with the result that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams agreed that he would provide an interim report dealing with these matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0)

* Because it is an interim report and the subject will be fully covered in the final Royal Commission report, and because the Royal Commissioner has included in the interim report a number of matters of confidential evidence and observations which ordinarily would not be made public,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Williams has preferred that this interim report be treated as confidential. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0)

* After a long lapse of time there was a judicial audit of that State 's intelligence organisation and  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White clearly indicated that there had been a failure to understand what intelligence organisations are supposed to do. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

* As evidenced by the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White, files were collected on people simply because they went to a meeting suggesting that peace might break out in the world or they went to a communist book shop or they belonged to the Australian Labor Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

* The report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White gives, for the first time, an independent analysis of what was happening when this organisation or its equivalent was endeavouring to function.

* He then goes on, and I must say I disagree with this statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

* I will sum up my feelings by referring to the words of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, which reflect exactly how I felt at the time and what I hoped would be the way in which he would report. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

* The second point that was made by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope was that ASIO had been guilty in the past of departure from its basic functions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

* One other matter to which  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope referred was also a worry to me. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

* I believe that the responsibility for drafting the definition should be taken away for the moment from the Parliamentary Counsel and submitted to an independent senior counsel, either in New South Wales or Victoria, to draft clauses which would bring these powers within the total concept of the Bill and ensure that there is <span class="highlight">justice</span> and that there is proper control of the exercising of these powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30)

* In that regard I would have liked to have seen the use of words much the same as those used by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  in the amendment he moved to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, that is, that there should be periodical judicial audits- again I emphasise that they should be only by a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Federal Court- to ensure that the work of the Organisation complies with its charter and the law, that it does not unjustifiably infringe civil liberties, which is the most important matter of them all, and that it operates effectively and efficiently.

* The investigations by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope and in South Australia by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  White and  Mrs <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Mitchell provided salutary lessons in the value of a judicial audit or a review of our security processes.

* As I said earlier, it was, in fact, a recommendation of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope that the word be used in the juxtaposition of the three fundamental elements of the meaning of subversion as provided for in clause 5 ( 1 ) (a). [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36)

* Because of an accident of numbers some years ago which denied the then government a majority membership of the Senate and, I think it is fair to say, because of the reformist zeal of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Murphy when Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and of other members of the Senate, the Senate's procedures have changed dramatically over the last 10 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0)

* For example, in the report of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope the second definition of 'subversion' is given as overthrow by force and undermining by unlawful means and the definition of 'subversive activity ' is given as overthrow of the Constitution by revolution or sabotage, overthrow by force or violence and destruction of Commonwealth property.

* The upshot of the conclusion by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope is that intelligence collected by ASIO could be referred to the Department of Industrial Relations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39)

* It states that it may be fair enough to collect intelligence on the activities of people within trade unions, but I do not think that our amendment conflicts in any way with what  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope said about the communication of intelligence about trade unions or with what ASIO said when it put up some definition of subversion to the Royal Commission.

* It is little wonder that we of the Opposition do not trust the objectivity of ASIO's agents when we look at that sort of material which has been written by the learned <span class="highlight">Justice</span> Hope and, I add, the report on which this legislation is based.

* If that argument is seriously put forward, then it follows that members of the Labor Party, trade union officials, are quite justified in believing that if they went before the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, who went from a senior position as a Liberal Minister in this Parliament to the position of Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>, there would be no fairness nor any <span class="highlight">justice</span> for them.

* I refer to a question asked of me at Question Time today by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  in which he asked whether any member of my staff made available copies of a statement by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples dated 28 September 1979 concerning the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that were then before the House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0)

* I turn now to what the Leader of the Opposition said about allegations regarding  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples' comments, namely, that there was an implied threat to  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples in my mentioning that I referred  His  Honour's letter to the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  for the Attorney-General's comment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0)

* In view of the questions raised about the constitutionality or otherwise of the amendments, naturally I wanted the Attorney-General to look specifically at the points raised by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0)

* I have now received the Attorney-General's comments and he has reaffirmed the advice which I gave earlier and which he gave to me; that is, that there is nothing in  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples' comments in his letter which would lead the Attorney-General to change his advice to the Government that the amendments are in fact constitutional. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0)

* The Government is confident that the legislation will stand up to a High Court challenge, and has dismissed  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Staples' criticisms by pointing out that he is a former member of the Communist Party. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0)

* In April 1 979, 26 judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court including the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Sir Laurence  Street signed a letter which was critical of a proposal by New South Wales Attorney-General  Mr Walker  to create a new Criminal Law Division in the Supreme Court. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0)

* It is important to note that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his very comprehensive suggestions for the definition of subversion', did not include in that definition the words 'promoting hatred between different groups of persons in the Australian community'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33)

* So, insofar as the Government itself has relied very much on the authority of  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, it is not justified in doing so in this case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33)

* Thus this House should support the Opposition amendment because inciting hatred between groups is very difficult to define; secondly,  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope has not recommended this in the definition; and thirdly, it strikes at the heart of the conflicted political system that we have.

* Unfortunately the very personal qualities that make  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward an admirable Director-General of Security I believe are wrongly put about in this debate by honourable members saying: 'There is nothing to worry about in the legislation; do not worry about it because we have such an excellent DirectorGeneral, somebody appointed by the Labor Government and kept on by the present Government.

* This Bill does not give us any guarantee of that, but  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, in his report, said: 'Well, look, I can visualise in some cases a DirectorGeneral using his discretion and not giving any information, but the Prime Minister has to get that information'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33)

* The sub judice rule will prevent discussion of trial proceedings in respect of those 2 1 people and maybe another 1 32 people if they do go before the court, and for the very good reason that the sub judice rule is intended to protect the national interest- if I might put it this way- in the purity of the administration of <span class="highlight">justice</span>, against it being subverted by comment within this Parliament.

* The first point I would make is that in respect of committal proceedings- perhaps I have a higher view of magistrates exercising their responsibilities in those matters- my own view would be that anything that was stated in this Parliament would not affect a magistrate making a determination on the basis of the evidence before him, any more than it would affect a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of the Supreme Court or, indeed, even of a Full Court.

* It is clear that  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Hope, as he has done on previous occasions on matters of great public responsibility, where he has had a brief to carry out a review of such matters, has again in this report performed his task diligently, intelligently and with considerable beneficial effect for those people in the community, in government and other institutions serving government in the community who have to take decisions in these matters and have to respond to actual problems which may arise affecting security or prepare for the potential that may rest within the community from whatever cause for that sort of threat.

* If we had a permanent appraisal of the situation we would go very close to giving these criminals the <span class="highlight">justice</span> they deserve. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66)

* (b) The Government approved a recommendation of the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-41)

* The view was taken by  Mr <span class="highlight">Justice</span>  Woodward in his report- he was asked to report only on the Northern Territory- that an examination of the State position would take much longer but that what was done in the Northern Territory would provide something of a precedent.

* Further, if we are to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to the work of the Joint Committee and other committees in this place, we ought to be given the opportunity in a reasonable way to receive reports and to comment on them.

* To suggest that the Committee thought that does not help the situation and I am surprised that the Chief <span class="highlight">Justice</span> of the Federal Court of Australia would create the impression, probably unwisely, that members of Parliament would take lawful or unlawful means to avoid publicly declaring their interests.

* With respect to countries which may not share the basic criminal <span class="highlight">justice</span> system applicable in Australia, very careful consideration would have to be given to the basis for any transfer arrangements to ensure that persons transferred from Australia not only received treatment in accordance with our notions of penal <span class="highlight">justice</span> but that they would also be required to undergo imprisonment for a sufficient period, in accordance with their Australian sentence, to deter them from breaches of Australia's fisheries legislation in the future.

* I hope that the Minister will carefully watch the operation of the Act in regard to a <span class="highlight">justice</span> of a particular area, say the Northern Territory, issuing a warrant relating to the whole of Australia.
