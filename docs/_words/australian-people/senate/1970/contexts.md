* It is supposed to be a prices Act, but that is not altogether an accurate description, and I raise for the Committee's attention the question whether it is fair to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to suggest that the word 'prices' should be the word which covers so many things which may be comprehended by the use of the word. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56)

* Firstly, it makes a mockery of the prices justification legislation which was introduced earlier this year, because if the Commonwealth Government did not have the power to pass that legislation, what does it mean by imposing a fraud upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by suggesting that legislation of that character could be efficacious? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56)

* I put it to the Senate that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reject this proposition for 8 main reasons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* 1 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reject this Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* A third reason is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be entitled to conclude on all evidence on all sides that the granting of this power and its use is not in itself the answer to the problem of inflation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0)

* I hope that we will get on with the job in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that we will do it rapidly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* Very often we cannot tell whether a referendum will go through because there is a caution in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when it comes to fiddling around with the Constitution which was given such a great deal of thought when it was first created. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* Secondly, the very existence of that house of review ensures that any legislation that may be introduced by a majority government in the House of Representatives must have time to mature and to become known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before it is debated in the second chamber, which is the Senate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* Secondly, I am confident that the Australian Labor Party will never be given power over prices in the Federal sphere while the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the right to deny the Labor Party that power. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* I think that the solution which hasbeen offered now, althouth it may not be theone which was totally acceptable to us, is atleast reasonably acceptable to us and is acceptable to the Government, and it rests within thedisposition of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to whetherthey confer on the national Parliament both powers, neither power or one power or the other. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0)

* If this Bill- the Constitution Alteration (Prices) Bill having passed a little earlier- is passed by the Senate before the Parliament rises this week, and we hope that it will now be passed this evening, both proposals can be submitted together to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their decision before Christmas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the inflation rate stopped now- not in 6 months time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0)

* However, as this matter has been raised by the Opposition I think it is worth while taking a little time to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Opposition that in fact the percentage of the Australian gross national product now being spent by this Government on defence is greater than the percentage of the gross national product spent by the previous Government in any financial year between 1959 and 1963- and it was very little higher than the present figure at any stage during the life of the previous Government.

* If it did nothing else, the role that it played in ending the Vietnam war and the role that it played in seeing that sensible relations exist between this country and China, Vietnam and East Germany would be abiding memorials to this Government and of permanent benefit to the peace of the world and the security of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I suggest that what I am saying is of great significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because in the past the Senate has been used to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I want to ensure that this is not allowed to continue.

* These, very generally stated, are that the functions of the National Library are, working on behalf of the Commonwealth, to maintain and develop a national collection of library material, including a comprehensive collection of library material relating to Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; to make library material available and to provide for the advantageous use of any collections in the Library in the national interest; to make available such other services in relation to library matters and library material for the purposes of the Parliamentary Library, the departments and authorities of the Commonwealth and the Territories of the Commonwealth; and finally to cooperate in library matters, including the advancement of library science, with authorities or persons, whether in Australia or elsewhere.

* I ask: In view of the importance of ascertaining and publishing the true facts for proper assessment by the Parliament and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will the Federal Government produce as a matter of some urgency a White Paper or a considered statement in particular, clarifying the repeated allegations that the Allende Government in the latter part of its period of office had abandoned democratic processes, the basis of its election, and was imposing dictatorial and totalitarian methods upon the Chilean people?

* I suggest that the reason the Government has not reintroduced the Bill is because it recognises that the points made by the Opposition had validity, and there was a realistic recognition that if those points of validity were not accepted by the Government they would be accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.

* I am sure it is not perfect, but set against other examples of administration of countries by overseas powers in what might be called a colonial style- I never cared for it but, never mind, we had a kind of guardianship situation in Papua New Guinea- I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> performed the function well, they discharged it with dignity, they dug fairly deeply into their own pockets to fund the development of Papua New Guinea, and I think that it stands to our credit both with the people of Papua New Guinea and with ourselves, and it certainly stands to our credit with the United Nations and those observers who have been to Papua New Guinea from time to time to witness the progress of that country.

* In effect, the Government is pledging Australia's credit to a new and independent State, and it is a mark of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>'s confidence and willingness to stay in the game of Papua New Guinea that they will give such guarantees.

* For the Senate to delay this Bill, in my view, is an act of economic sabotage against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and honourable senators opposite stand condemned, and they will stand condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, for their delaying tactics in relation to this important piece of legislation.

* The first thing that I believe has to be said- this has to be repeated- is that the policy which has been put forward in the Schools Commission Bill 1973 is Australian Labor Party policy which was well known and clearly presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before they voted in the election on 2 December 1972.

* Any proposition which was put forward by way of amendment or any other way which suggested that this responsibility did not exist and that there was just a general responsibility to students would be contrary to the policy on which we were elected, contrary to the trust which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> reposed in us and contrary to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who voted for this policy when they elected the Labor Government on 2 December 1972.

* Having been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare which inquired at length into the problems of the physically and mentally handicapped, I echo the remarks of  Senator Jessop  when I say frankly that I am very proud that the Government of which I am a member has taken heed of the very detailed and voluminous report which was arrived at collectively and unanimously by the members of that Committee, who were of all political persuasions, after they had taken evidence at length from a large cross-section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who represent the physically and mentally handicapped section, particularly the handicapped children, in our community.

* In seeking Australian Government control and direction of our fuel resources, I have been concerned naturally to reduce our dependency on Middle East crude and this concern is reflected in the provisions of the Pipeline Authority Act 1 973 requiring the Authority to secure, control and retain reserves of petroleum adequate to meet the long term needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.

* Because there has been a substantial increase in the number of broadcasting stations and television stations and because the workload now thrown on the Broadcasting Control Board is significantly greater than it was a decade ago, it is only natural that an increase in the revenue required to enable the Broadcasting Control Board to continue to give the very effective service that it gives to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is necessary.

* To put it in other terms, unless this chamber is prepared to rubber stamp entirely that which the Minister requires, the Minister will not go on with what is regarded by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and apparently by the lower House- and this would be the majority view of this chamber- as something which is desirable in the interests of education of Australia, that is, the creation of a schools commission.

* We believe that that as a wording of the first function of the Commission is more desirable, more comprehensive and more in accord with both the recommendations of the Karmel Committee and the desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the State governments- which are, as we have mentioned already, directly concerned with the administration of so much of the education in Australia- than is the provision drafted by the Government.

* It shows the complete absurdity of this legislation and the complete ignorance of members of this Government and certainly the Minister who does not seem to be able to look beyond the interests of his coal kingdom in Wollongong when he thinks that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that the laws to cover these vast areas of Australia should be made by applying the law of the Australian Capital Territory.

* Not only does the Government want to strip the States of all power as has been indicated in different legislation which has been before this chamber, but also on Saturday week at a referendum the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to decide whether this Australian Parliament and Government will be given full control over prices and wages.

* Australian living standards over a long period of years have been based upon Australian growth which has been supported in 2 ways- firstly, very substantially by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of reinvestment in their own country and secondly by the augmentation of capital and know-how from overseas, and that must not be forgotten in what might be called an excess of economic nationalism.

* I think that is a fairly reasonable and rational statement of concern by the life offices, which as I said earlier, hold a huge amount of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>'s savings- the savings of literally millions of people, most of whom have invested small amounts of money.

* These people will have access to a huge resource- a huge proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>'s savings- and the economic consequences of their investment programs may be much less important to them than would be shown in the kind of approach that would be made to investment by the people who are currently on the Board. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0)

* If the Government decides that it wants something done and some part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>'s savings used to do it and if the proposal is not regarded as a good commercial operation and no one else will touch it-the AIDC may not want to do it, but the Government could say: 'You have to do it'- the Government should be responsible for that decision, that money, and what happens to that money.

* I am not here to interpret the Prime Minister's words, but I think it may be fair to say that in this instance the Prime Minister was voicing the viewpoint that would be shared by most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that is, that the pilots would be expected to exercise common sense, that where a safety issue was raised it would be dealt with in the normal and proper way under the procedures which are laid down by law, and that the pilots would resume and carry on their duties.

* Again, in the case of the arts there is not a concentration of arbitrary power in the hands of ministers or permanent heads of departments, but an effort to bring broad sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the fields in which they are interested and active into consultation with the Government.

* Is it an arbitrary or excessive power to introduce legislation such as the Trade Practices Bill in order to break down the power of economic monopolies and oligopolies which rule the economic life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; to see that the people can participate in a private enterprise economy, which we still have, on a basis of some equality, or to remove a situation in which there is not government regulation but regulation by private monopolies about which the previous Government said it was going to do something but about which it did nothing?

* I believe that one reason for the failure of the present Government to take advantage of the opportunity which we have given it for a double dissolution is this: The Government knows that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are appalled at the power hungry character of the Government in Canberra and it is not game to go to the people to get their verdict. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0)

* What honourable senators opposite are complaining about is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> since 2 December have had an activist government which wishes to make available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> all the fruits of the opportunities which nature has given them- a government which wishes to make them available to the people of this country untrammelled by sellouts to overseas companies which was par for the course during the previous Government's day.

* It may well be that other methods, other formulae, which do not have these overtones and cause apprehension and concern, may be discovered which would substantially giver effect to what is the commonly held desire of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, namely, that as far as possible we should maximise Australian control and ownership of our resources and at the same time not deter the investment of foreign capital in Australia.

* To go around, in regard to this measure and in regard to another measure that is before this chamber, preaching this song about how necessary it is for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own their own resources and in the process of getting them back to automatically nationalise them is, in my opinion, a very snide trick indeed.

* In the last 18 months since this Government was elected in 1 972 it has sought to implement the mandate that was given to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but these 10 senators have been sitting in judgment and have been attempting to nullify and to destroy the mandate that was given to the Government by the people of Australia.

* The Opposition was not only unconcerned that its own Senate Select Committee had concluded after inquiry that the AIDC and the Australian Resources Development Bank were far too insignificant to be considered a major force in the capital market and recommended that the 'activities of both these two bodies be expanded further', but also unconcerned too that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were appalled at the sell-out of Australia and wanted something to be done.

* The defence statement which has been read to us this afternoon is a fair indication of the panic of this Government now that it has come to the realisation that within a few weeks it will have to face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and account for its activities over the last 14 or 15 months. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0)

* This evening their remarks have been practically the same word for word, parrot style, as the remarks which were made in this chamber on 1 1 December, I think it was, when legislation of this nature was put forward by the Government after it had received a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1972. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40)

* The reason we put this legislation forward now is that we realise that the Opposition parties have said they will vote against the Supply Bills when they come into the Senate and we want to prove that we have done our very utmost for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to satisfy them that we have tried. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40)

* From the remarks that they have tendered in the Senate today one would gain the impression that if by some mischance at some future election they were re-elected to government they would continue with the hopeless, maladministered ramshackle scheme that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had to put up with for so long.

* I have not had time to read in depth the recommendations in that report but it would seem to me that it was necessary for the Government to have that information before it drew up the guidelines for the scheme which it has presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which will leave such gaps in the accommodation which is available at present.

* I think that the policy which we promoted during out term of government is the correct one, that is, to encourage Australian equity but not to force the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to provide finance or to insist upon a particular amount being provided for mineral development.

* If this matter is as serious as honourable senators opposite are making it out to be- if they say that what they are doing tonight will be a challenge to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a challenge to the Australian trade union movement and a challenge to the Australian white collar workers- the problem will not be solved by pegging the wages of 187 people and agreeing to increases for thousands of people.

* On very many occasions the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber  (Senator Withers)  and the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  in the other place clearly said to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: 'We want to test this Government at the electorate level, and we want the people of Australia to vote and pass judgment'.

* I think it is a little strange that it took the ALP as long as it did to get on to the idea that section 96 could be used to solve the real problem that it has, namely, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want it to change the constitutional structure of Australia.

* Speaking on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Withers),  I point out that the proposal embodied in this Bill was submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referendum not 9 months ago and on that occasion the people of Australia said no. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0)

* It seems to be a strange twist of logic that 29 members of the Government Party are doing their utmost to establish conditions which will virtually say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Senate, as a responsible brake in the Australian parliamentary system, is totally unnecessary and we do not need it.

* On the grounds that the legislation is unnecessary- there is no clamour for it- that it has been rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> less than 12 months ago, that it would destroy the very significance of the Senate in the Australian parliamentary system and thereby be the prelude to its abolition and that it would deny the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to pass judgment on the government of the day as it proceeds along its course, I strongly oppose the Bill.

* Indeed, if we contribute to the research of the world so that in future a tonne of coal will be equal to 3, 4 or 5 tonnes now, we not only conserve coal but we raise the international value of a tonne of coal and therefore convert it, in terms of the profit it makes, into real things for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.

* By various sorts of incentives, as that Government's supporters called them, and by its inability to claim proper royalties for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it let its multinational friends dig great holes in the ground, take away the minerals and sell them at a very great profit to themselves.

 Senator Everett and other speakers on behalf of the Government say that that is a jolly good thing, that Utah Corporation and other multinational companies are ripping off and raking off giant profits and it is good that we are going to get $ 120m out of them for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.

* But I wish to observe to my colleagues in the Senate that the reason why the Opposition has taken its position is because of the incompetence of the Government, the economic mess that it has created, the unemployment that it has brought about, the inflation that it has engendered and the state of lack of confidence and disaster in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> find themselves.

* It is interesting to reflect on the fact that in 1949 it was the American State Department that suggested to the Australian Government that there was a need to establish an intelligence organisation in Australia that would be able to have passed to it information which would be of value from the American point of view and in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.

* This may be obvious to us all but I am quite sure that for the last 3 years the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were lulled into some acceptance of the fact that there was absolutely no limit to the distribution of funds and of financial resources.

* Whilst those recommendations are in abeyance- the IAC reported on the dairy industry after considering the matter for21/2 years- and because of the indolence of the present Federal Government in failing to announce any recommendations to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> arising from the report of the IAC into the dairy industry, the New South Wales Government has decided to hold an inquiry into the state of the dairy industry in New South Wales.

* At a time when we have more than enough economic and social problems to keep us fully occupied, it may seem untimely to ask the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give some thought to longer term population goals and growth rates including the desirable size and composition of our population at various stages up to the end of this century.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0)

* For the Minister when introducing the Bill to suggest that there is some upturn in private sector housing and that, therefore, this will provide opportunities for the great bulk of the Australian population, indicates that he does not understand that, because of the prevailing economic conditions, at least half of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to have their accommodation provided for them by public housing instrumentalities.

* If it is felt, by any people whose basic motivations are to give a cultural gloss to what is essentially a rather sordid trade relationship, that by establishing this Foundation we can really help to interest <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a significant way or Japanese people in a significant way in the respective cultures of the 2 countries, we make a very grave mistake.

* An indication of the present Government's vehement dislike for anything owned and operated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is afforded by the remarks of an honourable gentleman in the other place who represents the Federal division of Swan when he was speaking in the debate on these Bills in the lower House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0)

* I do not think I need to say a great deal more than that, except perhaps once again to reiterate that at a time like this we ought to be very conscious of the debt incurred by governments on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being raised totally, being examined by the Loan Council, always being consolidated, and being properly and regularly paid off to those who have lent the money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0)

* I want to know where are the instant and automatic increases in pensions, because the impression that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gained was that if the Liberal and National Country parties came to power there would be instant and automatic increases in pensions whenever there was an increase in the cost of living index.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0)

* The reason why this statement has been made about the continuation of that benefit for a period of 12 weeks is to enable the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and those other people who are concerned to understand that it is not one week that is given as a gesture but it is 12 weeks that has been given as a gesture thus enabling the readjustment of expenditure in the case of married persons to be undertaken without undue hardship.

* I repeat that the Whitlam Labor Government doubled the take on sales tax, doubled the take on customs duties, forced the States into putting up their indirect taxes and charges and, in fact, by any calculation made the tax impost on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by far the heaviest.

* The Prime Minister has talked about making more money available to the States and, according to his several pronouncements, he is going to put more into the pay packet, the hip pocket, of the average wage earner and at the same time maintain the services which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have demanded recognition and which they think ought to be provided in the public sector.

* Far from this being something which can be turned against politicians by saying that we do not want more of them so we should vote against the proposal, I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be ready to say that we have had over the years too many elections and too often and that situation will be solved by the proposed constitutional amendment.

* When the Government was elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it was elected to carry out its vows during its term of office in a responsible way, and I would suggest that does not give it an unfettered right to carry on actions when there is clear evidence of a large degree of dissent from those actions among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.

* My real concern is that the very person who is now buying off Australian sport- 1 am talking of Kerry Packer- is endeavouring to convince this Government that it should subsidise the establishment in Australia of a satellite communications system which not only will have the effect of creating difficulties within the communication area but also will present the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a national captive audience in respect of advertising. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2)

* If there is not a bipartisan policy on security, if there is a party or a group of parties within Australia representing about half of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who believe that ASIO is not acting properly, that ASIO is a weapon that is being used against them, we will have an ineffective ASIO.

* We have expressed in a variety of ways our concern at the actions of the Queensland Government which have clearly been designed to circumvent the wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as expressed some 12 years ago, that the Commonwealth Government should accept responsibility for our Aboriginal communities.

* Today we have added to the debate on this subject by reminding the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of just how long-running and scandalous a sore this question of misuse of Federal funds has been in the best known context of them all- the use by Victoria of Federal funds for land purchase.

* Until our amendments are written into the legislation that is now before the chamber or until the present legislation is withdrawn and redrafted to contain the provisions set out in our amendments, the Labor movement will not be satisfied that the political rights and civil liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are protected by the legislation.

* The introduction of the Parliament House Construction Authority Bill seems a formality but, in real terms, it will provide a starting point to which <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will look as long as there is an Australia, as long as Australia has a Parliament and as long as Australia has a parliament house. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0)

* Because it is deficient in so many respects including the 1 1 points we have set out in the Opposition 's amendment, I suggest that the Senate should support the amendment and demand the withdrawal of the Bill and the redrafting of it to provide for the protection of the civil liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the right of parliament to be informed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50)

* The fundamental flaw in the legislation now before the chamber is that practically no attempt has been made by this Government to establish any fundamental watchdog procedures that would constrain ASIO within the bounds of the law and within the wishes of the Parliament and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0)

* So those people who have been trying to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- and I am talking now about the so-called pro-nuclear experts- over a long period that it is for the good of this country that we should mine our uranium are probably amongst the minority of people in the world who are totally dedicated to mining without realising that the safeguards have not been properly carried out, will not be properly carried out and that major accidents may happen around the world.

* Indeed, my hackles rise at some of the assertions made in it because they seem to me to be a follow-up to what has been a policy of gradualism in this Parliament over the past year to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe through several statements, Dorothy Dix questions and the like that even the air they and their children breathe must be foul and polluted in the interests of a spurious, false and rather ignoble cause.

* What is very important to understand is that already the effect of our policies has been for the oil companies themselves not only to extend their sphere of exploration but also to exploit existing oil wells far beyond the levels of their former profitability, therefore giving to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some years extra assurance of oil.

* Not only has the Australian Broadcasting Commission's ability to broadcast sporting matters been taken away from it but also, as a result of the cut in its expenditure and the severe staff ceilings that have been imposed upon it, the news service which it is able to offer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which it was offering on a completely independent basis when the Labor Government was in office is in jeopardy.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0)

* At the beginning of my speech I said that there was a dichotomy between protecting the interests of the people of Norfolk Island and giving them as much self-government as possible- perhaps more than the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  would desireand recognising at the same time that the standards which are applicable to the Norfolk Island people should be as far as practicable the same as the standards which are applicable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in matters such as income tax and social welfare legislation.
