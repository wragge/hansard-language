* The most obvious exercise that has ever been undertaken to ensure that many candidates contest a ballot in order to bemuddle the people was undertaken, of course, during the Senate selection that was conducted together with the House of Representatives election following the double dissolution in 1974 in relation to which a political research team discovered that the Australian Labor Party would lose 80 per cent of the additional informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> for every candidate above the number of 40 who ran at that election.

* That proposition is put forward simply in connection with the motion which was moved elsewhere and is in line with the Opposition's view that in a condition of compulsory voting there should be no restriction on the facilities that are provided and that therefore the cut-off time at the end of the polling day- be it 8 o'clock or 6 o'clock ultimately- will represent the end of the receipt of <span class="highlight">votes</span> that can be included in the count.

* By looking at the figures concerning postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> that were cast one can see how expert the political parties of Australia are becoming at going around hospitals, nursing homes and old folks' homes trying to make people vote when in fact they do not want to vote or they have an excuse for not voting.

* Briefly, the reason for closing off this section is to prevent things happening such as that which the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  admitted he was an expert in doing- the canvassing of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, the applications being freely available, the forms being available from year to year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26)

* That advertisement by the honourable member for Griffith about postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> goes terribly close to breaching the Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26)

* One has only to look at the voting returns for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and the pattern of voting to be able to see that some extraneous influence is being brought to bear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26)

* My scrutineers reported to me that the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> coming in for the Liberal candidate from the first batches of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>- these were the first postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> put out and were ones that had been solicited- showed a pattern of voting much more in favour of the Liberal candidate than was the voting trend in any sub-division in the whole electorate.

* What we will never be able to do by legislation is to prevent candidates of any political party compiling special lists of names of people who are known to be infirm or ill whom they then canvass to solicit their <span class="highlight">votes</span>.

* In Western Australia we have seen several things of note happen: Firstly, the rather unusual circumstances surrounding the appointment of the Western Australian commissioners; secondly, the results of the boundaries of a special redistribution in Western Australia in which the Government gained nearly 60 per cent of the seats on 44 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

* Thirdly, in a count of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the seat of Stirling- which, as honourable members will be aware, ran to within a margin of 12 <span class="highlight">votes</span>- we saw a recount discovering that many <span class="highlight">votes</span> or one or two more in ballot papers which up to then had been counted a number of times. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

* I refer also to the refusal of the opportunity to scrutineer a recount of the Western Australian Senate <span class="highlight">votes</span> in spite of the fact that that count was carried over many days making it impracticable for any party to have it scrutineered- there were also many complaints from electoral officers that they were tired and working under difficult conditions- and in spite of the fact that a recount was allowed at an earlier Senate election for an objecting Australian Labor Party candidate, when the percentage difference was greater than was the case in the last Western Australian Senate election. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

* But all of those good <span class="highlight">votes</span> have been thrown out because somewhere about 73 or 74 the voters became tired and neglected to put a number on the ballot paper or put the same number in twice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

* Next, there is the question of an earlier deadline for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and for the return of those <span class="highlight">votes</span> direct to the respective returning officers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

* I can see advantage in returning postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> direct to the respective returning officers because this might save a little time instead of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> being handed into an assistant officer in the United States of America, England or wherever it may be.

* It is proposed that instead of having up to 10 days after the end of voting for the postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> to come in that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> should have to be in by the same time as the ballot closes on the Saturday night.

* Certainly so far as the Liberal-Country Party is concerned, I have no doubt that we lose a large number of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, from which we score heavily, because our people do not know the affiliation of the particular candidates for whom they are voting.

* I do not believe that anybody could criticise the efficiency of the Electoral Office in counting the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, but under the laws we made in this Parliament it was impossible to get a new Parliament until 3 months had elapsed since the previous Parliament had been dissolved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

* It is absurd that at least 10 per cent and possibly nearer 20 per cent of electors should have their Senate <span class="highlight">votes</span> rejected as informal because the task of filling out their mammoth ballot-papers correctly has exceeded their understanding or exhausted their patience. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0)

* The present system whereby a period of grace of 10 days after polling day is allowed for the receipt of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> by the relevant divisional returning officer of <span class="highlight">votes</span> posted direct to him is seen by the Government as a major problem, especially in [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28)

* The Government's argument in respect of this clause and a number of others- those relating to postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and those relating to other matters, such as the reduction in the hours of polling and in other procedures- is that they are all aimed at getting a quicker result. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0)

* However, the saving in informal voting which must result from the acceptance of ballot papers which, although bearing a first preference, do not indicate preferences for all candidates, can be expected to offset <span class="highlight">votes</span> which become exhausted.

* These faculties, together with the availability of modern day private and public transport, are adequate to enable electors to conveniently record their <span class="highlight">votes</span>, and effectively eliminates the need to keep the polling booths open until 8 p.m. A by-product of the earlier closing hour is that the scrutiny can commence 2 hours earlier with the result that the counting trend for which the nation is waiting is known much earlier in the night of polling day.

* The establishment of mobile polling booths in hospitals is a vital reform, one which would permit polling officials, in the presence of scrutineers, to take the ballot boxes and voting material to bed patients, thus enabling such patients to record ordinary or absent <span class="highlight">votes</span>.

* As honourable members are well aware, the present electoral system involves intolerable delays in finalising the election results, particularly when a large number of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> is admitted to the scrutiny as was the case in the 1974 House of Representatives elections when almost 5 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded throughout Australia were postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>.

* Ultimately we may see at a vital time in the Senate a majority changed by <span class="highlight">votes</span> brought about by the actions of the Leader of the National Country Party in this place and the Leader of the National Country Party in Queensland, and a docile Liberal Party leadership which will not stand up and be counted on a great moral and democratic issue such as this.

* The impact of this philosophy in political terms can be judged from the experience of Winnett Boyd in Canada when in 1972 he stood as a Conservative Party candidate and increased the vote of the Conservative Party in the constituency from 15 458 to 37 181- reducing the Liberal majority of the Government of Pierre Trudeau by approximately 20 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to only 1847.

* If one compares the percentages of <span class="highlight">votes</span> that are cast for the Australian Labor Party with the percentages of Labor Party candidates who are elected one will find that the percentages are pretty close.

* I just want to touch on one argument which seems to keep reappearing, though strangely not in the Minister's second reading speech on this occasion, namely the argument that the optional preferential voting system will be greatly beneficial because <span class="highlight">votes</span> will be counted more quickly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1)

* We do not want to cut off certain <span class="highlight">votes</span> and, as is proposed in later Bills, place other restrictions on the rights of people simply because it helps the Labor Party which argues that under such a system the result could be known by midnight of the day of counting.

* If honourable members want an accurate determination of the effect of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> on a large number of candidates and of the difference that the optional preferential system will make, it can be found in the figures for the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1974. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1)

* It is possible under that system for a candidate who obtains a minority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>- that is, 40 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast or even 35 per cent of those <span class="highlight">votes</span>- to be elected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1)

* The legislation now before this House proposing an optional preferential system embodies a provision that requires that a successful candidate must have 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the stage of counting when the result for each seat is declared.

* But if we look at the high percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast in country electorates, we find that the National Country Party, and the Opposition in general, are supporting a system which deprives far more country voters of an expression of choice for a candidate than that system of voting does in respect of city voters.

* I think all honourable members will agree that the aim of any system of voting in single member constituencies should be to ensure that the victorious candidate receives the support of at least 50 per cent of the formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast either by first or subsequent preference. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1)

* Candidate Garland, as I shall call him, receives 41 of those <span class="highlight">votes</span> by way of first preference, candidate Riordan receives 39 and- I will be modest- candidate Howard received only 20 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1)

* The Minister had interjected but he cannot gainsay the fact that if we have an optional preferential system, if we have 3 candidates, and if only half of the number of persons who voted for the third candidate express a preference, it is possible for the victorious candidate to be elected with less than 50 per cent of the primary or subsequent preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the people taking part in the poll. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1)

* It leads to the election of candidates, in single member seats, in respect of whom more than 50 per cent of people have cast adverse <span class="highlight">votes</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1)

* The fact that we get something like six or eight times the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> when we have a large number of candiates as in the last Senate election in New South Wales as against the last House of Representatives election in New South Wales, apparently fades away into insignificance as far as the Opposition is concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0)

* I accuse the Government of humbug because since this Government came to power it has successfully eliminated no fewer than 900 polling places around Australia thus making it more difficult for thousands of people to cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0)

* After all, we do not know until they have stood and the <span class="highlight">votes</span> are gathered whether they are going to be elected, but I believe the Minister is trying to prejudge the matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0)

* As a general rule, under this provision candidates would be required to gain a slightly higher percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> than at present. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0)

* So we say that in matters such as the number of polling booths, the provision of adequate facilities, particularly with regard to postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, and the hours that the booths are open, there is a requirement, a duty, for the Government to provide reasonable convenience to electors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0)

* Speaking of mobile polling booths, the establishment of which this legislation proposes to authorise, the Minister said that they would be: ... a significant step forward in making it easier for the aged and infirm to register their <span class="highlight">votes</span> while at the same time removing the need for canvassers and political parties organisers to invade hospitals, convalescent homes and institutions, as they do at present.

* I hope that every person of overseas origin who is now a voter and who finds a Labor Party member crawling to them for <span class="highlight">votes</span>, as the honourable member for Lalor crawled on 6 September, will know that the Labor Party is phoney through and through on this issue.

* Furthermore, I would recall to honourable gentlemen that the last election for the Senate, the date of which was determined by the Federal Government since it was a double dissolution, more <span class="highlight">votes</span> were received by the Labor candidates than by the candidates of all other parties combined.

* The obvious proposal which comes from the honourable member is that the more voting is facilitated, the more people are able to vote, the easier it becomes to cast a vote, the fewer informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> there are, the more this will assist the Government That may well be true, but it is also true that to facilitate the expression of opinion by electors is basic to the democratic concept.

* We have heard in several debates that the Government wishes to facilitate the voting by people at election time, yet so many of its proposals are to restrict it in terms of time or postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> generally- we will come to that matter when we deal with the next Bill- and in terms of that clause which we last debated providing some people who are living overseas with the right to vote.

* Of course with the Post Office as it is- I do not want to be too rude about its operations but it is common knowledge that some of its transportation of <span class="highlight">votes</span> is a bit slow- and with the understandable congestion in an electoral office whilst an election is being conducted, I suppose it is not possible to process all of these applications and to sent out ballot papers the very next day.
