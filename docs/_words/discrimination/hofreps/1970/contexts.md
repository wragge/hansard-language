* What we really need is education - to educate the public to resent and to turn their backs on <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and to reject <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> not because they fear penalties for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but because of a deep sense of the injustice which is entailed in <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>.

* The objective we all desire- that of overcoming the radical prejudices and discriminations that characterise an uncultured society- must be sought as strenuously through the avenues of education and understanding on a broad general level as it is sought in post-event cases where <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has actually taken place and the courts have become involved.

* Again, in relation to unintentional <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, it could well be that this style of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is brought about by little more than a lack of understanding and awareness.

* In the main, whilst many migrants will be able to complain of individual instances of prejudice or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that they personally have experienced, Australia has developed with their help and effort, largely free from significant racial or cultural prejudice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* There can be no doubt that much remains to be done before we can all claim that for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike equality of opportunity exists, the prejudice and suspicion have been eliminated and that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> no longer exists in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0)

* We must, however, remain cognisant of the need to avoid appearing to be encroaching upon the freedom of individuals, of the distinction between unintentional and wilful <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and of the need to ensure that the proposed conciliation procedures do not become an opportunity for persecution or character assassination.

* I reiterate that much can be gained by the passage of this Bill, bearing in mind the necessary modifications that we of the Opposition will outline, not only by Australia as a nation showing itself to be mature enough to tackle the problems of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but also by each individual who has for so long been disadvantaged by the sad deficiencies in our present system.

* I do not know whether I can convince them that they are wrong but I genuinely believe that legislation used with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, not used with the mailed fist, can be the framework for the next great push in Australia to eliminate racism and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>.

* There is a difference of opinion in this House on this legislation but it is not a difference of opinion regarding the abhorrence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; it is rather a difference of opinion as to the best method by which the problem of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in our society can be handled.

* I know that there will be some on the Government side who will immediately say that the Opposition is speaking with 2 voices, that on the one hand we say that we are against racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but on the other hand we want so to emasculate the Bill that it will not be possible for any effective steps to be taken against the incidence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in our society.

* In our society there is a very strong body of opinion- it was given eloquent expression by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)that  we will not lessen the incidence of racial tension and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by passing fairly stringent laws about it.

* One of the great difficulties about this legislation, because it is to have Australia-wide application, is that while there are serious problems in certain areas of Australia there are large areas of Australia where legislation in the form proposed by the Government could be quite inappropriate, for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  and others, particularly as it is a first go at some kind of legislative proscription of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>.

* Let me hasten to say here and now that the whole idea behind this Bill- the prevention of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- must be supported, but the manner in which these clauses have been drafted and the hidden meaning that appears to me to be behind them could spell disaster for many an innocent citizen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* It is certainly the declared policy of the Opposition parties that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on that basis shall be unlawful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I know the argument that an act of inciting racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is in some respects more despicable than individual acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, because the presence of intent by a person who incites an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> can hardly be called in to question whereas the intent of a person who commits an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- certainly some of the acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as they are prescribed in the language of this legislation- may not be quite the same malicious intent as that of the person who incites. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* But, that notwithstanding, the Opposition feels that the penalty or the consequences for inciting an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> ought still to be civil matters and that they ought to follow the pattern which the Opposition has endeavoured to establish with its other amendments to the procedures to follow complaints of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I recognise that there are arguments to the contrary and that where there is a mixture of reasons some might argue that it is sufficient that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> be a substantial reason. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* But the Opposition believes that it should be the dominant reason for the doing of the act so that in all the circumstances it is fair to say that the reason why a person acted in a particular way was on the ground of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I think that quite deservedly it will catch a lot of people but it will also catch some people who have unwittingly committed acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* We therefore think it is necessary in all the circumstances that there be no doubt that the reason why a person has done an act complained of is by reason of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>.

* While I admit that the question of race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is something in the hearts and minds of people, and it will not be resolved by law, the fact is that in this country the law is not only an expression as outlined in legislation but also it has to have the look of force or the effect of governmental power behind it before most people will take it seriously. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* When one seeks to enact a law for the whole of Australia one has to realise that there are different parts of Australia- different in the sense that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> might be found to be more extensive in some parts than in others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* I think one of the Opposition speakers mentioned that in Australia generally racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, where it occurred, was often inadvertent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* The amendment provides that a person who is unhappy with the conciliation process, a person who complains that he or she has been a victim of an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and feels that nothing has been achieved can go to a civil court and commence proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for any of the remedies which are set out in clause 26. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* Again, the Opposition very sincerely asks the Government to consider the sort of procedure we have in mind, which admittedly is a softer approach to the treatment of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> than that desired by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* On the one hand, there is the demand to eliminate acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* The Opposition accepts that any acts which incite racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> ought to be made unlawful, and in fact the earlier sections of this Bill do make that sort of behaviour unlawful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* Once again, this was part of the pattern of amendments put down by the Opposition which believes that acts inciting racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> should attract the same types of consequences as those acts themselves. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32)

* The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connection with the construction and maintenance of its railways.

* Leaving that aside, I state that we have all accepted in this House the fact that we need positive programs of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of the Aboriginal and Island people to overcome the disabilities from which they suffer in order that perhaps a generation from now all people in this country may be equal. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

* The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

* Again, we swing back to features of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill which would necessitate that if one of these Aborigines from a reserve or, to a lesser extent, one of these Torres Strait Islanders who ethnically seem to demonstrate an all-round greater ability in their original state should apply for a position in this outside world and find that because of lack of opportunity he is not up to the job and preference is given to a non-Aboriginal, immediately, under the terms of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill, an employer who decides to exercise that preference is liable because of all the reasons advanced for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the appointment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

* Let us accept that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and that much of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> directed against the Aboriginal race is most unfortunate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

* In particular, I would like it to try to get at one of the main root causes of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which unfortunately in some areas of Australia today is getting greater and not less. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

* So we are here tonight to remove the discriminatory provisions that remain in the Queensland legislation, and to make provisions with respect to the people of the Aboriginal race of Australia and the race to which the Torres Strait Islanders belong for the purpose of preventing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in certain respects against those peoples under the laws of Queensland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0)

* It is not only in this area of workers' compensation that this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Western Australia appears but also under social services benefits legislation in relation to fees payable to a chiropractor and fees payable to a chiropractor under the repatriation services legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0)
