* As it is International Women's Year, I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to various incidents which show how diligent a government must be and how difficult it is, until one actually has legislation to enforce an idea, to bring people to realise that they have a blind spot and that when it comes to matters such as <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between the sexes, unfortunately, a deal of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> still exists.

* It is recognised by the Opposition that if we are to cope with racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in a way that seeks to specify what are acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and to indicate a community disapproval of such conduct, then provisions of the character which are contained in the Bill are desirable.

* If it be said that one reason why civil proceedings are not the appropriate proceedings under the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act is because of the delicacy of the human relations which are involved, one might draw by way of comparison the fact that that has been the type of argument which has been used to justify certain types of proceedings before conciliation commissioners.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* What the Government is doing is relying upon the fact that there is an international convention for the elimination of all forms of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which Australia is ratifying and which, because of the obligations which it is said flow from that ratification, enables it to exercise its powers to make laws with respect to external affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0)

* It may be that that will be a consequence of the Bill, but whether that will aid in the elimination of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is very much open to question, because the more there is a concentration and a focusing of attention on an issue which to many people has never been an issue at all, the more it will create problems which never before were problems.

* On the other hand, although it appears that the Act has had beneficial effects in the fields of unemployment and housing the board considers that there is still evidence of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, especially in promotion opportunities and the 'white collar' sector of employment and in private housing.

* Although the level of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> seems, therefore, to be lower now than it was before the Act, the general conclusion from these findings must be that the number of cases of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that are dealt with by the law (either by means of conciliation or by means of legal sanctions) forms a very small proportion of the number of acts of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that actually occur.

* To my mind the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill 1975 that is before us is, in its present form, in many aspects of the over-government type and is restrictive of the freedom of Australian citizens to express their opinions freely and to conduct their own affairs in accordance with the dictates of their consciences.

* I have had some experience of matters which have been drawn to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  over the past year or two in which, in my judgment as a lawyer who has had some practise in this field, it would be difficult to obtain solutions simply by going to the courts because quite often people who are the subject of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> are the sort of people who are least able to take advantage of court procedures.

* In my view, the important thing is that the people of Australia should see that a Bill comes out of this Parliament that has the unanimous support of the Parliament, because I think that that in itself will be a big propaganda victoryand I use the word 'propaganda' in a nonoffensive sense, I hope- for those people who believe that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> should be destroyed in Australia.

* After all, as I said earlier, it is comparatively easy to lay down legislative processes that would seek to eliminate racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but when you come to implementing them in human terms I ask the question: How do we really do it, do it effectively, and how do we do it so that the total society benefits and so that relations between persons and person, group and group, and community and community are maintained for the benefit and total development of the whole?

* In the outline of the allegations and in the observations it has been presented to me as a member of the Senate Committee that there was a section of our Australian community that was suffering some disadvantage that it should not have suffered; that there was a section of our Australian community that felt that it was being discriminated against and was offended or hurt as a result of this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which it believed it was not entitled to receive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* I think it also should be mentioned that there is a growing number of people within our Australian community- there is a growing number of communities within Australiawho are seriously concerned, as have been speakers in this debate, about racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in Australia and who through the various opportunities available to them are doing constructive work to combat <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>.

* I am a little reluctant but I do mention that it is a matter of regret and indeed grief to some groups within our society that the Baltic community in Australia still has a very strong feeling that it has been the victim of some <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, so that when we undertake legislation here, whether it be the Government or the whole Senate, in connection with the matter of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, I think we have to be aware of the complexities that exist and aware of the fact that even the most finely developed legislation cannot solve all of the human and the personal problems in racial matters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0)

* That is not correct since the selection criteria, the variations in the selection criteria and the ability to expand this scheme and the various schemes of reciprocal scholarships will in fact mean that the emphasis will be upon the selection of people of merit rather than the selection procedures which have been highly discriminatory in countries of origin in the past, as one can see from the practices involving the Malaysian Government in the way in which it has practised quite a considerable form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against students it trains in its own universities, and in the racial composition of that group of students who study overseas.

* Perhaps the most succinct editorial comment on the legislation, taking into account both the Human Rights Commission Bill and the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill however came from the  Canberra Times  on 29 September, when the following statement was made: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* One interesting and important clause in the Bill is clause 9 (2) which recognises the necessity, in certain circumstances, for affirmative action or benign <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; the clause in question provides that an enactment or practice should not be regarded as offensive to human rights if it is:  . [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* It is true that in a number of areas like racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and also the protection of privacy effective investigative and conciliatory machinery can be as important in practice and perhaps even more important than the creation of formal rights enforceable through the courts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Of course the Bill does not give specific legislative approval to the ratification of the Covenant as did by way of contrast the Radial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1975 in relation to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Let me now turn to the other side of the coin, the other piece of legislation, the companion piece of legislation that has been introduced, the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* He started with a piece of legislation which had been emasculated by the Liberal and National Country Parties in this Senate by removing from it provisions or rewriting provisions so as to make the proof of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> more difficult, so as to remove from the Commissioner his power of compulsory evidence gathering, by removing from the Commission his power to initiate litigation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Against that background, let us look and see what the Government is trying to do to the Community Relations Commission in this Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The second criticism that the Opposition has about this legislation is that the various functions which are vested in the Community Relations Commissioner by section 20 of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act, namely investigation and settlement of complaints, promotion of compliance with the Act and general research and education to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, are now all given specifically to the new Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* Thirdly, although it appears on the face of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill that there is nothing in it to directly stop complaints of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> wherever arising, including Queensland, being channeled directly to  Mr Grassby,  as they have been in the past, the Opposition believes that one must take into account the potential effect of clause 1 1 (1) (b) of the Human Rights Commission Bill, which has an effect, and which would make it possible for the Commonwealth to delegate completely to a State any function relating to the promotion of the observance of human rights, 'including functions of the Commission'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* One cannot forbear from commenting that continued pressure of the kind that has so far been so successfully exerted in the past, for example, in relation to Aurukun and Mornington Island, may well result in the Commonwealth handing back to States like Queensland the domestic enforcement of all or part of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* The fourth general matter that I wish to raise about the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill is that  Mr Grassby  's staff is to be transferred lock, stock and barrel to the new Commission, leaving him no powers at all of hiring, firing or deployment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0)

* I am not suggesting that Australia is any different from any other country, because I think what we have witnessed in recent times is this tremendous world movement towards human rights and against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, and the struggle of the Third World countries to be recognised in the same way as other countries, the realisation that the superpowers should not have the sort of powers that they have to make decisions over life and death, peace and war.

* I believe the merit of  Senator Missen  's proposal, which is in similar terms to the proposal put forward by the Labor Party and endorsed by the Australian Democrats, is that it may, along with the similar clauses in the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act and the proposed similar clause in former  Senator Murphy's  Bill on Human rights, build up a practice whereby this Parliament is involved in the process of telling the international community that we will be bound in some particular manner.

* As I said, this proposal to amend the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act is designed simply to rationalise the machinery so that, when the proposed Commonwealth institution, which will have an overriding position in relation to human rights, is established, it will have that power in relation to the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act and in relation to other specific Acts in that area which might be passed by the Parliament.

* The effect of that is that one member of the Commission, which is to consist of a  chairman,  a  deputy chairman  and not less than five nor more than nine other members, would already have been already identified as the person who holds the rank and office, under the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act, of Commissioner for Community Relations.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It is a matter for great regret that the vote to reject the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill was lost last night only by one vote, as a result of the indavertent non-appearance in the chamber, in time, of  Senator Harradine. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It is obvious that a consideration of this kind is at best a barely veiled rationalisation of the Government's real reason; that is, it finds  Mr Grassby,  the present Commissioner, a political embarrassment not because of his previous party affiliations but because of the way he so relentlessly exposed the deficiency of governmental activity both at the State and Federal levels in protecting our citizens against racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>.

* As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, it is no accident that in the corridors of this Parliament back bench Liberal members are referring to the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill as the Get Grassby Bill', because that is what it is about.

* It has sought to pretend and claim to the community at large that nothing is changing, that something is being added to the present structure for the protection of human rights, but that nothing is being taken away and that it is business as usual as far as the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act and  Mr Grassby  are concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* It seems ludicrous to me that we are setting up the Human Rights Commission and that part and parcel of that Commission will be the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act under which the person holding the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations is to work. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* I am giving my total support to this amendment because I believe it is necessary, if we are to have Human Rights Commission and if we are to maintain the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act and the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations, that the Commissioner have a vital role to play on that Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64)

* However, if somebody else were to be appointed to that position, I must say that I think that person, if he were a person of great integrity and great capacity, probably would want to think twice about taking a position which potentially was of such subservience as these Bills, the Human Rights Commission Bill and the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Amendment Bill, would reduce it to.

* I believe that the support given to it in its eventual form by distinguished former Liberal senators, such as the late Ivor Greenwood, and the way in which he linked the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act with the first statutory reference to the International Covenant, indicate the seriousness with which honourable senators on this side of the Parliament have regarded the problems of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>.

* I direct the attention of honourable senators to those criticisms- the criticism that the Commissioner is placed under the control of the Human Rights Commission, that complaints will not be as easily handled by the Commissioner in the future, that he will be subject to directions that his access to staff will be reduced, that his report to Parliament will disappear and that his role in promoting an understanding and a public awareness of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> matters will also disappear.

* I think it is fair to say that if the Government was considering these questions afresh and was entirely able to develop its own blueprint for a Human Rights Commission and a human rights approach, it would be doubtful whether it would actually create a statutory position of a commissioner of human relations as has been created by the Labor Government under the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act.
