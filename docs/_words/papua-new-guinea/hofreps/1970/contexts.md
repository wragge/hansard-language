[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0)

* However, of much greater importance is the fact that the Opposition's policy has been rejected by the people's representatives in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly, and it cannot be said that the members of that House acted hastily, without long and deep consideration of the issues or without evidence of all shades and intensity of feeling in the country.

* Nor can it be said that the House of Assembly was talked or pressured by the Australian Administration into its findings, for the plain fact of the matter is that the House of Assembly, of its own initiative, set up the Select Committee on Constitutional Development, which travelled widely in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, visiting other developing societies and hearing a great deal of evidence.

* The extent of the distress which Labor policy has created is measured by a motion which passed through the House of Assembly by  36  votes to  11  and which stated that, if Labor won the next election in Australia and attempted to impose selfgovernment on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> without the consent of a majority of the people, the next House of Assembly should petition the United Nations to direct the Australian Government to act in accordance with the freely expressed will and desire of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as guaranteed by the United Nations declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, and by the policy of the present Australian Government.

* There are those areas in which I think we have done quite well, but on the whole I believe that our good work has been bedevilled by an undue caution, by a failure to trust the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> adequately and by a failure to develop an effective Public Service.

* I welcome the statement by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  most sincerely for not only does it point out very clearly the outline of the future development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but it also demonstrates for all of us to see the difference in approach between this Government and members of the Opposition.

* The Leader of the Opposition has undertaken two quick trips to New Guinea over the past couple of years and in each case he has told those who attended the meetings that were held what a Labor Government would do with respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> regardless - I repeat regardless - of what the indigenous people wanted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0)

* On the other hand, the Government has supported the formation of a Select Committee of Constitutional Development with members drawn, not from the ranks of Labor Press secretaries or ex-Australian trade union organisers, but from indigenous and expatriate members of the elected representatives of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; people who live and work in the Territory; people who can speak the lan guage of the Territory and who, presumably, have some knowledge in depth of the customs and mores of the Territorians.

* Surely it must be obvious to even the most obtuse of people that such a committee, with the membership it had, with the work it did, with the meetings it held, with the views it heard, would be in a better position to speak for the majority of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> than would a raiding party of Australian Labor Party theoreticians as exemplified by the recent visits to the Territory of the Leader of the Opposition and his minions.

* So just let us qualify a little this apparently universal capacity of Papua New Guineans to run their own show in the face of international overtures, competition and international desire for investment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* Who would wish on the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with a couple of million people, having a substantial problem with large areas of land differentially occupied in terms of population density and even in land use, a 3-tier system of government which half the speeches in this House deal with as being a major problem of national operation? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* I think there should be very great circumspection exercised in any possibility or contemplation in a serious vein of introducing a formalised and to that extent, once implemented, a relatively inflexible third or middle tier of government in so young a territory as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* It seems to me that one of the major problems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that not enough of the leadership in the House of Assembly or in the local government councils has made a conscious, intelligent commitment to create national unity. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* The most disturbing thing about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that there does not appear to have been among enough leaders - if among any leaders - a conscious decision that the goal of their life is to create a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* It is probable that there are not many more than 100,000 in what we could call a wage or salary sector of the economy in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, even throwing in plantation labour, and in a large population of 2.5 million there are very many more people who are living in a traditionalsubsistence economy and who are not affected by the level of wages. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* We have been extremely fortunate in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that although these places have developed there as badly as in almost anywhere else in the Pacific, the people who have come to dwell in shanty towns have come in tribal units and the tribe can sit with a pretty severe discipline on the young people of the group which has moved in. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* There has been somebody in the shanty towns responsible for the behaviour of younger people and there has not been to the same extent as there has been in other areas of the Pacific the breakdown of tribal disciplinary sanctions among shanty dwellers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* I was alarmed to get correspondence from missionaries in the Bougainville area whom I respect speaking about the position of migrant workers who have been taken from other parts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to work for construction companies which have been carrying out construction ancilliary to the development of the mining areas there. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* It is pretty well known in this House that people who originally said many years ago - and did not say it as a Black Power slogan either, but as a genuine conviction - 'black is beautiful', are the people of Buka and Bougainville, who are the blackest people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and have the habit of calling the browner people of other areas 'red men'.

* Unfortunately the extent and depth of educational services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are as yet insufficient to meet the potential demand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* Prior to the Second World War the great bulk of educational opportunity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was provided by voluntary mission schools and was essentially limited to primary schooling. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* Alan Randall's 'Reorganisation of Education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>' covers this quite clearly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* The second is to ensure that the dual system which we have adopted, which we cherish and which we have fought for in our own country is offered to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* One of the great problems of education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is simply to get education to the people. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* What the honourable member wants - I think that I am right in my interpretation of what he had to say - is to ensure that the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have a freedom of choice, that is, that they can send their children either to a State school or to a non-State school. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* Personally,  1  thought that the achievement of uniformity, if we can call it that, between the  2  systems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was an achievement of some magnitude and that the living together of church schools and Administration schools or State schools - call them what we will - was an achievement of great social importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* But the important thing about education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that there are so many people who still are getting none at all. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* What I wish to say first of all is that I hope that all Australians are starting to realise how important is our work in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* So, we are creating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, if this is the term which we should apply to this social and political exercise in which we are engaged, a nation of some international significance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* It is important that in all our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> we realise that this is the case, and that every step that we take which produces negative results can be fraught with danger and difficulty for the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* As I understand it - and the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  will correct me if I am wrong - earlier in the year a resolution was passed by the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> asking for a committee of this Parliament to visit Papua, I think it was, to have discussions on the grounds - let me put it that way - of some of the problems associated with it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* In the long run we will not be able to treat the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> differently from the people of New Zealand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* The people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the British Solomons, Tonga and all the rest - all the people associated with the South Pacific Commission, for instance - are people with whom we have to find a new relationship. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* While there are 2 million people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the population in other places is relatively small - 100,000 here, 20,000 somewhere else. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* That is why I am disappointed that our relationship as a Parliament with the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been so peripheral. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32)

* One of the problems, as I see it, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> stems from the tremendous difficulties created by geography, by lack of communications and by the incapacity of people to operate an administrative system because they are not literate in the language of the Administration, and so on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0)

* Therefore, I hope that we will not inflict upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> certain attitudes just because we have developed those attitudes or just because, back in the early 1950s, a former Prime Minister said: 'We will have 2 groups, the Cabinet and the Ministry'.

* It is interesting that the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  has dropped his previous opposition earlier this year to the regional members, although in making that criticism, I believe he is being completely consistent because if one turns to the debates on the establishment of the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1963 one finds that the honourable member and his Party were opposed to the reserve electorates and wanted a proliferation of the open electorates which then numbered forty-four.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0)

* I do not think that you,  Mr Speaker,  would allow me to range as widely over related matters in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as did the honourable member for Fremantle who has a great deal of experience in this matter and, if I might say so, left me lamenting, apart from his amendment, on exactly where we were supposed to go.

* One would not think the whole modus operandi, not to mention the modus vivendi, of the relationship between Australia and its trust Territory would give rise to anything approaching an inclination to dictatorship in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; but I suppose it is wise to take account of any possible contingency.

* On the contrary, the Government's policy is one of promoting an integrated Australian society looking towards political and racial equality for all, of supporting selfdetermination on the basis of majority rule, say for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and of co-operating with the United Nations towards that end.

* The proceeds of the loan are for relending by the Administration to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank, and will meet the foreign currency component of a number of development projects financed by that Bank in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the next 3 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Opposition supports the measure, particularly because the loan is in what are described as soft loan terms rather than hard; that is, the money is to be available to the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at a rate of only 3 per cent, which is very low by today's standards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* I pointed out then the difficulty of a relatively undeveloped country such as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> being able to finance development when there was an interest component of somewhere in excess of 7 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* The Minister, in introducing the measure, said that the loan is the first that the Asian Development Bank has made to the Administration since the admission of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to membership of the Asian Development Bank in April 1971. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* That merely serves to indicate that as recently as September 1966 there seemed to be no indication that what might be called self-government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was likely in the foreseeable future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* It was a comparatively long process before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> became a separate member and, therefore, it is not surprising that this should be the first loan when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been so recently a member of the Bank. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* However, I would like to say one or two things about the potential for development and what appears to be the relatively slow rate of economic development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the fact that to some extent the economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> seems to be becoming afflicted with some of the problems flowing from Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* Among other things it points to a comparatively rapid rate of inflation occurring in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which in that year was running at something like 12 per cent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* It is still an economy that is basically a subsistence economy although it runs the great danger of becoming what is sometimes described as a dual or triple economy, where there is a kind of European expatriate superstructure through which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would tend to get somewhere in the middle a semi-industrial development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* The bulletin does contain estimates of the national income for the whole economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to some extent they typify what I have been trying to describe. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* What we describe as the gross national product at factor cost in the case of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is $545m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* However, what is described as the subsistence sector, although it is the income for something over 95 per cent of the total population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, is only about onethird of the sum I have quoted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* This raises some very difficult problems for the future development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* The other problem that faces <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is the large imbalance in trade. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* As with the Australian adverse balance of trade, to some extent that is offset by the inflow of foreign capital, but a large part of the foreign capital which flows into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> comes from Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* We know that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is striving for something that is described as self government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* But when, as the statistics show, well over half of what is described as government revenue in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> does not come from taxes raised in the Territory but comes from the Treasury in Australia, in some respects self government has a peculiar meaning. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* One of the difficulties that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> faces with its exports is that for a considerable period of time it will have to rely for export income on such commodities as cocoa, coffee and tea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* A Reserve Bank bulletin which I have provides some interesting information about both the world cocoa scene and the situation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in particular. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* Most of what <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is likely to produce in the future falls within the category of tropical products. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* Nevertheless it seems sometimes that in Australia, at least in our attitude to New Guinea, we tend to fall into the error of thinking that the greatest assistance we can give to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is in building up its industries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* Again the Reserve Bank statistics indicate some quite serious dislocations that have taken place in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> economy by reason of the rather rapid acceleration of the Bougainville development and subsequently the rapid decline in that development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* But I hope that the Australian Government wil not withdraw any of the succour that it gives to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because, like the authors of the publication which I have just read, it may not like the Pangu Pati as the government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* From what was said on today's news I understand that a Pangu dominated combination has finally emerged as the government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that it is to be sworn in today.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* I submit that the same kind of thing applies as far as Australia is concerned, that we cannot be concerned only with our own internal growth in the next 10 or 15 years without paying some consideration also to what the growth of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is going to be in the years ahead.

* The function of this loan is to be, we would imagine, substantially along the same channels as those already used for the allocation of loan moneys from other sources, particularly from this country, for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank to use as it would. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* Since the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank in 1967 to the end of June 1971, the Bank had received capita] allocations of over $13m from the Administration's budget.

* I would like to incorporate in Hansard Table 1 from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank Annual Report and Financial Statements for 1970-71, which indicates the total approvals of loans by the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank and shows the break-up of those loans for the last 2 years to that time.

* During 1970-71 there were 498 commercial loans for about $750,000 made to Papua New Guineans compared with less than half that number in the previous year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* Unless I am mistaken, the loan from the Asian Development Bank to the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank, and hence to the enterprises and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, will be a further movement in the right direction, in that it provides more moneys for further and, we hope, controlled and sensible directional development in the case of this Territory for which we have, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports rightly pointed out, so much responsibility which is not going to diminish totally for a little time yet.

* In the same year the production of cocoa in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was estimated to be 29,000 tons, which represented a significant increase in its production over the previous year - an increase of some 7,000 tons. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0)

* I think the significant factor is that the price of cocoa fell quite markedly which meant that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had to market more cocoa to receive virtually the same amount of money as export income.

* I assure the House that the Government, for its part, has a great interest in these matters, as is shown by its activity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and by the very substantial sums which have been given to help to develop that country - a matter which I believe in general has the support of the whole of this Parliament and of the Australian people.

* It is woath while reminding the House that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> stands as a member of the Asian Development Bank in its own right, although at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> being accepted as a member, Australia agreed to stand behind <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s obligations until such time as it was able to take over these responsibilities for itself.

* Although this type of legislation sounds as though it is concerned only with international finance and capital markets, in reality and in practical terms the increased bank lending which it will permit will, among other things, facilitate loans to personal and small scale enterprises by the indigenous population - not only in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through its own Development Bank, but also in many other Asian countries.

* Nevertheless when we take into account that we have a Budget provision of over Si 0,000m this year and that the provision for multilateral bilateral aid and assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a separate amount comes to only $220m we can appreciate that this amount really is not very adequate when put against the projected defence expenditure of SI, 300m and the talk of a 5-year programme for defence.

* The watershed in Australia's relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will come at independence and not at self government, whether it be de jure or, indeed, de facto, because we have responsibilities to the United Nations.

* Having put that to the honourable member I say that it has been a view consistently stated by me that in regard to any functions prior to the attainment of self government and in regard to all functions still held by the Australian Government prior to the attainment of independence, I would seek the opinion of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before exercising the power that was still residing with me.

* Therefore, in important areas such as the fields of defence and police, where <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself is contributing the overwhelming majority of personnel in both areas, it is of the utmost importance that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be involved in any decisions made in relation to them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0)

* We believe, therefore, that where there is government action and ' where ' we are consciously handing over to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a Commonwealth Government equity in any <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> enterprise, and especially where we ourselves have had a  50  per cent holding as a government in relation to the private sector of a company, the indigenous equity should not be less. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0)

* I think it is quite important that we, in our relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, should give the example when we are setting up a company, such as the one set out in the Bill, of ensuring that they have a decisive equity in that company because if they are to go into partnership with businessmen as astute as some of those operating around the world at the present time they may find that they will run into very serious trouble within a very few years of their independence.

* In conclusion, referring to the point about Japanese investment, I think we have to face the fact that as the pace of development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> quickens and the search for export markets widens, we must expect a corresponding diversification in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s sources of supply.

* I think this is a tribute to the far-sighted, statesmanlike policies of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  following upon his very much publicised, and at the time criticised, visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> 21 years ago. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* 1 also think that if the present Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  had been Prime Minister any earlier we may not have reached the situation in which we are today, because I think that the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  was probably pushed by the Leader of the Opposition into coming out in favour- of early selfgovernment and independence - for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* I think this matter is of paramount importance because <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is our closest neighbour, because shortly, as I have said, it will achieve self-government and independence, because that independent country may have to face enormous economic and political problems and last but not least, because there are many Australian nationals who will be involved in any changeover that takes place. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I appreciate that many of these questions must be dealt with very carefully but our military relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must be squarely faced and on this subject we cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand.

* In the short time left to me I would like to say that I think a very much greater commitment for civil aid to be given to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence should be stated by the Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I am sure that much of the opposition to independence within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has sprung from a fear amongst the people of that country that if it is given independence Australia will up stumps and leave Papua [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* 8 presented by the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  on 15th August shows a proposed expenditure of $220m in 1972-73 on official economic aid to developing countries, including $145m for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* With the exception of a loan in ,<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> our aid has been given, as grant aid with no strings 'attached. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* In 1972-73, in addition to further .financial assistance for the building of the defence forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Government proposes to spend approximately $14m on defence aid to certain developing countries in South East Asia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I think that if the Minister were fair, and if this were not an election year he in turn would pay tribute to the Leader of the Opposition for the wonderful job he did in January 1970 when he visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Let me make it clear to the Committee that at the moment about $2Sm of the Australian taxpayers' money is being spent on the defence resources in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I am not going to pass judgment on whether this is a correct sum and I am not going to pass judgment on how this money is being spent in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> other than to say that it is my belief that it should be spent through the Department of External Territories and not directly through an appropriation to the Department of the Army. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* 1 do not entirely accept this argument, because I believe that we could very well delegate our responsibilities for defence and, indeed, to an extent for foreign affairs, to the Administrator in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  His  Honour  Mr Les  Johnson. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* In my view it would be a great improvement if we went one stage further and delegated these powers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and appropriated this $25m through the estimates for tha Department of External Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* J feel it would then be clearer that it would be the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government itself -  Mr Michael  Somare and his Cabinet - which would decide whether this money should be spent on defence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* But the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may prefer to spend some of it in another way, or it may consider that it needs more defence and spend more of the appropriation going through the Department of External Territories on defence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Recently  Mr Michael  Somare said that he believed that there should not be more than 3,000 expatriates, or Australians, working in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration, if I understood him correctly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I believe that we have made a mistake in foisting on to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a similarly sophisticated Public Service establishment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I believe that the first step has now been taken to see that the Public Service establishment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not so sophisticated or expensive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* He talked about the situation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and brought to our attention some of the very real changes which will occur in this area of our immediate environment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* We did exactly the same thing in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Along with everybody on this side of the House who has shown a keen interest in the development and the sane progress of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the announcements made tonight, I think I must agree that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have to look more towards the South Pacific area than they have as yet done, because the South Pacific area is part of an area in which the political and constitutional change is dynamic. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I hope that our relationships with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will not come into the scope of foreign relations and that we will not create a barrier between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia which is based upon the view of one or the other is a foreigner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* It is very important that this matter be given serious consideration and that we do not build up an elite in the Pacific Islands Regiment to the detriment of other areas of activity in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* The increase in aid in this budgetary year to $220m, including the major portion that goes to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, is one of the more commendable developments in our budgeting this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* In the remaining few minutes of my speech I would like to touch on the question of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which is related to the foreign affairs area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I think that our good will, our interest and our money will be needed for as long as we possibly can expend them in that quarter, because the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> face problems which are, I think, a good deal more serious than the would-be urban crises which are developed by our friends from the Australian Labor Party in respect to Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* There are considerable fears in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the ultimate division in the country may be one of highlanders versus lowlanders [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I think it will be a great pity if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s ultimate selfgovernment is prejudiced by the inability to carry out what the honourable member for St George  (Mr Morrison)  and others were talking about in relation to other places - that is, the minimising of the gap between the haves and the have nots, or at least the haves and those who have less. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* The stimulus in regard to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> came from a visit to that country by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in January  1970. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Having said that, I would like to point out that there are one or two areas where I believe there are distinct differences between the attitudes of the Government and the attitudes of the Opposition in regard to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Another is the na?r of appropriating $40m, which at the moment goes directly from Austraia  to  <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under, I believe, the estimates of the Prime Minister's Department or maybe some other department rather than through the Department of External Territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* This amount is being spent on the extra salaries of Australians working in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I want to add to those  2  areas of difference by pointing out that I hope that an Australian Labor Party government will give the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - the Administrator's Executive Council as the Cabinet of that country is known now  -  n:n idea of what the long term financial commitments of this country will be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* lt has been of great interest to me personally to go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and find there a department of economic planning such as we on this side of the Parliament think we ought to have in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I am referring to the Office of Programming and Co-ordination, which is one of the departments of government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, The Office of Programming and Co-ordination was not brought to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because of some clear thinking on the part of Australian politicians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I believe it was brought to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because of the advice  of  the World Bank and the United Nations which, of course, have taken such an interest in that part of the world. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* That Office of Programming and Coordination, so far as I can see, is working with one arm tied behind its back, because one of the main sources of funds for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is the appropriation by this Parliament. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I hope that if by some sad mischance the Australian Labor Party is not governing in Australia over the next year the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is at the table will have an influence on the incoming government and will see to it that a longer term commitment is made to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> rather than the present ad hoc year to year commitment. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* We ail realise that a tremendous amount of the aid from Australia does go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* The point I want to make arising from that is that it will be good for this country when we do not have to put so much of our aid into one basket, namely, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> basket, and can spread more of it around to others of our neighbours. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I believe that we may be able to do this in the not too distant future because of the extra income that will accrue to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the Bougainville project. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* These are part of the calculations which would be made when we in Australia decide on some formula in relation to what amount we will appropriate to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the long term. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Perhaps the formula should be such a one that we will make up what is required in order to maintain a 10 ner cent increase in the gross national income cf <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* Perhaps we could appropriate $X and allow for an increase of perhaps 10 per cent to take account of the decline in the value of money, so that  Mr Michael  Somare, the Chief Minister, and his Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will know what they can expect from this country and plan accordingly, using this Office of Programming and Co-ordination. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36)

* I would mention that at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s admission to the Asian Development Bank Australia gave an undertaking to the Bank in accordance with Article 3.3 of the agreement establishing the Bank that, until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself assumes responsibility for its own international relations, Australia would be responsible for all obligations that may be incurred by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by reason of its admission to membership in the Bank and enjoyment of the benefits of such membership.

* In addition to guaranteeing the repayment of principal and payment of interest and other charges on the loan until such time as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumes responsibility for its own international relations, the letter gives certain other customary assurances required by the Bank.

* Because these assurances go further than the statutory guarantee already provided under section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act it is necessary for specific Commonwealth legislation to be passed in order for the assurances to constitute valid and binding obligations of the Commonwealth as required by the Bank.

* I pause to state a small but important point, namely, that although the definition clause of the Bill defines the administration as the 'Administration or Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>', the speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and his Letter of Assurances contained in Schedule 1 and the Loan Agreement contained in Schedule 2 refers solely to the Administration.

* It is perhaps a minor point but nevertheless while <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has not yet reached the formal stage of self government it is virtually that now, and perhaps it is time at least in Ministers' speeches if not in the legislation, to refer to the government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as just that.

* The Minister referred in his speech to the borrowings carrying an automatic guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-71 but, of course, such a guarantee can never be interpreted as a firm continuing guarantee for the simple reason that the section could be amended at any time, thus occasioning the guarantee to disappear. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* Some of the questions to be answered include the extent to which financial aid should be fully on a project basis or whether, as is the case now, some of it should be devoted to supporting an annual or multi-annual program of expenditure; whether there should continue to be an oversight of project aid; whether <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> projects will continue to have preferential access to the Australian market; and.

* On this matter I assume that the attitude of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would depend on many factors which it would weigh up at the appropriate time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* It goes back some years originally to the missions sent by the International Bank which at that time recommended particularly the building of a road from the coast at Lae up to Goroka to open up the inner highland region which contains about one-half of the population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* The Asian Development Bank, apart from its importance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and apart from' <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s importance to us, has a very direct importance to Australia's interests and participation in the South East Asian area.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* I think this is important because what the previous Administration did under the honourable member for Kooyong, who was a Minister, and what we are doing now is to provide an international identity for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* By the time we come to self-government, which the previous Government decided would be granted on 1st December 1973 and which we fully supported, and before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> gains independence it will in fact have an international identity.

* As all honourable members will understand, particularly those who have been to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it is highly important for the development of the country that access to the very remote areas in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be made easily available.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  during his recent visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> indicated that we will undertake a 3-year program starting in the budget period of 1974-75. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* As <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> approaches self-government and independence it is very necessary that the structuring of the budget - the budgetary practices - in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be changed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* I think this is important because if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to attract aid from other countries, it should have a development budget - in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it is called, in general terms, an improvement budget - so that foreign countries can attach themselves to projects that are thrown up in the improvement program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* We will be looking towards an improvement or development budget and a change in the budgetary systems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and we will be looking towards a definition in the Budget of projects that will open the way for assistance from the developing countries in aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* In essence the question was why the present Australian Government was forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to borrow its loan funds from overseas and limiting Australia's contribution to a 'miserly' $10m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* The point is that the Government is not forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into world loan markets in preference to assistance from the Australian Government, but I think it is important for all honourable members to realise that there are advantages for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in seeking loans from overseas to finance part of its expenditure. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0)

* I should like to place on record, although the term of office of  Mr Leslie  Johnson is not yet completed, the fact that many members of this House and many Australians should be grateful for the role  Mr Johnson  has played as the Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* Because of the regrettable dearth of knowledge of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affairs in Australia many people may not recognise or be cognisant of the contribution that this outstanding man has made to the close relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and to the development of self government in that area. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* 1 am not here just to extend plaudits, but his predecessor, the Secretary of the Departmental of External Territories, and the officers who work in that outstanding Department who have done so much to bring about even the acceptance by the United Nations of Australia's role in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, should have their performance placed on record before that Department is merged with other Commonwealth departments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* The Minister seems to be working extremely closely with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and for this we can be most grateful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* There will be occasions when there will be differences of views between the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* We must recognise as each step is taken that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is becoming an identifiable force in world affairs - a minor one at this stage but an identifiable country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* Although Australia does not look for gratitude for the role it has played in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it looks for close ties with her in the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* But her role as a separate entity in world affairs which is beginning to develop will mean that inevitably she will be looking to problems of her role in Asia, the Pacific and the world through the eyes of Papua New Guineans and not through Australians' eyes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* But I think that there is a tendency for Australians still to think that they must exercise a more overt authority over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> than is realistically necessary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* The Minister said in the earlier part of his statement that he and the Australian Government will work with all due speed toward independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the closest consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the House of Assembly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0)

* The Minister made it clear during the debate on the Bill that the matters referred to were such things as aviation engineering work for outside organisations, the handling of Commonwealth contracts, the establishment and operation of hotels and other kinds of accommodation, the establishment and operation of road transport services, the acquisition of subsidiaries or shareholdings in companies or the establishment of subsidiaries for the purposes of the Australian National Airlines Commission, aerial work and charter operations, and operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0)

* In addition, it provides for the other activities on which there is agreement that TAA should have full powers in such areas as aerial work operations: the operation of hotels and other forms of accommodation; joint operations with other carriers; air transport operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, after that country becomes independent, under arrangements which are agreed between the Commonwealth and the Government of that country; and engineering services for outside organisations. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0)

* 1 was terribly concerned because there was a convention that banned payments of as little as $2.50 a month for plantation workers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0)

* It may or may not be the complete truth that agreements were reached some little time ago with the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to that country's internal airline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0)

* What is patently true now is that the rapidly emerging country of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> wants its own internal airline with the shares in the rough proportion of 52 per cent to be held by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, 24 per cent by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and 12 per cent each by Qantas Airways Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0)

* We have encouraged <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to propound its own ideas and to think for itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Minister for Civil Aviation, who is a funny little man, pokes his nose rather irreverently into the situation and implies that unless <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> gives up its ideas about the capital structure of its own internal airline, he will move to prohibit certain grants in aid to that rapidly emerging country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0)

* The people's airline has been very negligent indeed in opening up <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that is obviously one of the reasons why the Chief Minister of that country wants the expertise and the knowledge of private enterprise to help to continue this motivation of his country's internal airline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0)

* The point I am trying to make, in spite of the interjections from the honourable member for Hunter, is quite clearly that no matter whether we should protect our own airline or not, we do not have the moral right to dictate how <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should set up its own airline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0)

* If there is not a half way position I for one will stand in this House and say that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must now be given encouragement to work out its own salvation, and woe betide anyone who sets himself up as a pseudo imperialist on the one hand while denying the right of capital inflows from other nations on the other hand. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0)

* The Bill seeks approval for a contractual guarantee for overseas borrowing in foreign currencies by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> not exceeding $A14.3m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I wish to refer to matters concerned with the controversy that occurred over the future of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> national airline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I shall relate my remarks to the raising of funds under this loan Bill because they have some significance to the fact that this is the first time that the Australian Government has given a guarantee to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for that country to seek funds overseas other than from the Asian Development Bank or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* We support the contractual guarantee because, as it relates to the first loan that is to be raised in this manner, if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to be favourably recognised as an emerging international entity it is absolutely essential that the first issue be successful. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I said earlier that theloan will be the first raised by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on international capital markets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* But it is, as I inferred, not the first time that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has obtained overseas borrowings. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* In this case the loan will be to finance the public works and services of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* What I want to raise and call into question is that here we have a situation in which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is seeking loans overseas, and it is saying in its prospectus that it will receive a guarantee from the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* But at the same time, as a consequence of statements made by a Minister in this House, the actual security of investments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been called into question and the manner in which the Government has been administering <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has also been called into question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I do not relate my remarks to the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  who, as I said on a previous occasion, appeared to me to be working particularly closely with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I have abstained from making remarks in this Parliament about the statements of the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Mr Charles Jones)  because I believed that it was only right that the matter be cooled and that a fresh and proper approach be taken to the national airline of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* But as this Bill is before the Parliament and as it refers to the opportunities for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to borrow overseas, it is related to the question of the development of an airline and the close association of Australia to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and it is necessary only a few days before the Minister's return to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to register a couple of points. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* [ reject the submission that has been made by the Minister for External Territories and  1  submit to you as persuasively as I can that the submission should be rejected for the following reasons: When we have a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loan Bill before us, it normally is for. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* On this occasion, the proposed <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loan is to support the budget of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the funds provided by the loan will be spent also on civil aviation facilities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* In other words, it is a loan from international markets which will contribute to the budget of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* It is a very different loan Bill from the normal ones and I am entitled, I submit, under this particular Bill, to make reference to these matters which will come naturally, under the aegis of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> budget. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* It refers to the financing of public works and services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which does not cover civil aviation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* The ruling given by the Chair - I reiterate it now - was that the Bill does not cover civil aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* The reason for the Bill is so that this guarantee may be expressed in the prospectus so that people can be satisfied that a close relationship exists between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* This is the very difference between this Bill and any other loan Bill that has come before this House relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* It is stressing the guarantee we are giving and providing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the opportunity to go elsewhere. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wishes to undertake an overseas borrowing as soon as possible in order that it may establish a favourable standing in international capital markets before it becomes independent, as this could enhance its borrowing prospects thereafter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* A contractual guarantee by the Australian Government for such a borrowing should ensure the success of this first issue and will materially assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in furthering Otis longer term objective. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* Treasurer in that regard and therefore the remarks I made related to the very point of the close relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the need for this to continue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* If I feel that the Ministers go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> without an open mind and not prepared to negotiate, the matter will be raised as trenchantly as possible, because it is so important to the future relations of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and, in particular, to the future development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* What is more important to New Guinea than any warnings of mine is that it be recognised by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation, that he should cease jeopardising relations; that he should cease forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to look elsewhere; that he should cease jeopardising goodwill; that he should desist from brutal, rude, arrogant and colonial views; and that he should go with an open mind to negotiate and not to dictate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* It is with that viewpoint in mind that the Opposition supports this Bill which gives support to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* We trust that the negotiations on Friday will not broaden the difficulties of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in negotiating what is their own national airline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* It relates to the future of the new nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as regards currency and what will happen to this loan and other loans if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> establishes its own separate currency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* That is all very well in the present circumstance where the currencies of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are one and the same, but what happens after independence when the currencies may differ, if, for any reason, the parity between the currencies of the two countries differs, or in particular if, as so often happens with developing countries - I do not criticise them for so doing - it wants to devalue its currency? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* Will the Australian Government pay devaluation compensation, as it were, to the creditors of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on this loan if that country wants to devalue? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* This is a very important matter because I think that in this circumstance, with a government to government loan, Australia should underwrite the loan to the value of Australian currency and offer to offset any loss to the creditor in the event of any devaluation by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I do not believe that we should in any way try to pressure the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into having an over-valued currency. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a typical example of this, lt has a very limited range of exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* Everyone knows that this is a tremendous problem for all developing countries and particularly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I think that the only answer to this is labour intensive industry being developed as far as possible in the smaller towns and villages of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* If the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wants to devalue its currency I hope that under this Bill we will make it as easy as possible for that country to do so by saying: 'Go ahead and do not worry about your international creditors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* Perhaps the Minister might be able to explain what would happen if subsequently the 2 currencies were to go their different ways and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> devalues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* Would Australia pay the devaluation compensation to the creditors, or is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> expected to pay? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* The alternative understanding would be that only if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defaulted on the loan altogether would Australia have to pay. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* I have spoken to a number of people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and I believe that perhaps they are a little too eager at times to bring foreign investment into their country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* For that reason while I support this measure I think we should point out to our friends in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration that, while we approve of such ventures, we hope that they will look very hard before going too strongly after private capital investment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* What will happen if the Australian Government decides that it does not want to become an imperialist power by becoming the landlord of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and owning all the industry and investment in thai country? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0)

* If we leave <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our place is taken by Japan or some other country I am sure that many Australians would not regard that as being in our national interests.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0)

* To avoid the situation whereby the cessation of an Australian Act would leave a vacuum in the law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it is proposed that the application of an Australian Act, particularly for which there is no <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> counterpart, will in general not be discontinued until and unless that cessation has been approved by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government.

* It may be that some aspects of that Act, as part of Australian law, but no longer as part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> law, will require amendment to protect the rights under Australian law of persons, matters or things connected with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or to make provision for the occurrence of matters in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affecting Australia but not <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0)

* As the honourable member for Macarthur pointed out, even at the d:te of self government - an historic occasion on which there will be ratification of the control of a function that has virtually been controlled for at least 12 months because self government has virtually been operating within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for this period of time - there will be a certain amount of turbulence and enthusiasm that will probably lead to a number of social problems.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0)

* I am not at all concerned about that situation because it encourages me to believe that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, during the year or so prior to independence and in the years following independence, will be loath to spend money on military equipment and also to believe that the Australian people prefer to be in the position where they are able to recognise, in some way or another - perhaps by some mutual defence treaty or agreement - that we will be prepared to look after the external relations of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> conjointly in the future.

* As I pointed out in my second reading speech, these are historic Bills but I believe that with the co-operation of all groups within Australia, with the continuing cooperation of the Government, the House of Assembly and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> we can bring about an orderly transfer of authority from a colonial power to its former colony.

* Using a word that the Minister used so freely in his speech, I refer to the hypocrisy of the attitude of this Government when one sees what it is doing in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by speeding it to selfgovernment and independence and compare that with the callous attitude of the Minister towards the people of these 2 Territories.

* At this stage when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is in practice self-governing and only awaits amendment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act to become formally self-governing, it is interesting to recall the origin of Australia's policy for the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* Nearly 28 years ago a former Minister for External Territories,  Mr Eddie  Ward, when introducing the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Provisional Administration Bill, said: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* Australian economic aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the past 10 years was provided largely as backing for development based on the concepts of a World Bank Mission of 1963. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* One of the Mission's basic principles was that expenditure and manpower should be concentrated in areas and on activities where the prospective return was highest and this meant that the benefits of development did not reach quite a large number of Papua New Guineans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is now rightly concerned about this and the present inequalities between rural and urban populations, between expatriates and Papua New Guineans, between Papua New Guineans and between districts within the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* The Australian Government is happy to support this basic purpose of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government with an assurance of continuing economic aid. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* Our aid program for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be developed in cooperation and consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* It has always been Australia's aim that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should, as soon as possible, achieve a much greater degree of financial and economic viability than it now has, but the Australian Government has given the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government an assurance that, it is prepared to continue providing substantial aid not only up to independence but also beyond. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* The degree of economic stability that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has achieved is such that it was able to overcome the acute problems of the past 12 months caused by the laying off of workers on completion of the construction phase of the Bougainville copper project, the very low world prices for rural products and the effect of the rearrangement of exchange rates of its trading partners and exports competitors. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* It cannot be denied that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will still face difficult problems as do all other countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* The important difference is that the decisions affecting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are now being made by the elected representatives of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* We in the Government, and I am sure that here I can speak on behalf of the Opposition, have every reason for confidence that the Government which has emerged in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has the ability to carry the country forward to viable nationhood.

* With the coming of self-government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our continuing commitment to maintain substantial aid to that country, it is essential that our aid programs are rationally determined and efficiently administered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* I want to make these points about Australia's relationship with Indonesia: There have been harmonious conclusions to the negotiations on the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia since the Australian Labor Government took office on 2 December. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* Unless this Parliament is prepared to look after those who have served this country and the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I believe that our responsibilities as parliamentarians will not have been met properly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* We have been maligned for our handling of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* The recent statement by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  regarding the independence timetable clearly shows that, despite our eagerness to give an early opportunity for self-government and independence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we are keenly aware of the need to co-operate with those whose responsibility it will be to effect the completion of the task. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* Turning to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, with which the Minister has a very special relationship, I would like to say that as from 1 December, as has been already said to the House by the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  there will be a substantial change in the responsibilities of the Minister's Department. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* The Minister will be operating under the Minister for Foreign Affairs and looking after the special relationships between the Australian Government and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* One of the ways in which I believe this can be done, particularly in view of the propaganda that is going on at the present time about the world's energy problems, is to invite or influence the Government in Port Moresby to try to accelerate the exploration programs that are being carried out within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in an effort to identify the ore bodies, to find oil and to develop the resources of that nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* If United States know-how through companies of this nature can be encouraged to an even greater degree to come to the Territory there may be some possibility of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> more quickly reaching the stage where it will be able to develop its own programs and to stand to a greater degree than ever before on its own feet in terms of financial assistance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* I believe Australians should have the courage, at least in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to face the future and say: 'We will stand with you and by some formal contract we will undertake to look after your defence, internally and externally, over the next 15 years'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* I can see no earthly reason why we should have to apologise to anyone of any colour anywhere else, in any government in the world or in the United Nations, for our particular interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our particular obligation to see that that country is developed and preserved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14)

* I have mentioned previously the contribution that was made by the delegation from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the maturity that was shown by its leader and members. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* He explained that most of this increase would occur in relation to aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that it relates to that country's movement towards self-government and independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* The purpose of the various external economic aid programs undertaken by Australia to assist developing countries, including <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, is, of course, to assist those countries to attain more rapid economic growth and higher living standards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* I do not oppose the move to grant selfgovernment to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 1 December next. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* But in regard to independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> I believe that Australia should not fix the date. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* I do agree, though, that Australia must be prepared to continue for quite some time in the future to provide financial aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a near neighbour with whom we will all want to remain on friendly terms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* Expenditure on our bilateral aid programs - excluding <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - is estimated to increase by just over $6m in the current year to a total of nearly $67m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* I hope that the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  and the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  will pardon me if I move away from the theme of the Middle East and return to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which we were discussing earlier in this debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* I want to put on the record of the Committee, in relation to future defence relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the words of Professor J. D. B. Miller who, earlier this year, had this to say: [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* Australia has been gravely at fault in delaying so long the separation of the armed forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* Frantic efforts are being made to separate them out, but it is proving a much harder task than it would have been even a few years ago: as the Australian defence organisation has grown more complex, so have run deeper the roots which have to be pulled up in order to make a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence organisation a separate body. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* The forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should have been under the control of the local Administrator and accounted for in the local budget, even if we put up most of the money. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* Now everything has to be done in a hurry, and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which has never had to pay for its armed forces, is faced with the prospect either of paying for them all of a sudden, which would be financially ruinous, or of getting rid of  them, which might be socially disastrous, or of asking the former colonial power to pay for them, which is potentially troublesome from a political standpoint. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* I am thus suggesting that Australia will need to face the preparation of both a general independence treaty and a defence agreement, the terms of which should be worked out with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> government and publicised in both countries so that people can digest them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* If, for example, we do not have a clear and precise defence agreement which describes the circumstances in which Australia would be prepared to consider a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> government's call for armed intervention, say in a case similar to the East African mutinies in 1964 or in the event of regional insurgency, we shall be in real trouble. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26)

* Personally, I want these occasions to be as few as possible, and I do not want Australia to police <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; but misunderstandings are much less likely if the possibilities are spelled out beforehand than if they are left in a fog.

* Throughout our period in Opposition I have consistently pointed to the consistent policy of the Liberal Party when in Government that the decision on the date for independence must not rest with this Parliament but with the Parliament in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* The Chief Minister has indicated, by foreshadowing a motion, that during April or May the matter will be fully discussed and debated and the decision will be taken by the elected leaders of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the House of Assembly, and we welcome that.

* Secondly, on 'behalf of the Liberal Party since we have been in Opposition and following the viewpoints that I expressed when previously I was Minister for External Territories, I said that not only did we have a duty to ensure the smooth and orderly transition through self-government to independence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but also we had a basic duty to ensure that both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia fully understood the nature of the relationship in a post-independence situation; that it would not be good enough to arrive at a date for independence and pass through it and then start discussions on the nature of the relationship between the then independent country of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia.

* In addition to those serving in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> office within the present Department of Foreign Affairs, there should have been an additional cell which was operating specifically on postindependence relations.

* The first is the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  who is culpable to the Australian nation for not advising this Parliament and the Australian people of what steps have been taken to determine the size, structure and role of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence forces during this period of self-government prior to independence when I would remind honourable members that we are still internationally responsible and answerable to the United Nations for matters of internal security but particularly of defence security.

* Take note that there will be some in the independent country of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - if they decide that 1 December is to be their date for independence - who will not tolerate dogmatic views that this Government with a stroke of a pen can change these boundaries.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* When we were in government we hoped to arrive at a situation prior to independence where, because of the progressive involvement of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leaders in the whole range of government activities and responsibilities there would be no sphere in which the newly independent country would find itself unfamiliar or lacking experience.

* The people of New Guinea have, particularly over the last 18 months through their leadership group, been taking an increasing interest in developments in South East Asia - to an even greater extent than in Australia - in that to the west of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and sharing a common land border is part of the largest of the countries of that region.

* Governments, and parties on both sides of this House, however, have rightly seen the necessity for the transition of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as soon as possible to independence, the date for which has been proclaimed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* As one who has been interested in and concerned with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for many years I think I must express a fear that there is still so much to be done; a fear that in the short time left before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> takes the final step there are perhaps many areas which will not be adequately completed to enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as an independent country to have as easy a transition as we would wish. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* Yet I think it should be said of both my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  who has just spoken, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in matters relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>  (Mr Morrison),  that each in his own way, as have successive Administrators of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as well as the expatriate public servants who worked first for the Department of External Territories and now within its current role as a sub-department of the Prime Minister's Department, have done their utmost to ensure that the deficiencies have been overcome and the educative processes have been effectively achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* The first that worries me is the degree to which there have been between the Government of Australia and the now self governing body that controls <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> discussions about the way in which relations in the areas remaining to be resolved could be concluded before independence is achieved. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* The first area is the role of the Regiment which operates in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and which was initially entirely under Australian control and command but which has a progression through the ranks of indigenous Papuans and New Guineans and which until independence will still remain the responsibility of the Government of this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I believe that it is most tragic that there has not been a meaningful discussion between the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the people of the Torres Strait Islands, the Government of Queensland and the Federal Government to ensure that there could be some progress towards resolving the territorial boundaries in the Torres Strait. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I believe, however, that there are other issues which must be of concern to this Parliament and which today and henceforth will be the responsibility of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* As <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is our closest neighbour and a country for which we have exercised responsibility for so long, I 'believe it behoves us to express our concern about these issues. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I know that education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has advanced significantly in recent years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* However, I am concerned and have been concerned that in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as in many other lesser developed countries, there has been a tendency to encourage education at a university level and a failure to build up the understanding that people with technical skills, with the semiskilled and skilled role that they can play in the infrastructure of the community will probably be more significant than those who have graduate or postgraduate degrees. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* Certainly in terms of the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the immediate future it is important that there be a proper balance of skilled personnel. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* Indeed, I believe that in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as in many other countries, undue weight has been given to university training and the balance of incentive provided for persons to acquire job training in the various trades and the other skilled and semiskilled roles in society has not been given sufficient weight. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I hope that these deficiences will be recognised by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that there will be an insurance that, in the development of educational facilities in this about to be independent country, there will not be the ill consequences that seem to have befallen so many other countries moving into independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* The other area that concerns me - it has not been touched on although my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong briefly adverted to it - is the geographic position of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to Indonesia, South East Asia and the islands of the Pacific. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* Obviously, in the ethnic background of their people, those island states of the Pacific have much in common with the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* But for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in its geographic lie it is important that it enjoys strong and fraternal relationships with Indonesia and all the surrounding countries of South East Asia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* It is important that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is able to play a role with those countries not just towards collectively developing an economic strength but towards collectively recognising the ability of each other to play an independent role - a role without intervention of neighbouring countries, a role which will enable each of these countries to give to their people the same opportunities for peace and prosperity as those who are residents of Australia enjoy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* It is important in the future development of relations between an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that relationships with each of the countries in this region be fostered and encouraged. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* One hopes that it is possible that there be maintained a very strong fraternal relationship in the evolution of foreign policy which, passing as it will from the date of independence to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, can still involve a measure of consultation which will ensure that Australia can assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the formulation of the new relationships which one hopes can lead to the achievement of the objectives about which I have just spoken. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* The ethnic divisions that exist in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the problems of communication, the divisions that are unfortunately apparent between the people of Papua and those of New Guinea and the concern that many people in several areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> feel about the move into independence are problems that today will and henceforth be the responsibility of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I would like to compliment  Mr Michael  Somare, the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for the way in which and by which he has been able to unite these different factions and differing ethnic peoples in this transition today into self-government and tomorrow into independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I believe that this fraternal relationship at a personal level is imperative at a stage where, regrettably, there is still a weakness in the infrastructures of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as it moves in this final step to independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* Indeed, I think that probably the first visit I made outside Australia as the Minister for Defence was to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the purpose of discussing with the then Executive Council, with  Mr Maori-Kiki  and with the Chief Minister,  Mr Somare,  the question of defence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* Again, to spell it out for the honourable member for Kooyong, the Australian Government's view remains that it would be extremely reluctant to become involved in an internal security situation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* As I have said, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government shares this view. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* In the words of  Mr Kiki,  the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was determined to look after its own security problems in the future'. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* Surely in these circumstances what one should do as a responsible Minister for Defence in the Australian Government is to ensure that there are continued discussions and negotiations with officials of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Defence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* As I indicated to the House a few moments ago, we agreed during discussions on my first visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that there would be continued discussions between representatives of the Australian Department of Defence and the administration in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I have had the opportunity on a number of occasions to discuss these matters with the Chief Minister,  Mr Somare,  together with the Minister for Science in the Australian Government and, naturally, we have had discussions which concern the internal security of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* On each occasion it has been made clear to us that the responsibility for internal security in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence will be the responsibility of those authorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* On every occasion the proposition has been put to me as the Minister for Defence, I think responsibly and in the way that these things should be done, by the Minister for Defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Albert  Maori-Kiki. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I am happy to assure the honourable member for Kooyong that those discussions were mutually advantageous and, as a result of our last discussions, Australia will take part in a continuing defence aid program for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* As I said, it has been made clear by both the Chief Minister and the Minister for Defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the question of the internal security arrangements of that country will rest primarily with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> police force. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* So, in this respect, there have been meaningful discussions on the role of the police force in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence and, again, assistance will be provided to that country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* In conclusion may I say that it is quite clear that the Australian Government has acted quite properly in meeting the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations and of the Chief Minister on all occasions when he has sought discussions with me on this question. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0)

* I conclude by pointing out to the honourable member for Kooyong that it would not be possible for one to make any statement in the House on what are very important matters for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, particularly in relation to defence and our aid program for defence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence which, as I have said, will continue, until these discussions with the responsible Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have been concluded.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21)

* I recognise that we must respond primarily to the viewpoint of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in these areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21)

* It has been proposed that there should be some form of quadripartite arrangement between Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to get the 2 regions together.

* I wish to turn now to one or two matters concerning foreign affairs in view of the fact that at the end of this year <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will become an independent country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29)

* Therefore I want to put to the House my views on what must be in effect the future relationships between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29)

* If events confirm the suspicions of my friend from Mackellar and if governments in Peking, Moscow and other places begin to exert pressure on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it is only to Australia that Port Moresby will be able to look for support - moral, financial and physical. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29)

* It is important that we make it clear to the rest of the world that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be able to rely upon Australia to a degree and in a manner that in all probability it will not be able to rely upon any other country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29)

* 1 say to honourable members that if events of this nature were to develop in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it would not be the people in London but it would be the people here in Canberra who would have to make decisions in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> similar to those that were made by the honourable and gallant gentlemen in the House of Commons about Malaysia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29)

* Honourable members will recall that on 23 August last year the then Minister for External Territories introduced the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Application of Laws) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0)

* The majority of Australia's aid will continue to be directed to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for which we have a special responsibility which will not cease when it attains independence on 1 December 1974. lt is anticipated that our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be at least $500m over the next 3 years and this must absorb much of our attention.

* The Prime Minister's announcement only a week or so ago that the Government has undertaken to provide for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is about to become independent, a sum of approximately $A500m over the next 3 years indicates one of the ways by which bilateral aid can give to a country - in this instance one so close to Australia - a feeling of economic confidence which I am sure was material in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> being able to set a date for independence.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* As I have pointed out, I do not want to unduly restrict debate but I think it is not proper to enter into a debate on the pros and cons of where the border of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia should be. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Without this amendment during the period between selfgovernment and Independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* The question that arises is whether there is a difference of opinion between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and ourselves over the extent to which we should restrain our proclamation over those waters and the extent to which we should move the boundary. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* The Commonwealth Government has not responded to it but the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has himself said that he must deal with the Commonwealth Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Without this amendment, during the period between self-government and independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I also remind the honourable member for Kooyong that the question of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> border does not come within the provisions of this legislation, as I stated previously. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Without a doubt the Bill now before the House, as stated by the Minister in the second reading speech, will enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to establish its own fisheries powers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Visiting United Nations commissions, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs of this Australian Parliament in 1966 and this new Australian Government have indicated that there ought to be changes but the last named has done nothing about it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* It was legitimate to raise it because what is involved in this legislation is not just the transfer of fisheries control but the transfer of legislative and administrative functions to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and it relates to the jurisdiction over proclaimed waters - what we have referred to here as Australian proclaimed waters between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia.

* This Bill goes along with the wishes of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which wishes its fishing boats to be treated as foreign boats. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats have been fishing in the area for many years; we have never restricted them. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

*  The Opposition supports this Bill, but it is concerned that in a discussion about fishing there should be a recognition of the implications of the transfer of powers, which the Fisheries (<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Boats) Bill is all about. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* It is intended to make sure that the foreign boat category includes boats of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the same way as Australian legislation now excludes all other boats. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* That is that the Bill is part of the transfer of powers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards its exercising of the complete functions of a self governing independent country as from 1 December 1974. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* In passing the powers from the Australian Parliament to that of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the legislation does not canvass the implications of fishing and the intertwining of fishing rights in areas that are adjacent to both countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Indeed, the necessity for the legislation to recognise licences granted under Australian legislation for boats registered in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> comes out of the specific exclusion that is within clause 4 of the Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* The agreement arrived at in initial discussions that took place between Chief Minister Michael Somare, my friend the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  who spoke a few moments ago, and I for the purpose of trying to establish a basis by which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats could operate in Australian proclaimed waters has largely been adopted in subsequent discussions between the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and Chief Minister Somare. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* It is a difficult area because the boats that are operating from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> waters fall into the 2 classes to which I have referred. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* There is no dispute about the rights of the indigenous Papuan New Guinea fishermen operating in waters in the Torres Strait and elsewhere where the 2 countries traditionally or Papua New Guineans in particular and people from the Torres Strait Islands have exercised their fishing interests. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* The difficulties that have emerged have come out of the very natural desire that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has had to see its fishing responsibilities extended into a viable commercial arena. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Some Middle East capital has been invested in fishing operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* We were conscious in the discussions with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that it was necessary that we try to meet the twin objectives of encouraging <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s commercial development of a fishing industry on a larger scale, but equally of not prejudicing the operation of Australian fishing boats. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* A reasonable compromise has been reached and I hope that in the operation of future agreements that will be necessary for fishing in Australian proclaimed waters it will continue to be possible for a reconciliation of the difficulties that we see in meeting these twin objectives, namely, that of encouraging <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s commercial development and a commercial fishing industry without prejudicing the operation of Australian fishing boats, particularly in the Gulf of Carpenteria. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* But I did want to advert to fishing in this area because I believe that we have an interest in Australia in helping <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards the establishment of a commercial industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* It is a particular problem because of the dispute which still exists between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia over the future territorial boundaries between the 2 countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I think it is important that we recognise that a great deal needs to be done for a country like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as for Australia, to ensure that there is adequate knowledge of what the fish, sea and ocean resources might be before the full advantages of this other form of natural resource can be exploited. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I hope that in the transfer of power there will continue to be co-operation in the field of developing an understanding of what ocean resources exist, to what extent they might be available for exploitation and how they can be best turned to the commercial advantage of both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I think that apart from the general aid that we provide for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, meaningful financial assistance can be provided specifically in this field, in order to ensure that both countries understand their ocean resources and that both countries can utilise them in terms of the exercise of their own sovereign responsibilities - that which is about to be exercised as a result of the passage of this Bill and that which is still exercised and will continue to be exercised by Australian governments in the exercise of their residual fishing responsibility within our own constitutional responsibility and within our own territorial waters and proclaimed waters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I believe that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would have a common interest in ensuring the maximum possible jurisdiction over fishing within this legislation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Whatever the resolution of the extent of territorial waters, I believe that it is important for countries like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia not only to gain the maximum jurisdiction over these waters but also to ensure that they take advantage of the fishing rights within those waters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* As I have said, it is also important that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia maintain a research program and a co-operative effort. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I believe that we have to be very conscious of the effect that any licenses which are granted for the commercial exploitation of fishing waters, particularly those Australian proclaimed waters to the north in which a commercial industry operating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> might wish to fish, might have on the interests of indigenous Australian fishermen. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* The Bill simply transfers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a responsibility which in the past we have exercised. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* But in the exercise of the responsibility which henceforth will be that of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there is I think a necessity for both of our countries to maintain the closest possible liaison to ensure that the fishing and ocean resources can be exploited to the mutual advantage of both of our countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* The honourable member stated that the Government had done nothing since coming to office to resolve the border dispute between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* On IS December 1972 when I was half the Government I wrote to the Premier of Queensland suggesting that officials of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Queensland and the Australian Government hold discussions on this issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* When this week the Premier of Queensland proposed to telephone the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> about the matter, the Chief Minister got in touch with me and I encouraged a discussion between him and the Premier. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* When <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent, presumably before the end of this year, negotiations will take place - as international law negotiations can only take place - between the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments only. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* However, in view of the Premier's changed attitude about discussions with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, I have again invited him to take part in official discussions with the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments with a view to reaching an agreed settlement. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Just as in this country the fishing industry is one of the most rapidly developing primary industries, so I am sure the development and exploitation of the fisheries resources will be important to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Historically the industry in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been a fairly simple one - simple in the sense of the equipment which has been used until now. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* As in Australia there is a growing emphasis on larger vessels and more sophisticated equipment, this change in emphasis will apply to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, although perhaps not to quite the same degree. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Of course historically these resources have been a considerable source of protein in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that will continue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* But if experience along the northern Australian coast is any guide - I am sure that it is - there must be considerable opportunities for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to develop and expand an export industry in fisheries products. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* As I was saying, there will be every opportunity for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through development of its fisheries resources not only to make a valuable contribution to its own food supplies but also, if experience in northern Australian waters is a guide - I said I thought it would be a guide - to develop export possibilities for the fishing industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Certainly in the earlier days of independence <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have difficulty finding the research funds which will be necessary to determine all that needs to be known about its fishing grounds, the types of fish available, their habits and so on. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* It is also true that a great deal of the research in Australian fishery resources is being carried out in waters adjacent to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> "waters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* With all that research going on up there, basically for our own purposes, I hope that as results that could be valuable to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> become available the Austraiian Government will see to it that that country is kept informed of the latest results of our research in those waters so that in turn <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can benefit from it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* No doubt eventually <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will initiate projects of its own, but in the early days I believe that Australia can make a valuable contribution without any additional expenditure of money - merely by seeing that what benefits we have gained from our research are, if applicable, communicated to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Here again I imagine that our own Department of Primary Industry and perhaps the Department of Health could be of considerable assistance in advising <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on standards required in processing plants and the testing of samples to make sure that they comply with international world health standards. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* The Bill before the House is of very great significance because it facilitates the full administrative arrangements necessary in the self-government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in respect of the fishing industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I am sure that this House would want to assist the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the greatest possible extent in the smoothest possible transference of powers of this kind. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* Firstly, there is the circumstance that fishing is really part and parcel of the sustenance of very many people around the coastline of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and in particular it is of great importance to their welfare and their future stability in terms not only of sustenance but also of the gradual development of commercial fishing. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* In that area lying between the territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia there has been a degree of concern as to the future of the actual line of demarcation; in other words, the border between the 2 territories. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I believe it is a matter of extreme importance from the point of view of our relationships with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to co-operate in every way to ensure that the administration of the fishing industry avoids any of the sensitive areas of administration which so often cause friction between countries. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* We must take another aspect into consideration, namely, the carry through of what I was saying about the importance of fishing to the individual Papua New Guineans along the coastline. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* With the advent of scientific techniques in fishing around the world and with the gradual development of standards in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, undoubtedly a situation will arise in which more sophisticated equipment will be used than hitherto has been the case. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I presume too that we have assisted to make possible the best law for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and in so doing have ensured that the interpretation of that law will apply in the interests of both countries, because it would be folly indeed for us to have a situation in which there was any variation in interpretation of the fishing laws of Australia and the fishing laws of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* One can well imagine similar situations arising in the waters of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, bearing in mind that undoubtedly commercial fishing ventures will be developed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> waters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* These commercial ventures could be undertaken for the very good reason that the fishing grounds of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have already been assessed and shown to have good resources in the various categories of fish. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0)

* I believe that there can be an effective relationship between our 2 countries provided that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> does not grant rights that are too easily won, or should I say that do not involve reasonable conditions and restraints on those who might want to go into ventures that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may propose or that others may propose to it.

* I hope that we will be co-operating closely with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to ensure that it too observes this most necessary precaution - a precaution that could well mean that in the long term we preserve an effective supply of fish, fish oil and other fish products to sustain the protein requirements of big consumers of fish and at the same time to participate in the world market for the supply of fish from the seas.

* I thought that we would have heard more of the negotiations between the Government of Australia and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in regard to these 2 specific areas of foreign affairs and defence before any likely date of independence was announced.

* It is interesting that the Constitutional Planning Committee should accuse the Government of that, because it is described in the terminology of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a radical body, but it has felt that this Government has forced the pace somewhat.

* I think that overall the Government has responded to the wishes of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but it seems to me that it would have been wise to settle all areas prior to independence so that on independence the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government would not just in fact be governing in all areas but would be doing so at law.

* I just wanted to flag the fact that I am concerned that for almost 20 months now I have been standing here asking for information about the defence arrangements between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia, and I ask for it again in the course of this debate because the Minister himself has said in his own speech that this legislation is part of the movement towards independence.

* As I understand it, officials of the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government- I do not know about representatives of the Torres Strait Islanders, although they are Australian citizens and ought to be involved- and officials of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government have been meeting to talk about the border.

* According to the Minister, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has agreed in the exchange of correspondence or by some other means to abide by the agreements on the environment and on restricting itself to the adjacent areas of Queensland and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which is confined to the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the areas designated as adjacent areas.

* It appears to me that a fact that has been neglected is that although the largest single increase in this year's aid allocation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is for employment termination and retirement benefits for Australians leaving <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the amount involved is more than double the total increase in aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* My cursory examination of the documents revealed to me that $43m of an amount which was provided last year for a wide variety of functions that were transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government- a transfer of functions is involved in this legislation; that is why I have referred to this matter,  Mr Speakerwas  not required under the items for the transfer of functions and that it has not been re-allocated or that very little of it has been re-allocated to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself but has gone elsewhere.

* The actual amount- the real amount- given to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the Australian Government has been exacerbated by inflation anyway, and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself has grave inflationary problems.

* I was saying that we had hoped that the process of independence would be gradual- not gradual in the sense that it necessarily would be slow but that it would be smooth and not a sudden break from one status and set of reponsibilities to another, which are words that will be familiar to some in this House- so that when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s independence came it would signify the last step in a long process that had been taken and that a whole series of changes would not be occurring overnight.

* Although the function of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s foreign relations is reserved to Australia, the policy of the Australian Government has been to involve fully <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to exercise that function only after the fullest consultation with and advice from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0)

* Consistent with this policy Australia has encouraged <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to take its place in the international community and one example of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s increasing involvement in this community was its participation in the recent Law of the Sea Conference in Caracas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0)

* The reason I said that it was sloppy was because my understanding of the boundary mentioned in the Schedule to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is that the boundary is in fact inaccurate, that it was drawn in 1967 and that maps subsequent to that date which I recall having seen reveal that part of the description in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in fact covers the land mass of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0)

* -It is grossly unfair of the Minister to say that because he is well aware that boundaries and areas in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had to be changed and amended geographically following the use of up-to-date mapping techniques and that areas that were subsequently opened up were drawn more accurately later on.

* But we wish that this Government would be more precise in the nature of the legislation it introduces and ensure that where there are anomalies in the geographic areas it would seek to clear them up rather than bury them amongst the morass of material that is discussed between the governments of Queensland, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia.

* We commend the provisions dealing with the lower courts, the House of Assembly, electoral matters and trie repeal of appeals to the High Court of Australia, just as we commend the smooth and early transition of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

* Whilst I was the Minister for External Territories the Government of which I was a member agreed that we would discuss well before independence what the relations after independence would be, on the very axiomatic point that this takes some time to develop, that it would not be in Australia's national interest or indeed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s interest to wait until the date is reached and then look at one another, as it were, and determine how we are going to go about things. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

* It is important because after this piece of legislation apart from, as I understand it, certain Australian defence legislation that applies equally to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will have to be eradicated so that it applies only to Australia, there will be an independence Bill and the final obliteration of the remnants of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act which is being amended by this Bill, and little else.

* I would say that if we examine the relationship between metropolitan powers and administered entities- whether it be with African countries, whether it be Fiji and the United Kingdom or what other entity one chooses- we would see that there has probably not been an administered area which was as close to the metropolitan power, not geographically but in the way it moved towards its independence- as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> used to be to us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

* And, of course, the words of the Minister a couple of weeks ago in a statement in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> conflicted with a statement he made in this House, or appeared to do so by Press reports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

* I think that the honourable member with his keen awareness of the developments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would recognise that in fact, in reality, there was no distinction between what he said and what he was reported to have said but a very real distinction between either one of the variants that have been put to us and what was said here.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

* For what the Government will find is that in a matter of months when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent, the matter may not be resolved and we may have what history is replete with, namely territorial disputes causing more than casual friction between the countries concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

* These powers will cease to be reserve powers to Australia- reserve in the sense that when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> achieved self government on 1 December 1973 certain powers remained with the metropolitan powerAustralia namely, defence, foreign affairs, the supreme court and certain other stated matters.

* Frankly, as I read them, these 5 pages of that statement seem to me to be a rhetorical embellishment of what we knew, that is that Australia has been abdicating its duties and its responsibilities in determining a proper and cohesive arrangement between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* No one in this Parliament or outside it has spoken with greater confidence about the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and about its leaders than I have, but it seems to me that there is a profound duty- which has not yet been executed- on this Government to tell us just what will be the role of those servicemen if in fact there is any requirement for them to be used up there.

* If I make no point other than that, I ask that, prior to legislation coming into this Parliament, the Minister at the table, who is the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, advise the Minister for Defence that I expect when he brings in Bills amending Australian legislation applying in the defence area, which also extends into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, that he will let us know that he has completed discussions or that he has entered into arrangements.

* I think that in the present circumstances this Government and the people of Australia should show a greater sense of responsibility towards the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and their leaders, than perhaps we did when we had the responsibility for the trusteeship, the care and the progress of the future of the country.

* While the 2 measures we are debating may merely be machinery matters, I think that they emphasise that not sufficient attention has been given by the Government to many of the problems that will be associated with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> obtaining independence and going into the future as an independent nation.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0)

* I am sure honourable members understand from the background in which we have been operating, with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> finding its own way to its own point of view and its own attitude, that we have not been able to make definite statements but I can assure members of the Opposition that as soon as we possibly can make public the results of the continuing discussions we have had with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> these matters will be the subject of a statement in the House.

* Whilst I endorse the Bills and the Opposition supports them, I have to note that I was somewhat disappointed that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his speech on this legislation spent so much time on selfcongratulatory language about the role of the Australian Labor Party in allegedly decolonising <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that by his incorporation in  Hansard  of lengthy statements from 1970 he proffered the oft-quoted view that it was he, as the then Leader of the Opposition, who really brought about this decolonisation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0)

* It was he who perceived the need to make these changes, in a somewhat dramatic way, speeding up the process and transferring more authority to the Ministers and the Assistant Ministers in the former United Party Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1970.

* Indeed, if I may say so in using the first personal pronoun, I was fortunate enough to participate as Minister for External Territories in the first of the series of constitutional talks between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in July 1972.

* After the impetus of the transfer of activities in 1970 providing more responsibility and decision making for the Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, those talks in 1972 were the first government to government talks ever held between our 2 countries.

* With the possible exception of the relationship between Britain and Fiji- I do not think even that is pertinent to this case- I would think that there are no other countries in the world that can say that they were on such close terms, following such earnest preparedness for independence, as Australia as the administering authority and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as the territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0)

* Bearing in mind the incorporation by the Prime Minister at the end of his speech of some of his previous statements, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  at the end of this address a speech on future relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> delivered by me to the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs.

* Nor as I have said earlier should we expect that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s national interests will not over the years, as they are better defined and as Papua New Guinean political leaders become more conscious of them, more and more diverge from Australia's.

* If mutual respect accompanies it, if we can succeed in avoiding gratuitous insults to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s nationhood and sovereignty, then that residual common interest will be of great importance. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0)

* My reason for quoting that is that we come to the stage where <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- albeit she has had her own Foreign Relations and Defence Minister and has had her own staff at missions abroad- will now in law as well as in fact be conducting her own foreign policy and conducting it as it suits her interests and not necessarily Australia's interests.

* It is the end of the formal association whereby Australia ceases to have any sovereignty over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at midnight on 15 September thus enabling the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Constitution to have effect on 16 September, that Constitution not being dependent on any legislative authority from Australia under this legislation.

* Throughout the constitutional process toward independence I have stressed that both the move to self government, which was agreed during our period in government, and this last step to independence were primarily motivated by decisions of the political leadership of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and responded to by ourselves.

* It might be wiser to wait until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is independent and executes her agreement to those relations or to whatever formal arrangements are to be entered into as an independent country so that there can be no accusation that she was coerced into those agreements before independence was reached.

* The overriding thought that preoccupies one on this occasion is not to think back so much -both the Prime Minister and myself have probably spent too much time doing that thinking back over our administrations and congratulating ourselves for what we have done- but what <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is going to do.

* Whatever the views of the Australian Government about the rights or wrongs of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> claim for an adjustment to the border, that Government- whatever its political complexion- would have been faced on the one hand by a clear demand for adjustment by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and on the other by the unwillingness of the Queensland Government to accept any change. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0)

* The Australian Government, therefore, from the outset, made clear its position that the location of the border should be determined by negotiation between the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments, with the Australian Government accepting the responsibility to take account of the constitutional and other interests of the Government of the State of Queensland and particularly to protect the interests of Torres Strait Islanders.

* In discussions in January 1973 with  Mr Somare,  then Chief Minister of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I expressed quite clearly the Government's desire to resolve this issue in friendly negotiation and indicated that the Government would be most reluctant to accept a settlement of the issue which was unacceptable to Torres Strait Islanders. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0)

* It was evident at this time that complex negotiations between the Australian Government and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would be necessary to resolve these issues and that the Australian Government would need, in parallel with these, to be carrying on discussions with the Torres Strait Islanders and with the Government of Queensland.

* The Conference of Torres Strait Islands Chairmen decided that while they wished to remain free to consider the future of the border between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and their attitude towards it, the following statement could for the present be used by the Australian Government in its discussions as a guide to Torres Strait Islanders' attitude to the questions involved.

* The Islanders believe that the present discussions between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Australian, and Queensland Governments about the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia are based on a misunderstanding of the traditional relationship between Torres Strait Islanders and coastal residents of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Mainland.

* If some change in the border is necessary, the Islanders see no reason why it should run through the proposed protected zone which they believe could be maintained as a region within which Islanders and the coastal peoples of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> bordering on the Straits could live harmoniously as they have in past ages.

* They believe that the Governments of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could work out a form of joint control which would be adequate in a zone where the protection of the environment and the embargo on mining and oil drilling would make many of the issues requiring the exercise of sovereignty unlikely or less difficult.

* There is one very obvious fact relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that is that if Bougainville should secede a very precarious and sensitive situation would arise because the only real and substantial source of income of that nation would suddenly disappear.

* Should their feelings grow to the point where they secede from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a very sensitive and delicate situation would arise in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because that nation would quite suddenly find that it has been deprived of its only source of economic vitality, that is, the income that it derives from the huge copper project on Bougainville.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Having been fortunate enough to have served in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration for 2 years during the fascinating period immediately prior to self-government and independence, I can assure the Committee that our continuing assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> undoubtedly is one of the most significant and useful aspects of our foreign aid program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Our expenditure for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1976-77 will be more than $22 8m. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Our current aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> forms part of the commitment this Government made in March this year to provide $930m to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the 5 years commencing from 1976-77. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* This commitment ensures that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will receive at least $180m in direct social and economic aid for each of the 5 financial years commencing from 1 July this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Such a definite guarantee of a certain minimum level of assistance will be of enormous advantage to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in planning its own Budgets and general financial arrangements. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* As the Committee will be aware, on 16 September this year <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> celebrated its first birthday as an independent nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* It was just over a year ago that Australia voluntarily relinquished control over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after 9 1 years of rule in Papua and some 6 1 years of rule in New Guinea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* That period of Australian administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is, by and large, a period that this country can look upon with reasonable satisfaction. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* That we made some mistakes in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there is no doubt. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* However, on balance, the record of Australian governments of all political persuasions and of the officers of our administration on the spot in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is both competent and just. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* I think we have left <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with 3 notable legacies which our continuing aid should help to maintain. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* The difficult terrain of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, coupled with its 600 or so tribal groupings, meant that a highly decentralised system of district administration was in fact the only viable means of running the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* It is a measure of the effectiveness of the administrative system which we left behind that the new Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has seen fit to more or less leave it intact. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Only during the Japanese occupation of part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during the Second World War did we temporarily place the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under military authority. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Thirdly, we properly prepared <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for a workable system of parliamentary government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Each of these 3 legacies I have mentioned of Australian rule- a sound administration, the maintenance of law and order through civil courts and the civil police, and a workable, democratic Parliament- will, with our continued support of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, help guarantee her stability and that of the surrounding region until well into the future. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* What a future <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has ahead of her if her current performance is any guide. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s main export productscopper, copra, coffee, cocoa and tea- continue to hold their position firmly in international markets. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* But overshadowing all these favourable developments is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s immense potential for the development and export of her vast mineral wealth. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Current exploration work by the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Ok Tedi is but one of several projects that will eventually make <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> one of the wealthiest nations in the South East Asian and the South West Pacific areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* It is worth noting that faith in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s future is obviously shared by that nation's white population as the vast majority of the permanent residents of that section of the population have remained there since self-government and independence and seem to be content to remain for the years to come. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Before concluding I would like to refer briefly to one other specific item in our aid estimates for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* That expenditure is indicative of the enormous importance of an efficient civil aviation network to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for without it the interior of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would still be an unexplored and undeveloped wilderness. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* It is therefore commendable that our aid program has recognised the importance of the necessary support facilities for aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* I conclude by saying how appropriate it is that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  still has as his responsibility <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Our aid program to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a reflection of the continuing goodwill between our 2 nations, and without hesitation I warmly commend it to the House. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* However, I must add that I support the general approach of the Government of aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Both the level and the forward commitment are well tailored to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> 's needs, for the level of aid is such that the growth of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government spending will have to be financed internally while the forward commitment encourages the planning that will make for effective development. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)

* Also, by giving untied rather than project aid, Australia is encouraging <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to take full responsibility for its own affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44)
