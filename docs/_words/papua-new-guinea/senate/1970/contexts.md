* The Prime Minister and the Chief Minister agreed that Australian officials should engage in early discussions with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> officials with a view to seeking provisional agreement between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on issues other than that of territorial sovereignty of the islands.

* The attitude of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government was expressed in another way by  Mr Ebia  Olewale, who is Minister for Education, in a statement reported on 3rd May 1972 in which he said that it was unreasonable to ask <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to put up with a situation which Queensland would not tolerate should the positions be reversed. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0)

* The crux of the matter is that the Commonwealth Government has recognised that the present border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia is in need of adjustment, and having recognised that fact the Government is anxious to arrange a settlement which is in the best interests of all the parties concerned.

* Given this assurance, I underline the point that if this motion is carried and  Senator Byrne's  view, as wrong as it is, is given credence, it could only inhibit future negotiations between 2 sovereign nations - <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the one hand and Australia on the other.

* Finally, I repeat that the issue is not a question of what the situation is tonight because in a very short space of time the Queensland Government will not have responsibility for this matter; it will be the responsibility of a properly elected government of Australia dealing with an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which will be relying on us in all sorts of ways.

* More particularly, it has interested me since publicity has been given to statements made by the present Prime Minister of Australia  (Mr Whitlam)  suggesting that the border between Queensland and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be lowered which would have the effect of handing over certain Torres Strait islands to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> exported some 30,000 tonnes of raw cocoa in the 1971-72 cocoa year, which represented about 2 per cent of world exports. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0)

* In this connection, it was possible to negotiate export control provisions which in effect mean that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s aspirations should be adequately accommodated within the Agreement, lt was determined that some 75 per cent of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s exports is of a type of cocoa which is exempted from export controls, while the remaining 25 per cent will not be subject to controls at present because of the small quantity involved.

* The first loan of$US4.5m was for relending to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank and the Commonwealth guarantee for that loan was approved by the Papau New Guinea Loan (Asian Development Bank) Act 1972.

* Borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration automatically carry a Commonwealth guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1971. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0)

* In practice, however, this provision is usually supplemented in some way for borrowings other than those in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0)

* I would mention that at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s admission to the Asian Development Bank Australia gave an undertaking to the Bank in accordance with Article 3.3 of the agreement establishing the Bank that, until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself assumes responsibility for its own international relations, Australia would be responsible for all obligations that may be incurred by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by reason of its admission to membership in the Bank and enjoyment of the benefits of such membership.

* In addition to guaranteeing the repayment of principal and payment of interest and other charges on the loan until such time as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumes responsibility for its own international relations, the letter gives certain other customary assurances required by the Bank. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0)

* Because these assurances go further than the statutory guarantee already provided under section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act it is necessary for specific Commonwealth legislation to be passed in order for the assurances to constitute valid and binding obligations of the Commonwealth as required by the Bank. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0)

* Perhaps the greatest single need in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the emerging nation which is now is a state of self-government and which will be coming into full nationhood not very far from now, is communications, and roads would stand pre-eminent in that regard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* Under the guidance of the previous Government <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was encouraged, first of all, -to become a member of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and, subsequently, to become a member in its own right of the Asian Development Bank.

* One could construe from that that the guarantee holds good only until such time as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumes its own international status. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* It would be useful for Australia to know whether the guarantee given now holds good for the full term of the loan or whether in any way it is to be set to one side, altered or compromised when the self-governing territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes an independent nation in its own right. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* If <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should achieve independence while any part of the loan is outstanding, Australia will use its best endeavours to ensure the continuing security of the loan and the smooth devolution of responsibility with respect thereto. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* I believe we have done a good job, and that Australians should be proud of the activities of their fellow Australians in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, both in war and peace, irrespective of the governments involved because it has gone on in the period of Liberal governments, Labor governments, and again Liberal governments, and I am sure it will continue during the period of the current Government.

* One could read into that - I do not think this is intended - that if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were to develop a separate currency system from that of Australia - and this has been mentioned in the past as a possibility - then the reading of that paragraph would make it appear as if it is excluded from consideration of the total debt position.

* Next, I should like to quote an interesting comment by  Mr Julius  Chan, the Minister for Finance in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - a fine man whose friendshipI enjoy - in which he mentions that the kind of financial economic situation that one can look at in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the emerging future is to be found in the post-colonial developments in the monetary financial sense of Malaysia and Singapore. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* The general proposition as outlined in  Mr Chan's  comments is that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be a responsible country in the economic and financial sense and will encourage investment of capital in that country for sensible purposes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* I would mention that at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s admission to the Asian Development Bank Australia gave an undertaking to the Bank in accordance with Article 3.3 of the agreement establishing the Bank that, until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself assumes responsibility for its own international relations, Australia would be responsible for all obligations that may be incurred by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by reason of its admission to membership in the Bank and enjoyment of the benefits of such membership. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* That statement predicates the contemplated situation that when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumes political independence a new relationship will develop between Australia and that country in which that country will e considered to be on its own and free from the solicitude, regard and attention that are now being devoted to it by Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* While <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may well achieve political independence very quickly, it will by -no means have achieved economic independence or even complete economic viability. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* Therefore, the Government of this country should still contemplate the fact that, if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in its present position of what we may call dependence receives guarantees from Australia for the Asian Development Bank to support its loan indebtedness, no vastly different position should be allowed to obtain merely with its emergence into independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0)

* We trust that this support, which in this case will improve transportation in one of the areas of the world in which transportation at a high level can be of the very greatest significance, will help to build a transport system through the whole of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> so that, with that as a base, economic improvement and expansion can come all the more quickly, readily and effectively to the emerging independent nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* This situation has come about, of course, by agreement with the previous Government as well as this one that there should be a progressive transfer of power from Australia to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The Bill provides that the Administration will be known as the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Clause 5 also provides that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is a corporate entity which is able to sue and be sued, and make contracts and agreements by that name. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The title of the Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be changed to that of the High Commissioner. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The Bill provides in Clause 8 that subject to the Act the Government shall be administered by the High Commissioner of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* During the self-governing period, the High Commissioner will have 2 functions- those of embryo 'Head of State' for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and those of the Australian Representative. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* This accords with the normal constitutional position of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a selfgoverning territory of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* This broadening of its authority reflects current practice agreed by the previous government and this government that when independence comes there will be no area of government in which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be unfamiliar or lack experience. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Clause 1 1 reflects changes requested by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the composition of the Executive. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* By agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, defence and foreign relations will remain reserved to Australia until independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* However, again in accordance with agreements reached with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, provision has been made for the proclamation at self-government of other functions which it may be necessary to reserve pending completion of any legislative and administrative steps both in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Such functions will be proclaimed only after agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and as soon as the administrative and legislative details have been completed these functions will be transferred to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The High Commissioner's role in the reserved areas will be similar to the Administrator's present role in the government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* As such he will be responsible within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for these functions on behalf of Australia and will be subject to the directions of the Australian Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Nevertheless, in accordance with the policies of the previous government and this Government, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers will be closely and fully involved in the reserved functions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The creation of this portfolio and the appointment to it of a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister will ensure that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have first hand involvement and experience in these key reserved areas, well before independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* In the light of these changes and in response to a request by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, the Bill by clause 23 amends the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act to make provision for the laws of the House of Assembly to be called Acts' rather than 'Ordinances' if the House decides to adopt this nomenclature. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has requested that the qualifications of persons who may be appointed as judges of the Supreme Court be extended. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Amendments under clause 28 will allow lawyers with at least 5 years standing, and judges of courts of unlimited jurisdiction within any legal system similar to that of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be apointed Clause 26 provides forjudges to be appointed on contract for a fixed term. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Such provisions will allow <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to call on overseas expertise for as long as it takes its own legal profession to provide a sufficient number of judges. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* At present all loans raised by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government are guaranteed by Australia by virtue of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* I now turn to the second Bill we are consideringthe <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Application of Laws) Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Honourable senators will be aware that there are a number of Acts of the Australian Parliament which have application in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Some of these Acts apply because the Australian Parliament has expressly extended them to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Other Acts have application insofar as some sections of them apply to people, things or situations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* All these Acts form part of the internal law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* During self-government <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be entitled to have the final say on what laws apply within its boundaries, except of course laws in the reserved areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* Thus the application of those Australian Acts which would be inconsistent with the status of a self-governing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should, so far as practicable, be discontinued. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The only practicable solution is to permit the making of regulations effectively to cease the application to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of Australian Acts. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* It is proposed by this Bill that the GovernorGeneral be empowered to make regulations ceasing the operation of Australian Acts in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The Acts to be dealt with are only those which form part of the internal law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* To avoid the situation whereby the cessation of an Australian Act would leave a vacuum in the law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it is proposed that the application of an Australian Act, particularly for which there is no <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> counterpart, will in general not be discontinued until and unless that cessation has been approved by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* When any Act ceases to apply to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by regulation, the Act will still apply to Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* It may be that some aspects of that Act, as part of Australian law, but no longer as part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> law, will require amendment to protect the rights under Australian law of persons, matters or things connected with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, or to make provision for the occurrence of matters in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affecting Australia but not <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* 
 Mr President, I now turn to the 2 other Bills which affect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- the Wireless Telegraphy Bill and the Meteorology Bill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia have agreed that both Acts should be discontinued in their application to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at a mutually agreed time. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The reasons for this are the enactment by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of a radiocommunications ordinance dealing with matters covered by the Wireless Telegraphy Act and the transfer to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of meteorological functions formerly carried out by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The second stage which will culminate in May or June next year will be the consideration and adoption by the House of Assembly of a Constitution prepared by the Constitutional Planning Committee and the subsequent amendment by this Parliament of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act to make the Act consistent with that Constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* These Bills, the adoption of the Constitution, subsequent amendment of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act next year, and the final step of independence, are all integral stages in the continuous development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from dependency to nationhood.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The Council noted the agreement between the Governments of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that resolutions in the House of Assembly on important constitutional issues will be by a recorded vote and by a substantial majority representative of the nation as a whole.

* On the timing of independence, the Council noted Australia's view that there are 2 elements involved in the determination of the question of independence: The view of Australia, and the views of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as expressed through their elected representatives in the House of Assembly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The Council noted that Australia expects independence to come by 1975, and that it should be achieved in the closest consultation with the Government and the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* The amendment of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act will formalise the self-governing status of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0)

* This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government for overseas borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in foreign currencies not exceeding the equivalent of $A24 million in 1973-74. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* The proceeds of the loans will be used by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to finance public works and services. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* Legislation to authorise the borrowings has already been passed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* The Parliament has also on a number of previous occasions approved similar contractual guarantees by the Australian Government in respect of loans to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* All borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, of course, carry a statutory guarantee by the Australian Government by virtue of section 75A of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* Several loan possibilities on overseas markets are currently being investigated by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* The form of guarantee that is customarily required in international capital markets is similar to those that have been given to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to the Asian Development Bank in respect of borrowings by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those institutions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* The Bill is purposely couched in general terms in respect of the currencies and the precise forms of the proposed borrowings so as not to restrict the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government's choice as to the particular overseas market or markets in which it finally decides to arrange the loans. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* In present circumstances, it is expected that the overall cost of the borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government will be somewhat less than the cost of borrowings for comparable periods form institutional sources in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* The provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government will materially assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in negotiating favourable terms for the borrowings as well as enhancing its status as a borrower on overseas capital markets after it becomes independent. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-70-0)

* At present the Australian Government's legislation, namely, the Reserve Bank Act, the Banking Act and the Commonwealth Banks Act, extends to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and, accordingly, the responsibility for control and supervision of banking in that country rests with the Australian Government and, in particular, with the Reserve Bank of Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* It will also open the way for the development of a banking and financial system appropriate to the particular needs and circumstances of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will ensure control by Papua New Guineans in the planning of future developments in these areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* The report of that committee, which was tabled in the Australian Parliament on 29 August 1973, was accepted in principle by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government as a suitable basis for action to establish a separate banking system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0)

* Since the Australian banking legislation extends at present to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government can bring these ordinances into operation only when the application of the Australian banking legislation to that country is withdrawn.

* The Government will have a certain amount tied up which it has guaranteed, and on any future occasion should the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> want to be an overseas borrower in its right and seek the guarantee of the Australian Government, I would expect that a similar Bill would come forward into the Australian Parliament by which the Government would seek the approval of the members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate to give that guarantee.

* Therefore we could expect that, allowing for changes that inevitably will take place in any system of law in a different country, substantially the system of the English common law will persist there as it has persisted in the United States, and that the guidance, legal knowledge and expertise of Australia will continue to be available to that country, whether in a general sense or through particular practitioners who will move from our jurisdiction to take their places in judicial and professional positions in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* 1 should be concerned if I thought that on the economic front <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was merely to be allowed to run adrift, because that could pose tremendous problems not only for that country but also for us. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Therefore the creation of a central banking system and monetary control disciplines is essential for the economic viability of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* The expertise of the banking institutions of Australia- certainly the public banking institutions and no doubt the private institutions- has been made available and will continue to be made available to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* 1 have not had the opportunity of reading the statement that was made and tabled in August by the Minister as to the consultation between the Commonwealth Bank and the banking authorities in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the emergence of the new banking structure, and I should be obliged if the Minister would be kind enough in his reply to indicate the extent to which there will be continuing consultation between the Australian banking institutions- the banking system- and the new banking system of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> so that the most modern banking techniques will continue to be made available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* If by any chance, due to a lack of knowledge, a lack of ability, a lack of experience, the emerging economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should find itself in a position of economic collapse that would be a tragedy for that nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Therefore, quite apart from our solicitude for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and particularly at this point of time, we have a certain national vested interest that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as it emerges, should be a nation in the full sense of the term economically strong and founded on a proper application of the necessary modern techniques in every area of life to enable it to operate and function efficiently in the interests of its people and to take its place in world affairs, and more particularly to take its place in this area of the world where both it and we have such a common and enduring interest. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Australia, of course, is one of the most highly developed countries, technically, in the world in all areas of life and perhaps it is therefore fortunate for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that this body of knowledge will continue to be made available. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I have little doubt that it will continue to be made available generously and at all times and continually and that it will be a repository of wisdom, experience and knowledge on which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will draw. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* For those reasons I think that at this stage the Senate should register its warm appreciation of the fact that the emergence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is moving into the condition where very practical steps are being taken, where the actual organs of government are being created and where with a nice display of prudence and gradualism the institutions are being created. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I know that there has been criticism in international bodies and throughout the world as to the Australian performance in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Coincident with that we helped to develop <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the point it is at today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* But I think that it is a matter for tremendous pride that in that time, with those setbacks, we created a nation of our own, one of the wealthiest nations of its size in the world and in the process helped to establish the nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to which independence is now coming with the aid and support that we have been able to give it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* My purpose in speaking in this debate this evening is to make a few general comments concerning the transfer to self-government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 1 December this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I do so primarily because I had the privilege of being the only senator who was a member of a delegation from the Australian Parliament to visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in June of this year. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Although it is a fact that many honourable senators have visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from time  to  time and many members of the House of Representatives have done so, this delegation of which I was a member was the first official delegation of the Australian Parliament to visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* That is the date which I and my fellow members of the delegation found that the people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were particularly concentrating upon and, of course, about which they were particularly concerned. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Dealing with the main Bill before us, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill, the one to effect internal self-government on 1 December, I note that it provides very broadly and we have been all led to understand that after 1 December there will be full internal self-government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Apart from that, one would assume that all other powers will be within the competence of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government under its Chief Minister. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I notice that in the debate on this Bill in another place  Mr Andrew  Peacock, the former Minister for External Territories under the previous Government, raised the question of whether internal self-government meant that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government would be entirely responsible for internal security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I would have imagined that if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had internal self-government, then that Government would be the one entirely responsible for internal security. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* But I raise this problem also because I notice in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I wonder what will be the relationship between the GovernorGeneral and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to the recommendation for such appointments. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* As I said, I would assume that certainly the recommendations would come from the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Senator Byrne  seemed to feel that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would maintain a common law system and that the law, as we know it here, will pertain substantially in future in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* From the experience which I gained on my visits to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and from the discussions which I have had from time to time with people who have lived there, it seems to me that there has been a very real criticism in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of the administration of our legal system and of the way in which the Supreme Court operates in our legal system. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* It seems to be fairly broadly accepted that the application of the common law and its technical rules has not been particularly successful in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I believe that the system needs to be watched carefully because the establishment of a village court system, which would apply, as  Senator Byrne  said, local customs in the solution of many problems, may lead to a great fragmentation of the legal system rather than to the provision of a national law which should be the ideal of a new and emerging nation such as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I am not saying that that is proposed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I rose because I was a member of a quite recent parliamentary delegation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* We had a remarkable opportunity to meet diverse elements of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> community. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I think that local councils have been among the great achievements of the Australian administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* It was from our discussions with them that we, I think, were able to appreciate some of the major concerns which face the inhabitants of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as they move towards self government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* The people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are quite satisfied and quite content with the notion of" self government. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I am not saying that it is not our obligation to endeavour to hasten along the processes of independence, but I think it is my duty to express in the national Parliament, having had this opportunity to visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the concern that so many people there feel about this matter. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Nevertheless I think it is our responsibility to keep emphasising this matter to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at every opportunity we have because undoubtedly there was this feeling that once we handed over to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> we, as a nation, would tend to reduce financial assistance or eliminate it entirely. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* This has particular personification in the localisation of positions in the various elements of the public service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will be related to the time for which Australians- expatriates as they are known- continue to remain and work in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* They are very conscious of the importance of the participation of Australians and other expatriates, now and for many years to come, in providing expert services in so many fields of government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Among them are men and women who went there at an early age and who have devoted their lives to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Guinea but also in Australia, among those who take an interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as to what is the Australian Government's policy in relation to independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* So in this respect there is great confusion, not only in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but also in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* We as a Party have taken the view that independence should not be thrust upon <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, that there should be a request to us by a representative body of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which says: 'We are now ready for independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Not only is there concern about independence but also a number of local movements, even secessionist movements, are starting to arise in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* These matters have to be resolved primarily, of course, by the Papua New Guineans themselves, and the decisions have to be made by the only representative body of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, namely, the House of Assembly. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Members of the Labor Party who have this conscience problem about this matter want to unburden <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as quickly as possible. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* We cannot just throw independence at <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before these matters are resolved in some way or other because if we do we will only be leaving the country with a Government which will then be racked by internal civil war. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Select Committee on Constitutional Development which is already sitting and working in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is, I believe, likely to come forward with some proposals in this regard. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* I believe that there will have to be many more of this sort of development before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is fully fit for independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Because after 1 December we as a national parliament will still have responsibility for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>'s foreign affairs and defence and, I think, for a general oversight of the affairs of that nation, we ourselves will have to shoulder some considerable responsibility in determining this vital question of independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* When I first took an interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> I was of the opinion that it needed its independence, but the more I studied the country and the more I went up there the more I realised that it was not yet time for independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* It is all very well to say that we have to give independence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as fast as possible, but when one looks around the country one can see that the people are not ready for it and many do not want it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* They want us to rush into giving independence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because they will be the heads of government in the country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* -Oh, yes, but it is not so good that the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have to conform to our way of doing things and must have a parliament which is totally different in type from that which they are used to. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* For years we have been trying to impose our laws on the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but are our laws any better than theirs? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Certainly they may have made a profit from living there, but without them <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would not be where is is today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* The other problem is that once <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> attains independence it will be a greater financial burden around our necks than it has been in the past because if we do not give assistance to that country the Japanese will. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* A problem will arise because our foreign relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be affected because other countries will be willing to assist it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* What the Japanese could not achieve during the war they will certainly achieve economically in the next few years if we do not be firm in our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Giving <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> independence does not seem to me to be the answer, but it seems the 'in' thing nowadays is that every nation must have its independence whether or not it is ready, and it seems that we have to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

* Because one of the Administrators wanted a job for himself there he decided that a university was needed, so we rushed ahead and founded that university, and the standard was lowered because no one in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could reach matriculation level. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0)

* The Opposition recognises that the Bills clarify a matter of some doubt in one respect and acknowledge the rights of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at this stage, and certainly when it becomes independent, to exercise full and plenary powers over exploration for mining in its off-shore areas. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0)

* The present position in relation to the power to make laws with regard to off-shore mining is that the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act have been exercised in the manner in which, prior to self government last December, the power to make laws was transferred from the Australian Government to the legislature of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0)

* Accepting that when the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent it should have all the powers of a sovereign nation with regard to its off-shore areas, it is appropriate that there be no doubt that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on independence will have that power.

* The amendment to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is designed to carry forward logically and, one might suppose, is a matter of realisation of what was contemplated some 7 years ago, that some day the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would exercise for itself powers with regard to petroleum exploration and exploitation in its off-shore waters. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0)

* It will mean that the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act passed by this Parliament hereafter will contain no reference to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and impliedly will divest all Australian authorities of power to make laws with regard to exploration for and exploitation of petroleum in the off-shore waters.

* The territorial division of the submerged lands area between Queensland and the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was a fundamental part of the arrangement so that the area over which the Commonwealth Government, representing the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, would exercise authority could be differentiated from the area over which the Designated Authority for the State of Queensland would exercise authority.

* I understand, having had some discussions with  Mr Peacock  who represents the Opposition in this matter in the House of Representatives, that the boundary which was drawn in 1967 has undergone some inevitable changes over the years, so that what is now produced in the legislation which is currently before us is a boundary which includes part of the land mass of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0)

* As I have indicated these 2 Bills are part of the ongoing process, with which the Opposition concurs, for the transference of power to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> so that when it assumes independence it will be a full independence in which the co-operation of the Australian Government at all times has been evident.

* But in the course of the discharging of that obligation I think Australia has been well served, as I believe the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have been well served, by the persons who have contributed to the result which is about to emerge on 16 September.

* When one considers the Administrators of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> going back before the present Administrator-  Sir Hubert  Murray,  Sir Donald  Cleland,  Mr David  Hay and  Mr Les  Johnson- one acknowledges that the persons who assumed that position were persons who gave tremendous dedication to that Territory. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* There was a whole host of dedicated Australians, some of whom I have mentioned, and a whole host of dedicated people in the departments, in particular in the Department of the Interior and the Department of External Territories, who gave an enormous amount of their energy and skills to the emerging of selfgovernment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.

* I believe that even after 16 September when independence is granted to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Australia will still have a part to play- maybe in an advisory role- to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be able to continue and prosper as a new nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* I am very proud to be associated with the passage of these Bills, having been one of those persons who have visited the Territory frequently over a period of 30 years, and who has many good friends not only within the Pangu Party but also in other political organisations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* I made the forecast that 1974 would be the last year in which Australia could beneficially affect the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that from 1974 onwards the problem presented by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to Australia would be of an infinitely greater dimension than the problem it had presented in the past 10 years. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* I make this forecast, regretfully and with no pleasure: In the next 10 years <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will present greater problems to Australia than it has presented under the forced draught system by which we have brought it to independence. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* In other words, the new nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which we are ushering into independence in the next fortnight is what I describe as a centrifugal nation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* Members of my Party in the other place complained that Australia was behaving in a mean way towards the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by making sure that the amount required under one of these Bills which relates to the golden handshake, as it is sometimes called, to be given to all the people who served that country for a long time honestly, with great courage and under enormous hardship will be part of the aid program. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* One was that the departure of Australians from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should carry with it the responsibility of the new nation at least to maintain the pensions of the people who had served that country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* The only other option open- there are many illustrations of this- was for Australia itself to ensure that the expatriates who had worked in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> all their lives, some of them having been third generation people, had their pension rights protected. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* What happened, in essence, was that Australia said that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> otherwise would have to pay so many millions of dollars a year towards the pensions of these expatriates; so Australia would pay the pensions and would carry out this obligation which in ethical, commercial and industrial terms <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should accept. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* I think the Government has been perfectly correct in making the Ministry of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> realise that it has an obligation to accept some of the responsibilities of independence; that is, they will have to learn to stand on their own feet and not become a mendicant society.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0)

* He made it quite clear that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can count on continuing to receive substantial amounts of aid from Australia over the next 3 years to underpin its new improvement program and to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the early years after independence.

* The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Termination Bill 1976, which is now before the Senate, consists of 34 clauses, most of which are of a machinery or 'savings' nature to preserve the residual entitlements of personnel when the Australian Staffing Assistance Group is wound up on 30 June 1 976.
