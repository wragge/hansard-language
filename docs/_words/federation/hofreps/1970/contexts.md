[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0)

* Firstly, in the formula customarily used where an Act is regarded as stating the law as it already exists, as well as possibly making new law, the Bill declares and enacts that the sovereignty in the territorial sea is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 5; similarly that the sovereign rights of Australia for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 10; and that sovereignty in the internal waters of Australia, with the important exception of waters that were internal waters of the States at the time of <span class="highlight">federation</span>, and still remain such, is likewise vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clauses 9 and 11, which must be read together. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0)

* At the time of <span class="highlight">federation</span>, the general law was that the baseline of the territorial sea followed around the coast except where it encountered a bay whose width at the entrance was not more than 6 miles, that is, twice the then generally accepted breadth of the territorial sea. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0)

* I believe that the Parents and Friends <span class="highlight">Federation</span> of Victoria has set out sound proposals in this letter and after listening to the various Opposition speakers today neither I nor the electors are quite sure what Labor's policy on education really is. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0)

* The Minister for Education and Science, in presenting the Bill, specifically rejects many of the submissions of the Australian Teachers' <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, and, in so doing, ignored the status of teaching as a profession and its consequential duty to run its own affairs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0)

* Therefore, in rejecting the submission of the Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> that more weight should be given to seniority, the Government is not merely asserting a belief in promotion by merit, but making assumptions about the educational process that educationists would regard as totally unacceptable.

* After a change in office bearers in the New South Wales Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, when objec tions to our speaking directly with the AusSouth Wales Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> had been removed, we did have extensive discussions with that branch, I think to the advantage of both parties as became evident in a Press statement which appeared in the Canberra Times' as a result of the discussions.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-3-0)

* In moving this amendment, I think the Opposition has overlooked the fact that it was provided quite specifically at .the request of the Australian Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> that appeals by teachers or their unions against determinations of the Commissioner go not to the Public Service Arbitrator but to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29)

* He misses the point that it is at the request of the Australian Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> and the teachers themselves that appeals from determinations of the Public Service Board under our proposals or from determinations made by the Commission without the Public Service Board's approval under the Opposition's proposals may be made to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29)

* Alternatively, will this be the position: The representatives of the Australian Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> will go direct to the Public Service Board, rather than have discussions with the Commissioner, in the full knowledge that the Board is an instrument of Government power and policy? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29)

* I repeat that the protection for the teaching profession in this area is the protection which the Australian Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> specifically asked for and with which the Government was happy to agree - it was not a question of granting a request as a decision had not been made in relation to this matter - and that was the right of appeal under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29)

* I asked the Minister whether his Department would, between the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill and consideration of it in Committee, give the matter serious consideration with a view to taking up with the Australian Teachers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, if the criteria are acceptable, whether they could be, as they are in South Australia, incorporated by instruction.

* On 8th November, after further hearings, the Tribunal dismissed the Air Pilots' Guild's claim for an award under Section 41 (1) (d) (i) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, on the grounds that as all pilots employed by Ansett Airlines would in future be covered by the current Pilots' Award, to which the Australian <span class="highlight">Federation</span> of Air Pilots is a party, there remained no grounds for making the Air Pilots' Guild of Australia party to an award.

* At this point I would like to quote what the Executive Director of the Australian Council of Employers Federations,  Mr G.  Polites, said on 14th April 1970. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* 
 Mr Polites, at that time anyway, was the main voice for the Employers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, an organisation whose views carry considerable weight with the Liberal-Country Party Government; an organisation whose members subscribe very largely to Liberal and Country Party funds; an organisation which over the years has done everything within its power to depress workers' wages and prevent improvement in conditions; an organisation which has acted as best it could to deny wage justice to workers in one industry, if such wage justice could perhaps flow on to workers in another industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* What  Mr Polites  was advocating was that if any wage justice exists in this country by way of some democratic system it should be replaced by a system of absolute dictatorship, a dictatorship controlled by a Liberal Government in collaboration with the Employers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, which could stop any further progress by unions towards obtaining a better deal for their members and, in turn, obtaining a fairer share of profits resulting from greater efforts of workers. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0)

* The second step taken by the Government to bring about the situation required by  Mr Polites  and his <span class="highlight">Federation</span> is the Bill now being debated, a Bill containing amendments which, if allowed to he inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, will not, as the Treasurer suggested, give it any additional strength but will in fact weaken it very considerably in relation to the settlement of industrial disputes.

* In the case of a federal state, where for domestic purposes supreme legislative and executive power is divided between the <span class="highlight">federation</span> and its component states or provinces, the question frequently arises whether the control of off-shore resources is exercisable, as a matter of internal constitutional law, by the <span class="highlight">federation</span> itself, or by its component states or provinces, or is shared between both.

* The indulgent nature of these conditions is a salient indication of the extent of the weakness of the employers, vis a vis the bargaining power of the Waterside Worders <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, the degree to which wages and salaries are a major cost factor and the extent to which they have added to our inflationary experience.

* Concessions in wages and conditions of the magnitude which the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> and stevedoring employers - we are critical of both bodies - have negotiated outside the conciliation and arbitration system have posed particular problems in the industry and have added significant burdens to freight costs.

* In addition, idle time costs had to increase because employers, the previous Government through the Department of Labour and National Service and the ASIA had demanded recruitment to the industry, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, against the wishes of the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> and in spite of the fact that everybody foresaw redundancy situations in 1972 in both those ports and in ports such as Newcastle, Port Kembla, Brisbane and Adelaide.

* Essentially the reason is that in the big ports the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority can declare people redundant only if the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour and the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> take the initiative, or it can happen on the recommendation of the AEWL in association, in certain circumstances, with the WWF.

* We pointed out earlier in this debate that the disparity between the various States in representation in the Senate in accordance with the number of people in the States, all States having equal numbers of senators although they have great differences in population, arose from a federal compact and we paid this price as the price of <span class="highlight">federation</span>, lt is not something which we should otherwise willingly have paid but the compact has been made.

* Presently accepted methods of determining State boundaries as used by the Division of National Mapping show the States to have more territory than they had at <span class="highlight">Federation</span> - mainly because of the increased closing distance now used to close off internal waters, and because some areas, such as Wollongong, Portland, etc., have been built up since then.

* So, we see  Mr W.  N.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44)

* Obviously, when the Australian Farmers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> in solemn conference rejects them and rejects their point of view and the newspapers of the nation have such headlines as Country Party is Fooling Fanners' and Farmers Rebuff the Country Party', they are embarrassed because what they have been saying over the last few months to the people in the cities is that the countryside is still in the state of recession it was in when the Government changed.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44)

* There are several points of principle involved, and the Opposition would have liked to move an amendment to this Bill which, while not refusing it a second reading, would have indicated our concern that special provision should have been made for implementing an extended research program into insect infestation of wheat, on the basis outlined by the Minister for Primary Industry to the Australian Agricultural Council and the Australian Wheatgrowers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0)

* What I am seeking from the Minister for Northern Development and the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for Primary Industry, is a firm undertaking that if the Australian Wheatgrowers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> decides that the tax of 11c per tonne is insufficient to meet the needs for which the fund was established, and if it agrees to a higher grower contribution, the Government will match that increased contribution from the industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0)

* The second aspect which should be borne in mind is that the Australian Wheatgrowers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> placed a condition on this program, which made it extremely difficult to initiate.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0)

* It is true that the <span class="highlight">Federation</span> was somewhat divided as to whether it should, firstly, enter the field by making additional funds available and, secondly, enter the actual properties in order to make an investigation. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0)

* However, the Bill makes provision for a figure lower than the 15c, namely 11c, but that rate can be increased to 15c after discussion between the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  and the Australian Wheatgrowers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0)

* The machinery of this situation would be that the Australian Wheatgrowers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> would examine the matter and write a report to the Minister for Primary Industry who would examine the recommendation and then take the matter to the GovernorGeneral.

* It is time the Government not only practised restraint on its own account through the measures I have mentioned through the course of these remarks and established restraint in other sections of the community but also used its links with the Australian Council of Trade Unions to see that the Builders Labourers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> cannot get away with its claimed guerilla tactics, to see that the Amalgamated Metalworkers Union will not be successful- [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0)

* I applaud the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> for it, and I applaud him for applauding it for what it did, because it is sensible in industrial relations to give credit where credit is due and not always take an institutionalised attitude towards things and simply assume that employers are always wrong or always right, and vice versa in respect of the unions.

* With the mechanisation by the ship owners and the many different ways of transporting cargo, people who belonged to unions other than the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> of Australia, were performing tasks which were very similar in nature to those tasks once performed by waterside workers but which, because of the introduction of technology and mechanisation on the waterfront, are now in fact vastly- different tasks. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0)

* Clearly there must be some agreement between the Government, whose job it is to administer these regulations and these laws, and those who will work under them, because if the Government becomes autocratic or if the Opposition, persisting with its amendment, should push the Government into doing something which does not meet with the agreement of the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, then of course there will be immediate conflict.

* Nevertheless, I think it is important to point out that there appears to be strong evidence that national priority should be devoted to forward planning in our port facilities in association with future expectations of trade and to the provision of financial assistance to upgrade those facilities for the benefit of the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> and for the benefit of the Australian people.

* The one solution I keep coming back to is to put all waterside workers, whether they be clerks or members of the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, under the control of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to get some control and discipline in the industry, so that we will not have the problem of locked-up labour and of people being paid for sitting at home doing nothing when other employers are short of labour.
