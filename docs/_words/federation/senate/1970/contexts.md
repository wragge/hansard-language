* I personally have never subscribed to that view knowing of the work they have had to do, but I wonder now on reflection whether people were justified in saying the unkind things they said about the members of the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> in view of the fewer industrial disturbances that have taken place since the industry was organised on a permanent basis.

* On the credit side it is fair to say that the technological changes which have occurred in the stevedoring and shipping industries since  1967  have been achieved with the co-operation of the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-41-0)

* Does any aspect of the present dispute between Qantas and the Australian <span class="highlight">Federation</span> of Air Pilots cover any matter associated with the safety of aircraft operations: If not, and if the present dispute is only industrial matters such as general conditions of work only, why has the dispute not been referred to the Flight Crew Officers' Industrial Tribunal which was specifically established for the purposes of mediating in such disputes.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* The complaint which has been conveyed to me and which may have some basis is that at the present time the <span class="highlight">Federation</span> apparently is controlled mainly by stud breeders of pigs. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* So at that time he saw the <span class="highlight">Federation</span> as being completely autonomous and controlled by commercial pig producers, with the stud side completely out of it immediately the <span class="highlight">Federation</span> was operative. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* I understand that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture felt that the <span class="highlight">Federation</span> fairly represented the Australian pig industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* Indeed, it would seem that the Australian Commercial Pig Producers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> - the Commonwealth body - represents the majority of pig producers throughout Australia although there does appear to be a considerable number in Victoria and some in Queensland who are still associated with the Victorian Farmers Union. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* Clause 9 of the Pig Industry Research Bill provides that the Committee shall consist of 6 persons representing the organisation known as the Australian Commercial Pig Producers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, 2 persons representing the organisation known as the Australian Agricultural Council and various' other persons who are nominated. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* But as the Minister's second reading speech indicates, the representatives of the Commercial Pig Producers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> and of the Australian Agricultural Council will constitute a majority of those persons who will actually administer the functions of the Committee. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* It could be said that the easy way out for the members of that body would be for them to forget their identity and join the Commercial Pig Producers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, thus gaining representation through that federal body which has the major representation on the Committee, but I wonder whether it is right for the Parliament to impose its will to that extent on people who belong to a voluntary organisation within the industry and to penalise that section of the industry by having it not represented on the Research Committee which will administer the industry. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* However, in Victoria and, to a lesser degree, in Queensland some producers object to the Commercial Pig Producers <span class="highlight">Federation</span> and its constitution. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0)

* This prevents complete harmony in the industry and because of that disharmony I think it would be a fairer consideration if some representation had been allowed for in this Bill - although it has not been sought - for those people who are not members of the Commercial Pig Producers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>.

* However, I feel bound to say, as  Senator Willesee  said, that these things happen in a nation the size of Australia, because of budgetary considerations and the fact that we are in a <span class="highlight">federation</span> in which so many variations occur in a financial year.

* Has the Minister seen a statement by the General Manager of the <span class="highlight">Federation</span> of Australian Commercial Television Stations that the collective opinion of the television industry is that no Australian quota should be imposed which cannot reasonably be complied with by every station and that doubts are held by several licensees as to the wisdom of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board's declaring an increase in the quota of dramatic programmes as from next September?

* But at least when we come to a matter such as this and we find that the Commonwealth which has a substantial command of the sources of revenue is in a position to give money to the States on terms, even though as generous as this but on this basis, it highlights the necessity for a complete look at the concept of <span class="highlight">federation</span>.

* This process is surrounded by all the circumscriptions and all the defences that it should have, because the amending of the Constitutionof the written document, the contract and compact of <span class="highlight">Federation</span>- is a sacred arrangement and not likely to be disturbed and certainly not likely to be disturbed by a government electing through control in one House to by-pass the complete legislative process by compelling legislation through the Upper House and then saying to the people that the decision is theirs.

* Insofar as the Constitution is a solemn compact, a solemn contract, in which the States have this most important role, it seems to me to be basic logic that if that instrument is to be subject  to  change and if the States are to have a continuance of their primary significance there must be an overwhelming vote by the States as such for or against any alteration to the compact of <span class="highlight">federation</span>, the Constitution itself. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* It would appear to me to be a departure that if we are not going to insist upon a vote by the majority of States to vary the Constitution but enable the referendum to be passed on an equality of State votes, together with a majority of the aggregate of the people 's votes it will be, to use my original term, a misconception of the very nature of the compact of <span class="highlight">federation</span>. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0)

* It is on that basis that I appeal to honourable senators to give their consideration seriously to this Bill and to see whether there is any element of prudence or wisdom at all or whether there is not such a fundamental change being effected in the provisions of the Constitution by this means that the original concept of <span class="highlight">federation</span> will be lost and destroyed completely.

* It is bound to create enormous hostility among the States, which have come together as a cohesive whole for the benefit of the whole nation and which would  never have come together if it had been suggested at the time of <span class="highlight">Federation</span> that the Commonwealth would take unto itself the power to say to the States what it considers to be a democratic system of election.

* I would say to  Senator Cotton,  if he were in the chamber, that it is another blow for <span class="highlight">federation</span> that a State government cannot even look after the polluting effects of a proposal for its own gulf waters and that the Commonwealth must step in to look after the matter for the State Government.

* I find the Commission's conclusion very helpful indeed, and the one that I have taken as my chief guideline is the one which states that special grants are justified when a State, through financial stress from any cause, is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the <span class="highlight">federation</span> and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0)

* I wonder, if I may just touch on this briefly, why a person whose responsibility ought to be the development of air services in the interests of the members of the Air Pilots <span class="highlight">Federation</span> would be floating the proposition, would be putting into the minds of the community a suggestion that there should be the closing down of an airport and so a reduction in the activity of that industry for which he had at least some responsibility.

* I want to be assured that if that is the intent of this inclusion, as I believe it to be, it is not in any way capable of weakening the exclusion of bulk handling operations from the monopoly of the Waterside Workers <span class="highlight">Federation</span>, and exclusion which I hope is achieved by the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill that we have before us, in conjunction with Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (No. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0)
