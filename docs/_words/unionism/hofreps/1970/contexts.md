* As a member of a trade union and as an active member of a trade union before I came to this place, all I can say to honourable members is this: From my experience of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> the trade unionist was able to get increased wages and better conditions only if he was prepared to take action and to struggle for them.

* Lance Sharkey, the then National Secretary of the Communist Party, in his book 'The Trade Unions', made it clear that the purpose is not primarily to bring about economies of scale and an increase of power in industrial relations, but rather to increase the political power of unions as revolutionary weapons - an objective which ought to be alien to trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and which is essentially political and subversive in character.

* Surely it is a little unreasonable for the Government to pursue a policy of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> because, let us face it, in the political situation in which we find ourselves - and I do not object to this - funds from the unions go towards assisting the Labor Party to gain the Treasury bench or to assist the Labor Party in the political field.

* Prior to the introduction of this Bill the Government, in the view of the Opposition, deliberately sought to dishonour an election promise; to introduce the concept and application of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> into the Public Service; to interfere with the longstanding independence and integrity of the Public Service Board; to avoid parliamentary approval of its policy and to set in motion the beginning of its long term design to use the Public Service as a pace-setter in the achievement of the Australian Labor Party's industrial objectives.
