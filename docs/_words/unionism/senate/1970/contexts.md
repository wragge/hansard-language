* I think it is interesting to see this development in the high priest of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia because, if the industrial power was to be utilised in the way it was threatened to be utilised, it would have had the effect of depriving those who were employed by the companies in the Dunlop group of the work and wages on which they were dependent.
