*  The Senate may or may not recall that I last spoke on this measure on Thursday, 7th May, and when the sitting was suspended at 5.45 p.m., for the dinner adjournment, I was arguing that one of the fundamental differences in the approach to death duties or estate duties - call them what you wish - between honourable senators who sit on this side of the chamber and the members of the Australian Labor Party who sit on the other is their approach to whether or not a <span class="highlight">man</span>, through thrift and initiative in his own lifetime, should be able to acquire an estate or to acquire assets and to pass them on to his beneficiaries, be they his wife or his children.

* Again a <span class="highlight">man</span>'s dependants may find it necessary to buy a bit more property, to increase the size of the existing property so that it becomes an economic unit, but because of the financial commitments, such as the liability of estate duties, they are unable to purchase any additional property and so they do not have an economic unit.

* So in many instances today we have the position, particularly with a downturn in income and a downturn in land values, where, because a <span class="highlight">man</span> died 2 years ago - prior to the imposition of wheat quotas, to use an example - his family is paying death duties which are based on the inflated price of land.

* If it is the fact - a fact which has escaped my scrutiny - that  Mr Justice  Smithers was invited to undertake an inquiry 3 days before the actual publication of the statutory rules, that would indicate to me only the eagerness of the Minister to have the earliest judicial determination which a judge could give, strictly in accordance with court process, on whether this <span class="highlight">man</span> who was lingering in prison for some 11 months was  considerd by the judge to be a conscientious objector.

* Then there are complaints because in our integrated society he finds himself living at a much lower level than the level he aspires to and certainly at a much lower level than a more practical person who accepts his primary responsibility to fit in with the scheme of requirements, not only of his own desires, but also of the desires and needs of his fellow <span class="highlight">man</span>.

* I know that it is necessary for each of us to earn his or her living, but if we make the dollar, as some of the remarks to which we listened might imply, the sole criterion of our pattern in life, we will miss a lot of the beauty of life because <span class="highlight">man</span> does not live bv bread alone.

* We have derived other revenues from current expenses but with regard to probate we have what is virtually a deferred capital gains tax lodged under appalling circumstances at the time of a <span class="highlight">man</span>'s death, which can, as it was in the case to which I referred, be an intolerable burden upon those involved.

* The <span class="highlight">man</span>'s case
            history is that after the drought of 1967 he was forced out of the dairy industry, not

* Originally the basic wage was viewed as a social wage which was sufficient to meet the heeds of a <span class="highlight">man</span>, his wife and  3  children, but following the basic wage inquiry in  1934  the Commonwealth Arbitration Court veered away from this earlier concept of the basic wage as a social wage and decided that it should become an economic wage which would be the highest wage that the court deemed that industry was able to pay.

* I have gone on record before as saying this: The 2 greatest things that can be done in relation to this problem in the wider sense are, firstly, in parallel with the Academy of Science presently existing, to set up an academy of human science and, secondly, to recognise that it is high time we drew together all the discipline of <span class="highlight">man</span>.

* Having said that, as a third plank, I draw attention to the fact - again, honourable senators have heard me say this here before - that the characteristic of human morbidity and of human sickness in the past 50 years has been the growth of illness which has been psychosomatic in its causation, that is.

* I simply say that any <span class="highlight">man</span> who is put off by a cost of 0.45 cents a night is simply not serious, any more than the bringing of this measure before the Senate is a serious attempt to improve the economic structure of our taxation system.

* But if we take the average throughout the community in the various areas of lending today - certainly in the past few years - the expansion of a second group of institutions into banking and thereby into housing has meant that, depending on the skill and ability of the finance seeker and perhaps the demands on finance available for housing, we see a rate of interest of anywhere between 4i per cent and 8i per cent being charged to home builders.

* While there is a schedule of offences for which they may be returned, they insist - I think it is a reasonable proposition - that evidence can be manufactured, that it would be very difficult for a <span class="highlight">man</span> who has come to this country from a country abroad to obtain persons to give evidence in those countries if it is against the wishes of the particular government that he do so.

* However, I have the gravest reservations about taking action which can in any way enable a communist country under the guise of seeking to prosecute a <span class="highlight">man</span> for one of the crimes set out in the schedule, a communist country which can manufacture the evidence without the least difficulty and can then put the <span class="highlight">man</span> in this country, who has to face up to that evidence, in the position that he has nobody in this country to whom he can turn as a witness and he will be unable to find any witness to appear for him in the communist country because the people there will be afraid of the government.

* They propose that a <span class="highlight">man</span>, who considered it was his duty and who still considers it to be his duty to stamp out terrorism in this country, should undergo 3 weeks of intensive cross-examination in the Senate on his actions, then be censured by a motion of the Senate and then go through the same, process before a judicial court of inquiry which would, I assume, be asked to examine the same facts as have been investigated by the Opposition in the Senate and upon which it has already passed judgment.

* How many times must the Attorney-General stand up and be counted when he has shown that he is not complacent about law and order - a phrase that we heard so often from the Opposition in the time that it was in government - and who is determined to seek information which he, as a senior Minister of the Crown, is entitled to receive and which, having regard to his important and responsible position, he has a duty to acquire and then act upon?

* I can think of only one explanation for the volume of complaints which have been registered in this chamber during the past 2i weeks, and that is the old principle of human behaviour that when a <span class="highlight">man</span> feels doubtful or guilty about his behaviour in the past his condemnation will be the loudest condemnation of others who draw his doubt and guilt to his attention.

* I seriously suggest to honourable senators opposite who have been so censorious and, I think, self-righteous and very intolerant of a very tolerant AttorneyGeneral - a <span class="highlight">man</span> who as leader of the Opposition in the Senate adopted a highly responsible and impersonal attitude towards his task and a <span class="highlight">man</span> who since he has been in the office of Attorney-General has acted with great responsibility - that they should really examine their consciences and put themselves in his position in the week before  Mr Bijedic  was due to arrive in this country.

* The final comment is the throw-away line which quite deliberately  Mr Whitlam  ascribed  Mr Lee  Kuan Yew on the same David Frost television performance when he made Australia's affairs, from our security organisation to our international relationships, a matter of vaudeville because he said - think of the import of the accusation - that  Mr Lee,  the Prime Minister of Singapore, becomes more and more like Cromwell.

* I imagine that it was the same attitude as was found by the Prime Minister when he went to Mexico, and as he finds when he goes to many countries, namely, that if you are objecting to atmospheric nuclear testing - that is a sound and proper basis for all persons thinking of the future of mankind in this world to have as the ground of their objection - you do not single out one country and ignore another in the type of objection you are making. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0)

* The simple fact is that if this Government were, like the Opposition, sincere in believing that atomic testing is damaging to humanity wherever it occurs, it would realise quite clearly that tens of millions - nay, hundreds of millions - of Chinese near Lop Nor in the Sinkiang Province and the Chinese and Russians around them are in numbers far more greatly subjected to danger to their lives than those said to be affected by the Mururoa Atoll tests.

* When one reads the case it is very difficult to say that that <span class="highlight">man</span> should have been treated as a traitor to the United Kingdom because in fact he had made a decision and had said: 'Look, I am not on their side, I am on the other side.' [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47)

* But when it can be clearly shown that a person has been a traitor to his country, has put his country in jeopardy and has placed the lives of many people in jeopardy, and perhaps caused the deaths of many people, then I think there ought to be no alternative to his paying the full price for his treachery.

* To go back to the argument of the Opposition, 1 believe that the crime of treason does not automatically require the life of the person who has committed the treason to be taken, but we should retain on the statute books a provision so that the judiciary which is appointed by the Parliament of this country will be able to judge a <span class="highlight">man</span> for his crime and, eventually, perhaps, call on him to forgo his life.

* It is being gradually recognised that the threats that are being engendered, aided by the most modern methods and mechanisms that <span class="highlight">man</span> has devised including the development of instruments of violence and opportunities for <span class="highlight">man</span> under the influence of stimulants to commit violence are such that a Parliament that today persistently proceeds, just because of an ideological idea that it has a conviction that there should be no capital punishment, is, I believe, blind completely to the destructive threats that are evident in our community.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-1)

* In many respects Norman Kirk can be regarded as a <span class="highlight">man</span> who was a model social democrat, a <span class="highlight">man</span> who stood for parliamentary democracy, for orderly processes of law at the same time coupled with the alleviation of the conditions of the people of his country and of other countries with which his country came into association, not by warlike, aggressive or belligerent actions but by cooperation and by entering into a peaceful social contract.

* The young <span class="highlight">man</span> had come here on a cultural exchange, and he expressed his wish to go home and wanted to go home but people were stopping him. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0)

* He withheld information as to why he decided that a young <span class="highlight">man</span> who had expressed a desire to remain in Australia should be taken out of Australia before the courts had an opportunity to consider whether he did in fact want to remain in this country. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* If at that conference with the Department of Labor and Immigration this young <span class="highlight">man</span> said that he wanted to remain in this country and he indicated that he was prepared to take the steps to apply for permission to remain in this country, why did the Minister not inform the Parliament of that fact during the week we were asking him questions? [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* If the account indicates that the young <span class="highlight">man</span> did not wish to remain in Australia of course it verifies entirely what the Minister has said, and 1 suppose it helps the young <span class="highlight">man</span>'s own case with his own governmental authorities. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* But I would have thought that if there were a spark of concern for human rights and liberty that undertaking would have been given. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* If, in fact, at the end of that 24 hour period it was apparent that the young <span class="highlight">man</span> had decided to go back to Russia- there may have been some who would have had their doubts- the processes which we accept would have been utilised in order to have that issue decided. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* There have, of course, been questions as to whether this <span class="highlight">man</span> did in fact evince a desire to remain in Australia. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* That application was supported by affidavits- an affidavit by  Mr Badger,  who related what Ermolenko had told him; an affidavit by  Mr Johnson,  who related what  Mr Ermolenko  had told him; and an affidavit by a lady, Judith Berry Bateman. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* I believe that the worst feature of a shameful week was the fact that within 24 hours of the court being asked to decide the fundamental question of whether or not there was a prima facie case that this <span class="highlight">man</span> was being held against his will- there were indications both ways- the Minister so organised Ermolenko 's departure that the court was not able to decide that fundamental issue. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* That interpreter expressed the view that he was not speaking his mind because he was under the influence of the Russian who was in the room; that Ermolenko appeared to be deferring to that <span class="highlight">man</span>.

* On the afternoon I flew Ermolenko out we had a telephone call from the <span class="highlight">man</span> second in charge of the the airport in Perth asking us what the situation was because he was frankly worried about the ugliness of the crowd there. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* Mr Garland  is the <span class="highlight">man</span> who has been very proud of the part he played in it. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* Here was a young <span class="highlight">man</span> who had come here not as a KGB agent and not as a spy. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* We could have acceded to what they wanted us to do, which was evidently to arrest Ermolenko and take him to a safe place of detention against the <span class="highlight">man</span>'s wishes. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* -All I say about the Ermolenko affair is that the socalled explanation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willessee)  has left as many questions unanswered as answered. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* I think it is very unfortunate that the Minister referred to the people at the Perth airport as a mob of louts because among that 'mob of louts' were many unionists- members of the Transport Workers Union- many university students whose allegiance, I understand, in some cases is to the Australian Labor Party, and many other people of goodwill. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* It was a shambles from the very moment that this young <span class="highlight">man</span> asked to remain in Australia and was allowed to be placed in the hands of the Russians. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* It must have been a very agonising time for him to try to determine what was in the mind of a young <span class="highlight">man</span> of 18 years who had expressed himself one way on one occasion and the other way consistently on other occasions. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* The one thing which I should do at the beginning- and I must say that I feel constrained to do it- is to congratulate the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Greenwood)  on the very fine feelings for human rights and civil liberties to which he has so recently been converted. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1)

* I find it very interesting that  Senator Greenwood,  who sent in the Commonwealth Police to arrest demonstrators at the Melbourne University, and who sent the Commonwealth Police to investigate and interrogate members of this Parliament for exercising this freedom of speech which he believes is so essential in the Soviet Union but which at least in the past he did not think was of any value in this country, has today emerged as the champion of human rights, the champion of civil liberties and the <span class="highlight">man</span> who says that a person should be able to get up and say what he likes whenever he wants to say it and that he should not be interrogated by the police, that he should be free to insert advertisements in newspapers and should be free to demonstrate at the Melbourne University or at the Perth airport or anywhere else.

* He is so sensitive, he gave such an earnest example of it when he was AttorneyGeneral, that because we do not want to upset this <span class="highlight">man</span>'s delicate sensibilities we are going to place  Mr Ermolenko  under arrest and compel him, whether he wants to or not, to spend 24 hours in the company of the Reverend  Mr Johnson  and/or the Reverend  Mr Borthwick,  and then we will have another look at it after he has discussed these matters with these clerical gentlemen.

* It would have been wonderful': He said in that part of his speech how important it would have been for this young <span class="highlight">man</span> to have been got away from the Russian diplomats and be given a chance to be free from them to make up his mind.

* Solzhenitsyn's books are today vivid testimony of the fact that if a <span class="highlight">man</span> or a free nation is condemned to captivity under such a country, they are condemned to a likelihood of a kind of captivity, a kind of torture, including bloody murder, the like of which in our lifetime we have not seen.

* So 1 put it, as a very practical matter, that the Camp Hill site should commend itself to members of the Senate for the very reasons which I have expressed, namely, that it can be the site for a building which is related physically to this building and with which there can be a natural human ebb and flow.

* It might be argued that a woman who has made such sacrifices as I have just suggested in the interests of the marriage would be entitled to a level of maintenance that would take into account not merely the standard of living which the couple enjoyed at the time the marriage broke down but also the fact that the efforts of such a woman have made it possible for such a <span class="highlight">man</span> to enjoy a standard of life considerably higher than they had during the marriage.

* In a recent case in Tasmania a judge held that because there was no definition of 'habitual drunkenness' in the present legislation the proper course to take was to apply the common law rules, and that he could not grant a petition in the case of a person who was habitually drunk but was not violent in association with his drunkenness.

* Although today there is talk about changes in marriage- I believe that there are quite significant changes in the relationships in marriage, and  Senator Webster  spoke about that this afternoonnevertheless, I still believe that the view of marriage in our society, whether it is regarded as a Christian society or not, is still basically the Christian view, and that is the voluntary union of a <span class="highlight">man</span> and a woman for their joint lives to the exclusion of all others.

* The incredible network of personal and social responsibilities which derive from the mere fact of a <span class="highlight">man</span> and a woman joining their lives together for any reasonable length of time necessitates a legal institution to protect those rights and to enforce the duties which undoubtedly flow from a marriage.

* Without going through all the argument again I suggest that the judgment that honourable senators have to make- and, when the Bill is disposed of here, that members of the other place will have to make- is whether that in itself is a complete and absolute ground for dissolution of marriage, which marriage has been carried out in good faith between one woman and one <span class="highlight">man</span> on the basis of a contract for life.

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42)

* That is to say, the substantive part of the Bill was designed to increase the charge from $1.50 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour of waterfront labour employed to $2.50 an hour. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42)

* I note that when the Bill was before the Senate earlier this year it proposed to increase the charges levied on the employers of waterside labour in the case of regular and permanent ports- A class ports- from $1.50 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour, which is the existing rate, to $2.50 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour, in the case of B class ports from $1.75 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour to $3.50 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour; and in the case of C class ports from $1.20 to $2.50. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42)

* The Government's proposition in June was to increase the tax from $2.50 to $4 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour in one grade, from $3.50 to $5 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour in another grade, and from $1.75 to $2.50 in another grade, but it now proposes to increase that last figure I mentioned to $3. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42)

* That charge in relation to a waterside worker in the second grade, where a charge of up to $5 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour is attracted to his employer, on the 33 hours a week worked last year would be the equivalent of a tax of $ 1 65 per <span class="highlight">man</span> per week on the waterfront. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42)

* I went along with the Bill in June, expressing only my opposition but not putting the matter to a vote, but when the Government gets to the stage of taxing waterfront labour in the four or five Tasmanian ports at rates ranging from $4 to $5 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour and we realise that the money goes into the cost of Tasmanian exports and imports, I am bound, unless I am sent here to misrepresent Tasmanian exporters and importers, to cast my vote against this Bill.

* Taking the official statement of the performance of this industry from the annual report of the Stevedoring Industry Authority, the government authority, up until June 1974- there is not a later report- it can be seen that the average working hours per week were 33 hours. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42)

* I know that whatever the information is, the charge is sufficiently huge on the industry- even on the charges that we authorised in June, when we authorised a charge of $3.50 per <span class="highlight">man</span> hour, which is now to go to $5.00- to indicate to me that it is a completely unjustifiable charge and exaction to be imposed on the trade.

* This rampant destruction of our culture, and the socio-economic evils which followed are now indelibly and shamefully inked on the pages of history for all generations to see, a lasting monument to Australian <span class="highlight">man</span>'s inhumanity to <span class="highlight">man</span>.

* As our culture was systematically destroyed and the tribal laws and customs which had sustained us for aeons were deliberately eroded, my forefathers were subjected to the white <span class="highlight">man</span>'s law, laws which were incomprehensible to them and which, in many incidents, were in complete contrast to those which had formerly nurtured them.

* The white <span class="highlight">man</span>'s law had evolved from custom- European custom- tailored to meet the requirements of the European civilisation and, I stress, a European civilisation that in no single way faintly resembled those codes of conduct which were socially acceptable to my ancestors and to their mode and style of living.

* Let me make it quite clear that when I criticise the  Chairman  of the ABC I do so in this context: I share his view expressed to the Prime Minister earlier this year that he was not cut out for the job. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* In other words, he is crystallising this matter by saying that the whole threat to the independence, the integrity and the high repute of the Australian national broadcasting service rests on the appointment of the new  Chairman. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* It is a pretty poor reflection on all the other commissioners whom the Labor Party appointed that one <span class="highlight">man</span> and one <span class="highlight">man</span>'s ideas can outride the others. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* The past takes on a saintly attitude when he recites one by one the 3 1 post-war years and suggests that never before have there been in public any incidents, any trouble about the ABC, any queries on programs, any queries about the action of a commissioner or of a  chairman  of the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* I recall a very great Labor <span class="highlight">man</span> of the past- Albert Monk- one of the great Australians, eminent in his generation and any other, saying repeatedly what a great <span class="highlight">man</span> was  Sir Henry  Bland. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

[[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* Unlike  Senator Button, Mr Monk-  a former and great Labor <span class="highlight">man</span>- had the highest regard for the eminent capacity of the <span class="highlight">man</span> whom honourable senators opposite are attempting to vilify today. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* While  Senator Carrick  referred to a statement by  Sir Henry  Bland that the action taken by him was taken after consultation with senior management and after discussion with all commissioners, 1 note that  Senator Carrick  did not say that  Sir Henry  Bland said that his action was taken with the approval of senior management and with the concurrence of all commissioners. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* What  Sir Henry  Bland as  Chairman  of the Commission did was determine between meetings of the Commission that a series of episodes of a program that had previously been screened were to be taken off the air until further notice. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* There will always be controversy about censorship and, as  Senator Carrick  pointed out, not just censorship by the ABC in all the many forms that that can take, but censorship by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board of the commercial broadcasters and not of the ABC. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* But the hysterical approach of personal attack on a <span class="highlight">man</span> who cannot answer for himself in here is no sort of debate. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* Apparently  Senator Carrick  has still not deduced that one of the major complaints of the Labor Party is about the very fact that the ABC, under its present  Chairman,  is currently under one-<span class="highlight">man</span> rule. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* Certainly, no one would accuse  Sir Henry  Bland, the <span class="highlight">man</span> appointed by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to head the ABC and to clean it up, as  Senator Withers  puts it, of being insensitive to political thought and action.

* He had some arguments about the budget of the Commission but he then went on to say that the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission,  Sir Henry  Bland, had himself defended the Commission after cuts were made. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* He went on to devote most of his time to an attack not on the Government but on  Sir Henry  Bland himself, a <span class="highlight">man</span> who has been an eminent public servant and a <span class="highlight">man</span> who only recently took over as  Chairman  of the ABC. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* He put the point of view that because  Sir Henry  Bland had spent much of his life in the Public Service he was disqualified in some way from serving as  Chairman  of the ABC. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* This attack has been an attack for the jugular vein, not the jugular vein of this Government or of the Commission but that of the  Chairman  of the Commission. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* We do not think it proper for the Australian Labor Party and for senators like  Senator Justin  O'Byrne to speak in the Senate and to attempt to denigrate this <span class="highlight">man</span> or to attempt to intimidate or to indicate to other commissioners how they should or should not act when in due course they hold their meeting and make their decisions on the affairs of the Commission.

* In addition,  Senator Button  did not quite have the courage to go on, although he did tend to refer to  Sir Henry  Bland's fine public record in this community over many, many years as perhaps a past which was a fable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* But he did not proceed so far as did courageous senators like  Senator Walsh  and  Senator Ryan  who attacked and derogated from the actual public performance as a public servant of this <span class="highlight">man</span> who has served his country for many years on a public platform where things were known, where activities were known by the people and where in fact those activities were judged to be suitable and desirable. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* Senator Walsh  was concerned because we criticised his abuse of privilege in this House- the fact that he was as determined as his other colleagues to attack the  Chairman  of the ABC who, of course, could not at this time or in this place in any way answer those criticisms. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* This did not stop him from calling the  Chairman  of the ABC an  ipso facto  dictator of the ABC who was put there to stifle criticism. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* It must get over the idea that everything is done for a sinister reason and that someone who is appointed to such a position as this- a <span class="highlight">man</span> who has been an eminent public servant, who has served his country well and who has been on companies and on boards- is appointed only for a sinister purpose. [[More&hellip;]](https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0)

* Far from facing up to the fact that it represents an admission of failure of all the policies of this Government which was going to turn on the lights, it blames Labor collectively, it blames Labor individually and it suggests that somehow or other a <span class="highlight">man</span>, who had ceased to be Treasurer and was not exercising any fiscal power in this country, by predicting devaluation was in some way to blame for the present position.
