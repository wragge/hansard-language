* Although obviously the most serious and most disastrous thing that could happen to the world would be a third world war, particularly a nuclear war, at the same time it would be a rather grim prospect for the people of the world if the consequence of the relaxation were to mean that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was free to send its tanks into Czechoslovakia and the United States of America was free to send its marines into the Dominican Republic.

* Both the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States have a rather dismal record over the past 20 years of interventions and invasions in other peoples' countries and of efforts to impose their form of economic system and their domination on other countries- the United States of America in South East Asia and Latin America, and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in Eastern Europe.

* This matter was raised by members of the Australian Labor Party because they believed that there had been very clear instances in the past of deprivation of civil liberties by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and because they believed, in the light of the statements which reportedly had been made by and apparently correctly recorded of  Mr Ermolenko  to various people in Perth- the Sub- Warden of St George's College and a prominent figure in the musical life of Victoria who happened to be in Perth and whose name I think is  Mr Badger-that  he had expressed some reluctance to go back to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>.
