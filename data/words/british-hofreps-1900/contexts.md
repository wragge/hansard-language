* Honorable member after honorable member has pointed out, during this debate, that there is no more compulsion in this measure than there is in the numberless Acts operating throughout the **British** dominions, which deal with the regulation of labour, which prescribe conditions, which sometimes prohibit the employment .of women and children, and, in some cases, of men in certain avocations ; which settle the conditions under which mines shall be worked and ships shall go to sea, and in a vast variety of ways refuse to leave to the uncontrolled play of selfish and antagonistic forces the fate of individuals or the future of the State.

* This is one of the strong arguments in favour of our continuing to rely upon the protection of the **British** navy in a somewhat better form than we have had it in the past.

* True, we have had our strikes and our industrial troubles, but if we take that long, rugged road to which the honorable member for South Australia,  Mr. Poynton,  referred, and consider the peaceful triumphs of argument and conciliation, which have been won without any legislative coercion, I say they constitute a great triumph for the **British** people of this country.

* We have been told over and over again by honorable members supporting the Tariff that **British** agricultural industries, manufactures, and exports have been declining and that Britain's choicest population has been departing to other lands where more favorable conditions prevail.

Still, it is an anomaly that persons not charged with fraud, or with an attempt to defraud, may be liable to penalties which, if they cannot pay them', may bring upon them a year's imprisonment, upon the mere allegation of a Customs officer that they have been guilty of offences under certain sections of this Act, unless they can disprove the charges made against them There may be some extraordinary necessity which requires this, but if there is any extraordinary necessity to except the ordinary rules of justice in **British** communities, one would think it would be levelled more against those who are suspected of fraud than against those who are charged with other offences, which may be more or less innocent, against the provisions of this Bill.

* In New South Wales, feeling then ran very high, and since the days of the agitation to prevent that Slate from being any further used as a dumping-ground for **British** convicts, there has been no statesman to whom the citizens were more indebted than they were to the late  Sir Henry  Parkes for the action which he took on that occasion.

* In London I saw a population of 100,000 in one of the best neighbourhoods served, in two grocers' shops, used as telegraph, telephone, and post-offices by two girls and a man, to whom the **British** Postal department paid a certain price for providing most excellent facilities.

* In an article recently published in the Melbourne   Age,  reference was made to the fact that  Sir Harry  Brackenbury, the Superintendent of the Woolwich Arsenal, in giving evidence before the Commission appointed to inquire into the conduct of the war in South Africa, stated that if Great Britain had been engaged in naval warfare at the time of the South African war, a serious crisis would have arisen, and that the resources of the **British** arsenals would not have been equal to supplying all the requirements of the Army and Navy.

* censorship which is out of harmony with the practice observed throughout the **British** Dominions.

* The Bill has been framed very largely upon American precedents, and we find that whereas in most **British** communities Parliament has hitherto been the sole custodian of the Constitution and of the rights of the people under it, it is proposed now to delegate these functions to the High Court.

* Throughout the **British** Dominions there has been one custom.

* We recently had a harrowing picture drawn by the honorable member of the conditions under which **British** settlers are living in the New Hebrides and other Pacific Islands.

* That idea is passing away, even in the **British** Empire, made up of many races, following many different systems of life, with widely divergent religious beliefs, who are able to unite for the purposes of maintaining and extending that Empire.

* That ideal, however, is not, in my opinion, founded on practical experience, and I am afraid that what the Prime Minister expects will not be realized, not be cause the people of Australia are not as patriotic as other **British** people, but because we know that similar proposals have not been adopted by the Mother Country, where the necessity is certainly far greater than here, and because we feel that such a scheme is not necessary at this stage of our existence.

* The **British** Parliament compels the railway companies to provide what, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, is a due and sufficient proportion of accommodation at fares not exceeding id.

* I think that the **British** and Australian system of choosing Judges is incomparably superior to that which has been pursued for many years in many of the United States of America - a method which, as its application has been diminished from year to year, with consequent improvements, has shown the unwisdom of that system as compared with ours.

* In the first place, we have attracted the attention, not only of the **British** Empire, but of the whole world by the position we have taken up in connexion with the South African war, and the people of Great Britain and otherswho come from all parts of the world will desire to show their approval of the step we took in the defence of the Empire.

* The right honorable member for Tasmania,  Sir Edward  Braddon, objects to this extension of the franchise for the simple reason that in all the **British** Empire only two States of Australia  have accepted the principle.

* As far as I can ascertain, it has no parallel in the history of **British** Parliaments.

* I hold as a matter of statesmanship, if I may use the word, that there could not be a greater calamity to the **British** Empire than the creation of another federation in the Pacific.

* Passing from the legal aspect, I may say that I have recently had my attention called to the circumstance, no doubt familiar to most honorable members, that in all those parts of the **British** Empire in which public officers have to perform their duties in tropical or sub-tropical latitudes, special provisions are made for leave.

* Why should we who are **British** do anything to cause a feeling of animosity or distrust to arise in the minds of the people of these two races who are our natural friends against our enemy, Russia ?

* The solidarity of the **British** Empire has always been one of our proudest boasts, and it will, I trust, always remain- one of our greatest glories.

Last year about 42 tons of unginned cotton was grown in Queensland and handled by the Government.

* per lb., and not ijd., and is an improvement on that made by the **British** Cotton Growers' Association.

* I merely say that that circumstance alone points to the right honorable gentleman in his speeches in London having played the hypocrite to a nicety before the **British** people.

* He, apparently, forgot that section 81 is a general provision which is to be found in the constitutions of all **British** countries.

* Here is another instance in which a duty is largely increased mainly against **British** imports.

* I believe that up to the present the mind of the right honorable member has been shaped in regard to this question very much as mine has - that is to say, that he believes with me that the best "method is to proceed along the old time-worn tracks, and adopt the new Tariff by a resolution of this House - to adopt it as it always has been, not only in the **British** House of Commons, but, I believe, in every State of the Commonwealth.

* The South **British** Company, which has its head office in Auckland, in 1901 had a capital of 64,628, and its reserves amounted to 140,000.

* Any one looking at the papers in this case would find it difficult to believe that we are living under **British** rule.

* I think I am correct in saying that there is not a mountain in the **British** Isles over 5,000 feet in height.

* Notwithstanding, the startling figures we have heard, showing the enormous prosperity of Great Britain, and notwithstanding the fact that **British** trade exceeds the trade of the three great nations of France, Germany and the United States of America, these latter are making proportionately gigantic strides, and we must be prepared to meet the situation.

* I should look upon a person who qualified under this Act to receive a pension as being just as fully entitled to it as is a CommanderinChief of the **British** Forces, or the Chief Justice of Great Britain, or of any other part of the Empire, to receive a pension under any other system.

* **British** brandy varies in price from 4s.

* As the name of the late  Sir Henry  Parkes has been mentioned, I may say that the Parliament with which he was associated worthily upheld the best traditions of **British** parliamentary institutions, and it is to be regretted that he was not here to take his place as the leader of the first Commonwealth Parliament.

* But immediately the Johannesburg mines were opened up, **British** and American capital swept into them, and I venture to say that a very short time afterwards the machinery out here was as out of date for gold saving as are horse trams for traction in every civilized place in the world, except Adelaide.

* In transactions between different merchants, if an overcharge is made by one to another, there is no part of the **British** Empire where that is treated as a crime and the man is taken into a court.

* I do not anticipate that the **British** Government would offer any objection to a treaty being entered into by us on these lines.

* We can all imagine what the **British** people would think if Westminster Abbey were to crumble away, as  Sir W.  B. Richmond says it is doing in part.

* No decision has yet been reached, but the Government, by the circulation of publications prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician, by newspaper advertising, and the purchase of a number of special issues of suitable periodicals, are helping to keep the Commonwealth before the eyes of the **British** public.

* I especially commend to those who have not seen them, a series of articles which recently appeared in the'  **British** Weekly,  in which is set out the very latest word on Socialism and Collectivism.

* And Japan, a little while ago, followed the example set by Germany, and imported **British** and American workmen with the same object in view.

* We have seen, with some
            regret, in connexion with the **British** Military department, the spectacle of a squabble
            between the late Commander-in-Chief of the army and the political heads of the War
            Office in Parliament, as to who is responsible for all the mistakes which have occurred
            lately.

* This is enough to make one feel that the Commonwealth is being betrayed in a manner unknown in our time in any other **British** community.

* The death rate in such institutions is enormous; but in the Waitara Home, a little outsideof Sydney, and in a lesser degree in a similar institution near Melbourne, we havethe finest institution of its kind under the **British** flag- an institution which offers to a mother carrying a child a home for three months prior to its birth, and for six months subsequently, thereby promoting the ties of affection.

* He suggested, I think, that preferences might be granted by reducing duties in favour of products imported from **British** Possessions.

* We know how uncertain it is where the **British** Fleet would be stationed in time of war, and certainly Australia should be in a position to prevent its ports being blockaded or bombarded, or its commerce destroyed by perhaps one or two comparatively insignificant cruisers.

* It appears to me strange that the **British** are the only people among whom the undertakers' trade flourishes, and I therefore suggest to the Labour Party that it might be an excellent thing for them to advocate the nationalization of the burying industry.

* But in the future, if we are to have a truly efficient and comprehensive defence schemer, she will be a power, within the **British** power," well worth considering.

* It is quite true that the islands are outside of what is known as Queensland ; still they were annexed by the **British** Crown, and, by virtue of the Imperial Act, they have been proclaimed and are under the control of Queensland.

* The difference between the 25 per cent, duty which was charged under the old Tariff and the 40 ' per cent, which it is proposed to levy -upon **British** goods under this Tariff will represent an increase, not of 15 per cent., out of ,29 5s.

* I do not know of any representative in London of any of the **British** Dominions who is so well paid as we propose to pay our High Commissioner.

* The time of journey from Brindisi to Adelaide is to be reduced to 638 hours, or fifty-eight hours less than is required by the present contract, and from Adelaide to Brindisi to 650 hours, both periods being the same as are provided for in the latest contract between the **British** Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company.

* Had the honorable member taken the trouble to read; the advertisement inserted in the newspapers inviting ' tenders for the mail service, he would have known that it was specifically stated that the mails were to be carried from a **British** port to Adelaide.

* I think that if we get this measure passed, containing the amendment that is now proposed to settle a side issue, we shall commence - and if we have able administrators we shall succeed - in developing the remarkable resources of **British** New Guinea, and shall thus contribute to the welfare of our Commonwealth.

* I do not believe that there is a Parliamentary Committee or a Court of Judicature in the **British** Empire which has the powers proposed to be given by this Bill.

* In 1889 a Select Committee of the House of Commons reported - 
Wentworth is no more free as a member of the present Opposition than is a baggage mule attached to any arm of the **British** Forces is free.

* I do not know what is done in regard topetitions affecting the return of a member to the **British** House of Commons; but for a number of years they were dealt with by Committees.

* Mr. Herbert  Paul, in  A History of Modern England,  states that trade unionists did more to uplift the masses of Great Britain during the last century than all that had ever been done at Westminster; that all the laws passed by the **British** Parliament, with a view to this end, sink into significance as compared with the good achieved  by trade unions.

* I doubt very much whether we can find in the House what is known  as  the Tory element in **British** politics.

* Besides that we have a great national policy, and I think every honorable member will agree with, me that if all the islands of the Pacific, which are within our sphere of influence, could have been appropriated  by  the **British** Crown, so as to keep from our shores any unpleasant foreign element, it would have been better for Australia.

* I have heard objections raised to the **British** control of these islands, and to the admission of products from them into Australia upon a preferential basis or duty free.

* I am prepared to vote for duties of  30  and  25  per cent., unless the Treasurer can show that  5  per cent, is not enough difference between the German or Japanmade bottles, as against the **British** article-

* If the farmers had to pay a 10 per cent, duty - the **British** preference proposal - the holder of a 640 acre block would incur a liability of 10 12s., and under the arrangement made by the Government of New South Wales he would have twenty years within which to pay that amount.

* When at the New Hebrides, I heard of a splendid action by a number of **British** Indians, whom I call servile subjects of the King.

* We have heard a good deal in reference to other **British** monarchs, but I. claim that all the dearest privileges which we enjoy  were associated with the reign of our late Queen.

* The experience of the **British** Customs is that you can in no way reach the prosecution of an offender so effectually as by insisting that every description in a Customs entry shall be true.

* Had the action of which I complain been the result of an Executive act, the position would be very different; but I believe that the House, like every other **British** Assembly, will declare that no punishment shall be meted out to an accused person until he has been given an opportunity to refute the charges brought against him.

* Mr. Chamberlain  used a proposal for old-age pensions to appeal to thesentiments of the **British** public, and gain support for his fiscal proposals.

* When the Act was under consideration in this House, the honorable member for North Sydney, who had read of the costliness of the proceedings in connexion with disputed elections to the **British** House of Commons, specially warned honorable members against constituting the High Court a Court of Disputed Returns.

* It is so vital to the welfare of the nation that we should regard only the fact that if we are going to save this country, we must get the people on to the land In the Sydney  Star  for  28th  August,  1909,  appears an article dealing with that marvellous demonstration of England's naval greatness - the **British** fleet arrayed for the editors of the Empire to see.

* The fee  is  generally paid by affixing a **British** revenue duty stamp.

* In 1884, just after the action of Queensland in annexing Papua to Australia, Victoria, under the Government of the late  Mr. James  Service, in order to protect its trade, annexed  the New  Hebrides to the **British** Empire on its own account.

* The Government are to be commended for altering our legislation so that it will be less distasteful to the Japanese nation, with which, as part of the **British** Empire, we are in close alliance.

* In the **British** House of Commons, the business is really carried on by about twenty-five members, who, out of the 600 odd members, may be regarded as professional politicians.

* It is bad for the **British** race that they should be compelled to work for  such pitiful wages, in bringing about which the Shipping Federation has certainly more than a small share.

* As a matter of fact, it is on the tidal waters of the Potomac, while Chesapeake Bay is not very far away, and the Capitol was burnt clown by a hostile **British** force.

* I venture to say that in the **British** Parliament, the gag is never resorted to unless there has been a deliberate -and longcontinued effort at obstruction.

* Those honorable members who are so anxious to prohibit the introduction of liquor into **British** New Guinea, and to that extent to interfere with the liberty of the white men there, should consider the effect of prohibition, so far as it has been applied to the liquor traffic in the Commonwealth.

* The whole of the criticism passed upon the Senate's amendment has been based upon the supposition that we have allowed full local option to the residents of **British** New Guinea.

* Mr. LONSDALE (New England).- The more these proceedings are protracted, the more humiliated I feel to think that the great Federal Parliament is wrestling at this hour of the morning with a proposal to put obstacles in the way of the admission of a few **British** immigrants under contract.

* They have extolled unionism to the skies, and have said that it has done more to bring about the present improved condition of the **British** and Australian worker, than has any other force in our political and social life.

* I do not know whether the **British** Government or the Queensland Government have reports which might be supplied to us, but, in any case, it is time that we began to supply ourselves with information on the subject.

* I consider that the present condition of the House is one which is entirely foreign to constitutional principles, and entirely foreign to any **British** method of conducting parliamentary institutions.

* I am not in favour of the proposal of the honorable and learned member for Corio, because I think it would be rather a piebald proposal to speak of crews the majority of which shall be **British** subjects.

* How do the Government suggest that a preference should be given to **British** goods?

* The human intellect can never be enslaved so long as there is freedom of speech ; but the moment that the liberty which has elevated the **British** race is taken from them, evils will be created the results of which cannot be foreseen.

* He has been foremost in the federation movement ; he is an Imperialist of the well-known brand and order, and yet we hear him talking of England and Canada, and every other **British** country, as though they were foreign countries, and should therefore be kept at a distance when our manufactures are concerned.

* He knew that there can be no such thing as preferential trade in the near future between any of the **British** Dependencies and Great Britain.

* Let us suppose that some action is taken in **British** New Guinea, as the result of which a lawyer is brought face to face with this Bill.

* They profess to be actuated by a desire to populate Australia with the right class of people, and, while getting subscriptions to the League for that purpose, they use the money to deceive the **British** public, and to degrade  the public sentiment of Australia.

* An instalment towards that end was made in 1847, by the coinage of the florin, which is the tenth part of the  1  ; the assumption being that under any system the sovereign would be retained as the unit of **British** coinage.

* I need not point out to honorable members the enormous Value which the **British** Pharmacopoeia  places  on the extract of opium as an anodyne.

* All **British** whiskies are produced under the control and supervision of the officers of the Board of Inland Revenue.

* At the present time the little country of Denmark exports something like 45 per cent, of all the butter used by the **British** people.

* In 1898, it supplied only 5 per cent, of the **British** imports, but in 1902, its contribution amounted to 12 per cent.

* I urge, as I have on previous occasions, the desirableness of at least temporarily suspending the Tariff, so far as produce grown by **British** labour in Papua and the islands of the South Pacific is concerned.

* There has been some talk of the danger of excluding our fellow **British** subjects from India, but I am inclined to think that that danger has been very much exaggerated.

* I confess that I have regarded this Bill as essentially a Committee Bill, requiring to be considered almost clause by clause, and line by line, to make it an effective instrument for the protection of the interests of those entitled to trade marks - that is, as they are understood throughout the whole **British** community.

* In one of his speeches  Mr. Henniker  Heaton dealt with the matter, and showed that the subsidies paid by the **British** and Australian Governments would be quite sufficient if capitalized to provide for a State-owned fleet.

* He stated that we must wait for a request from the **British** Government before taking action, and the  Age  in a leading article published on the 30th October last, after the speech of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, outlining the policy of his Government, said - 
No, I desire to legislate for Australia as a whole.

* The whole of the **British** national debt is owned by her own people.

* As to the procedure adopted in the **British** Parliament and its.

* It seems to me most un-English to provide in clause 6 that competition shall be deemed: to be unfair until the contrary is proved, because in **British** law a man is always held to be innocent until his guilt has been proved..

* It is proposed to adapt that law to the conditions of Australia, and, accordingly, we desire to afford those who are interested in the measure every opportunity to see how far the provisions of the **British** Act are applicable.

* But subsequently his attitude changed, until all that underlay his speech was a good **British** tone.

* For the defence of our shores we now depend upon the **British** Navy.

* The Minister is, however, in this happy position - that within eight weeks from now the best organizing authority in the **British** Army is to arrive in Australia.

* responsibility which rested' upon him to preserve the position of Australia in the eyes of the **British** public, he made a splendid fight.

* I cannot speak as to Tasmania, but so far as my recollection goes, and it extends over a great many years, there have been no importations of stock for food consumption into New South Wales, where, of course, there has been no duty: A few years ago an immense number of **British** breeding sheep, Lincoln rams particularly, were imported into New South Wales, and it soon became evident to the people of New Zealand that there was no market for them in the former State.

* We of the **British** race make many mistakes, but when 
It is quite possible that the Committee will recommend the abolition of the submarine mine establishment, for the purpose of bringing all the ports of the Empire into line in this regard.

* But the reason which will probably be urged for its abolition is that the **British** authorities have* not confidence in the control bv shore authorities of submarine mines.

* In spite of the attitude of the **British** Government - an attitude which they had to take up in view of the general election through which they had just passed- representatives of the Commonwealth Government assisted to pass a resolution re-affirming the principle embodied in the resolution of the last Parliament in favour of granting a substantial preference to the products of the mother country.

* It is enterprise and competition that has made the **British** Empire what it is.

* Whatever distress we may have here, there is always bread for the children, and therefore there is not the temptation to destroy child-life which may exist in London and other **British** cities.

* Then let me point to- India, a country which has no franchise, whose inhabitants are' without representation, but are absolutely tinder the control of the **British** Government - a country where no man, white or coloured, can exercise the right of a citizen.

* We are to have a branch stream of the great river of **British** justice coursing through the plains of Australia.

* At the commencement of Federation we decided - in my opinion rightly - that we would have a White Australia ; but no man who regards the future with an unprejudiced mind can deny that it is impossible that we, although under the **British** flag, can continue to hold this country for ever if it remains undeveloped.

* Similarly for the half-year ended December, 1900, the **British** Broken Hill 
I agree with the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that there ought to be a considerable reduction in the duty on articles to which he has referred.

* My idea is that the duty in the general Tariff should be reduced from 35 to 15 per cent., and that **British** imports should be made free.

* An increased sum of 1,500 is provided for in respect of **British** New Guinea.

* From  a  Victorian point of view, I desire to express my dissent from the Government proposal; I understand that there are only 214 **British** residents in the New Hebrides, and  I  have calculated that the proposed vote of 12,000 would represent a grant of 56 per unit of that population.

* They were supplied by a Melbourne firm, but they contravened a patent held by a foreign company - that is to say, a **British**, company.

* The Minister must recollect that many **British** firms now send out buyers to Australia to purchase goods for the English market, and that an article which may find favour in one particular locality will not be accepted in another.

* In this respect they have succeeded in producing an instrument which, in its penalties, sanctions, and powers, goes far beyond anything that has been attempted in a **British** community I do not pretend to say that legislation, severe and unusual, is not required to meet the far-reaching evils of industrial trusts ; but the measures should receive the fullest possible consideration, with a desire to make their provisions such as will afford a possibility of administering them as Parliament intended them to be administered.

* He has had a long experience of every constitutional position under the **British** Crown, and he has acquitted himself so well that those who may hereafter fill the distinguished office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth will need to be upon their guard lest they fall short of the high standard which he has set up.

* An old man named Harry Carrier, a native of Mauritius, and the son of a Madrasee, who was a **British** soldier, has been in receipt of a pension from the State for over seven years.

* Liquor is obtainable at very low cost close to the **British** and German boundary, and nothing would be easier than tosmuggle liquor from one Possession to the other.

* There is a great deal to be said in favour of a preferential Tariff, so far as the **British** Empire is concerned ; but,.

* Now I come to the first Ministerial statement of policy, which, for the first time in the history of parliamentary institutions in the **British** Empire, was made to a party in the House not in alliance with the Government.

* I do not know whether honorable members are aware of the fact that at certain seasons of the year the pilchard, which is really a herring, passes along the eastern coast of Australia in shoals which are just as numerous as those to be found in the North of the **British** Islands.

* If the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Bill were an Act, it would be a proper thing to propose to amend it in this way, but as it is not, the correct procedure, as we cannot amend the Bill directly, is to set it aside, and to introduce a new Bill without the objectionable provision.

* Is it possible to get a measure before us before we know that the **British** Government will hand it over to us?

* I have no doubt that with our experience of land settlement, which we have gained in previous years, the administration of this territory under the Commonwealth will be much better than it was under the **British** .

* The **British** Medical Association practically said to them, " If you continue to remain at the Hospital we shall declare you to be black-legs."

* It cannot be said that **British** experience in any of the wars of the last century has proved the value of the General Officer Commanding system.

* The **British** Empire is already separated in detail, and on that account it would be worse than foolish of us - it would be absolute madness - to withhold our assistance from any of the portions of the Empire that might be seriously threatened.

* We all know that that has been recognised as a subject of legislation in every country in the **British** Empire.

* This is a **British** ship, employing a foreign crew atthe rate of ?4 per month.The captain as continually disrating the crew, and by that means reducing the wages.

* The honorable member for Mernda quoted from the **British**  Hansard  to show what took place in the House of Commons when  Mr. Gully  was first nominated for the position of  Speaker.

* Under the **British** law the Crown can compel a patentee to make his invention available to them for nothing.

* There is no question as to the capability of our workmen, because I have in my electorate some of the most expert ironworkers in the whole of the **British** dominions.

* The idea of the **British** Government informing the Commonwealth that no contribution to the expense of sending the contingent will be asked from Australia seems to be poohpoohed, but I think it was very right that that fact should be stated.

* I do not think that it would be in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution, or with the **British** Constitution, for members of the Government to become virtually members of both Houses ; nor would it be pleasant or right if a Minister were placed in such a position that he would be called upon to enter a Chamber of which he was not a member to explain certain matters, and afterwards be.

* The Ministry have offered the **British** Government a gift of a  Dreadnought  for which we shall have to pay  2,000,000,  and in this connexion I have some interesting figures to put before the House.

* The honorable member for Parkes knows that in all **British** Parliaments in Australia and elsewhere, it is the privilege of one member to object to the abrogation of the rules ; on such occasions, one member, for all practical purposes, is the House.

* I hope that every member of the House, whether he be the Prime Minister or a private member, and no matter in what part of the 
**British** officer would serve in Australia if  Major Lenehan  was allowed to remain in his position j to which I replied that the Government would deal with all such matters as they thought lit'.

* It is our bounden duty to assist to defend the commerce of this great Empire, as well as to protect our own shores, and the only way we can defend our commerce is to assist the **British** Navy.

* There was not such a keen desire to imitate **British** legislation in respect to a measure which remedied substantial injustices.

* Why should the " little Australia" idea prevail to the extent of excluding us from sending men beyond our limits, in order to protect our interests, or to discharge our obligations  1  One would think that we did not belong to the **British** Empire, and that, no matter what part of the Empire was attacked, we should not be legally prevented from lending our aid.

* The kerosene supply of the world is practically obtained from two companies - the Standard Oil Company, and the **British** Shale Transport and Trading Company.

* The **British** Navy is intended to insure the protection of the coast of Great Britain by hunting the enemy and by destroying his fortifications and works of defence.

* When the **British** preference proposals were introduced, objections were raised by honorable members opposite, one after another of whom  uttered  the oldparrot cry that no preference could possibly be given to the old country without a reduction of duty in every instance.

* I speak as a Republican of twenty years ago; but my visit to the East showed m-i the danger to be apprehended from that quarter; and I desire to see no severance of the ties we have, not only to the Home Land, but to our brothers of the United States, who number more English-speaking people than there are in all the **British** Dominions.

* We all know very well the history of the **British** Admiralty and the relationship which exists between it and the Ministry.

* Another point to which I should like to refer is the preference which has recently been given by the South African Colonies - which are almost a Zollverein - to other parts of the **British** dominions, under a reciprocal treaty.

* We are now concerned in framing a Constitution for **British** New Guinea, under which the people will govern themselves, and if we passed the Bill without the provision inserted by this House, we should, when the subject comes up for consideration at a future date, be met with the objection, "The Constitution already passed by this Parliament allows the importation of liquor into New Guinea, and it would be unfair to deprive the people of the Territory of the rights which they are enjoying."

* A man named William Thomas Sheehan has been detained at Queenscliff by the military authorities, in my opinion altogether against the law, and certainly in violation of the rights which every man in the Commonwealth should enjoy as a **British** citizen.

* We shall vote against the motion for adjournment with no other desire than to protest, as strongly as we can, against delay on the part of this .Parliament in expressing the views of the Australian people on a subject which we consider to be of the highest moment to the Commonwealth as an integral part of the **British** Empire.

* Notwithstanding the statement of the Treasurer to the contrary, he says that the agitation for the remission of these duties is not hysterical, but that the farmers are in earnest about it, and, as the result of the agitation in _ his district, he suggested a duty' of 15 per cent, against foreign manufacturers, allowing **British** manufactures to come in at 10 per cent.

* Amongst the firms who furnished replies to questions issued by the **British** Tariff Commission was a manufacturer who spoke of the competition which the trade there had to meet, and it must not be forgotten that we in turn are (suffering from their competition.

* for the same work and longer hours in the **British** mills.

* Owing to the honorable member for Capricornia, I was able to take advantage of the presence in Melbourne of the **British** Vice-Consul for Manila - who was passing through only a week or two ago - to discover from him the present position.

* comparison between Australian and **British** white lead, because the same statement would apply to the two processes in Great Britain.

* I never heard of the Clerkin the House of Commons having a vote of the kind; but, even if that hag been so, we must remember that the **British** Parliament is not governed by a written Constitution.

* In the latter case, an enemy's ship would not need to come near the bay, but might remain five or six miles distant, and- from there reduce the place to ashes in no time, in the same way as Alexandria was bombarded by the **British** some years ago.

* How can an applicant know of his own knowledge whether he was born a **British** subject?

* If it does, I have no hesitation in saying that within twenty years the Territory will be one of the modelColonies of the **British** Empire.

* The **British** Empire has abolished the old antiquated ideas of blasphemy and sedition, and yet it is proposed that this enlightened Federal Parliament should put them into this clause, so that we may have a taste of tyranny in this Southern Hemisphere.

* If what I have referred to is the honorable member's policy we should shut up all our ports and let **British** ships disappear from them.

* If the **British** people had not done that in days gone by, the race would not now be occupying its present position.

* It has been pointed out by a number of residents of **British** New Guinea that the appointment of honorary magistrates in the Territory has not been so satisfactory as it might have been.

* It finds its origin in the policy of the **British** Mouse of Commons, and if we are unable to adopt the Imperial fiscal  policy  in its entirety, we may accept it as a guide in regard to general principles.

* I repeat that this is a Bill for the prevention of the destruction of Australian industries, no matter from what country the -attempt may be made, and those who support the amendment are really pleading that Australian industries may be destroyed by monopolistic manufacturers of Great Britain, Canada, or any other part of the **British** Empire.

* One is led to (lie inevitable conclusion that it is because of the preferential of from 25 to 30 per cent, which applies to all goods imported from Great Britain, and which puts the Canadian manufacturer into direct competition with the pauper labour of the English textile centres) while Canada is made the dumping ground of the cheap trash in which **British** manufacturers have such an advantage through their ability to manipulate successfully with cheap raw material and cheap labour.

* Where we have a definite legal sense attached to any term, and it is quite clear what thai terra means, and where, moreover/ the phrase is copied from the **British** Act upon which insurance legal decisions are based, we should be wise in standing by it.

* A person taking up land in **British** New Guinea would expect to be granted a fairly long tenure at a low rental, and I should be prepared to give a tenure of 40 or 50 years at a peppercorn rental.

* With regard to the subject now before the Chamber, I confess that I never attach much importance to questions involved in the names by which **British** communities are known.

* The impression has got abroad, rightly or wrongly, that **British** people are not wanted here.

* That impression has been deepened by the recent debate in the Trades Hall Council of Melbourne upon the proposal to bring out immigrants by arrangement 
No ; because if we make anything compulsory in a **British** community we do not recommend it to the general sense of the people.

* The principle on which legislation has always proceeded in regard to trade marks in every **British** community, and indeed in every civilized community in the world, has been to grant legislative Protection to the owner of a trade mark, independently of what he does with that trade mark.

* To-night we find that the members of the Opposition are prepared to levy a duty upon candles, which will permit of their introduction even fromforeign countries, to say nothing of **British** imports.

* Might I ask also whether it would nt have been infinitely better to construct a Customs launch in Australia instead of buying a launch which I believe - I am not sure - has the tainted record of having been built in some other part of the **British** Empire?

* In such circumstances, what is the use of standing up and pointingto Australia, as our great men do, as the one place in the **British** Empire where theequality of the manhood and womanhood of the country has been fearlessly affirmed..

* In less than four years also, the colossal blunder made by the present Administration in offering a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Government will have to be paid for.

* Jervis Bay is second only to Sydney Harbor, and is regularly resorted to by the **British** men of war for firing practice.

* The Bill is designed merely to fill up a gap that was inadvertently left in the Service and Execution of Process Bill as passed by us, and is in strict accordance with **British** legislation.

* I have had some experience in connexion with an endeavour to foster the wine industry by placing our wines upon the London market, and I know that the great difficulty in connexion with Australian wines arises from their want of regular quai it)r. Inasmuch as we have provided under the Victorian law that nothing but spirit distilled from grapes shall be used for wine fortification, I think it would be extremely unfair, after all the money we have spent in placing our wines before the **British** public, if it became known that Australian vignerons were permitted to use any other than grape spirit in the fortification of their wines.

* Clause 8 of the Bill provides that a person who is naturalized shall be entitled to all political rights and privileges to which a natural born **British** subject is entitled.

* No strong drink can be sold in **British** New Guinea in smaller quantities than one quart, but we have five hotels and eighteen licensed houses, practically selling it by the dram every day.

* In many Customs entries the source of origin is stated for the purposes of **British** statistics, and any false statement in that connexion would veryproperly be considered a contravention of the Act.

* foreigner will mean that the cotton and linen manufacturers of England who, at present, work upon a margin of only 21 per cent, will be able to exclude the foreigner from the market altogether, and we shall, consequently be at the mercy of **British** manufacturers who are not above forming rings.

* What I would suggest is the introduction of Indian coolies under an indentured system, which has worked so well in other parts of the **British** dominions.

* in Australia would have to consider the welfare of the 400,000 natives in **British** New Guinea, and not the 600 white settlers, who had gone there principally to do the best they could for, and who were quite prepared to look after, themselves.

* I, personally, wish to see our Naval Brigades given a field of training ; but what better field can they have than the **British** Navy?

* Unlike other **British** Possessions, and other countries of the world, we are in the happy position of never having had to engage in a war, not even a native war.

* It will be seen that the duty is really directed against **British** importations, and that its value as a protective duty is not worth talking about.

* It is because we have that ceaseless protector, the **British** Navy, always watching our shores, that we can carry out our desires in that direction ; and it is a policy which I sincerely hope we shall be able to maintain for all time.

* That Court, at present, entertains all appeals from the Courts of **British** New Guinea; it is convenient to the Possession, and it has hitherto done the work very well.

* They are of importance to Australia, but not necessarily to the **British** Empire, and to me Australia comes before the Empire.

* No doubt, so long as we depend on the **British** Navy for protection as the basis of our defence, all that Ministers can do is to fill in subsidiary parts or gaps in our scheme of defence.

* I take it that the intimation has arrived from  Mr. Woodford,  who is the **British** Resident in the Solomon Islands.

* The honorable member for Barker declared that  it  was  an  extraordinary piece  of  draftsmanship, but, as  an  actual fact, it was drafted  by  the most eminent draftsman in the **British** Empire.

* A man charged with the gravest crime in the calendar is by **British** law not considered guilty until he has been proved so.

* in the **British** Parliament.

* In the opinion of the writer of, the article from which I have quoted, the passing of the socialistic provisions of this Bill will have a very injurious effect upon **British** investors.

* Even so would it seem to have been in that curious marriage of competing influences and powers, which brings about the composite harmony of the **British** Constitution.

* ; and I intend to move, I hope with the approval, of the Treasurer, that the duty be fixed at 5 per cent, against the **British** article, and 10 per cent, against the foreign article.

* T believe that only one firm in England has constructed submarines for the **British** Government.

* In fact, the **British** Constitution rests upon the American potato.

* Lauder Brunton, who is, I suppose, the greatest living authority we have upon therapeutics, gave evidence some time ago before the select committee on **British** and foreign spirits.

* He was asked : - 
Referring to the reply of the **British** Australian Tobacco Company to the strictures of  Senator Pearce  and others, they quote my evidence before the Tariff Commission - Question 2S419, Tariff Commission's report, " It  (i.e.,  the stemmed leaf) is put on the market," &amp;c, &amp;c. 1 do not know whether this mistake occurred through my using, inadvertently, the word " stemmed" instead of "stripped," or whether the stenographer, thinking they both meant the same thing, used the word " stemmed," but theword should be "stripped" and not "stemmed."

* Our trade with the foreigner direct aggregates 1.0,200,000 annually, and our exports to him through **British** ports represents 6,800,000, making' a .grand total of  1  7,000,000 worth of exports annually.

* I do not know of any case in **British** history in which it has been done, although I think that something of the sort has been done in Germany.

* If we impose duties of 30 and 25 per cent., giving the **British** manufacturers a preference of 5 per cent., we shall deal very liberally with the local industry.

* I would not tolerate for one moment the interference of **British** statesmen in a matter in regard to which we are sure of our facts.

* In the interests of the coloured races of **British** New Guinea I propose to vote for prohibition.

* Itcan, moreover; hardly be supposed that Australians desire to repudiate their responsibilities as a portion of the **British** Empire in regard to co-operation for defence, more especially of their fellowcountrymen in New Zealand.

* manner in which they were treated - still, while I take that view, I should not like to assert that among any body of **British** workmen, at any rate, a single defeat would do more than accentuate their desire to get justice.

* all round, but it was pointed out by the honorable member for North Sydney that this would confer some benefit upon the Belgian glass-makers as against the **British** manufacturers whose product is generally of a higher value.

* The resources which have been displayed by the Boers, and  the prolongation  of the struggle, indicate that their intention was not only to defend their country - for which there can be small blame to them - but also to drive the **British** out of South Africa, and to establish their own supremacy there.

* Every day the dual control over the New Hebrides must result in more and more complications, and we cannot press too strongly upon our Government the need for representing to the **British** Government the desirability of having the affairs of ' these islands administered by the Commonwealth.

* Although it is a **British** Colony, still kanakas and Indians work on the sugar plantations.^ 
I am aware that special efforts have been made in that direction.

* While I admit that there has been a straining of the purpose of the provision, because it has not been understood, still the news of the concrete act of refusing to allow a few men to land here ' was spread broadcast throughout the **British** Empire.

* The Minister was good enough to say that he could not give an answer until he had had some further communication with the High Commissioner for the Pacific, and the **British** Resident in the New Hebrides.

* The Treasurer mentioned, as one of the inducements held out to Western Australia to join the Federation, a statement made by the present Prime Minister, to the effect that undoubtedly the construction of this railway would follow Federation, in just the same way that the Eastern Canadian States were, connected by rail with **British** Columbia.

* The whole practice of the **British** Parliament depends upon the preservation of the distinction between proceedings in Committee and proceedings in the House, and for  Mr. Speaker  to come here and direct the Committee seems to me to be most improper.

* These do not produce interest at more than 1 per cent., and they are quoted at 115, whereas **British** Consols which pay 2 9s.

* The talk we have heard about American trusts has no weight with me, because some of the best drills that come to this country are **British**.

* Who, I ask, paid the expense of sending Captain Cook to Australia to appropriate it for the **British** people?

* I know of no instance where a matter of this kind has been dealt with in the way proposed in any **British** Parliament.

* If those entries remain, it will be open for a member of this or some other Parliament in the **British** Dominions to quote it as a precedent for the  Clerk  casting a vote on an occasion when the two sides are equal.

* The honorable member for Darling has referred to the experience of the **British** soldiers in the Crimea.

* If' they have read it, they will see that in these antidumping provisions there is not a word that is directed against any **British** trade whatever, except the trade that comes here with the intention to destroy Australian industries.

* The Constitution, section 51, subsection xxx., gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate with respect to the relations of the Commonwealth with the islands of the Pacific, but gives no authority to assume any control, nor does it make any distinction between **British** and other islands.

* It is of a piece with those deliberate misrepresentations to the detriment of Australia that have been spread broadcast, in the most infamous way, by the **British** press.

* The secretary to the Blumberg mine,  Mr. O'Connell,  gave pretty lengthy evidence before the Commission as to the necessity for a duty to enable the company to compete against wealthy **British** companies.

* Either course would give the officer concerned the opportunity to reply to any charges brought against him, which is only **British** justice.

* The proposed preference is a mere sham, but it shows clearly that the protectionists of Australia are under the wing of the **British** Conservatives.

* (c)  Were the preferential rates in favour of **British** goods determined upon and added to the Tariff only at the  last  moment?

* principal one is that pointed out by the honorable member for Barrier, and attributed to me - that, having regard to the value of our mercantile marine in its relation to the Navy, the Imperial Government must soon give attention to the question of the- employment of coloured and foreign labour upon **British** merchantmen.

* I do not see any evidence - now that the election is over, and the right honorable gentleman has been able to secure a large number of votes - of any intention on the part of the Government to give any preference to **British** goods.

* Bearing upon the question which I asked  yesterday  in reference to the supply of remounts to the **British** Government, I wish to read part of an article published in the London  Daily Mail  of 7th May last, under the heading - " Remounts for the Future : Colonies to be asked for Annual Supply."

* The article says : - 
- In regard to the suggestion which I made recently I would place before the Committee a clause from the **British** Bill for the Defence of Poor Prisoners, which I think might be added, with a slight alteration, to the proposed new sub-clause.

* I wish to know from the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Treasurer, whether the arrangement come to with the **British** Government with respect to the coinage of silver includes the making of provision for the cost of replacing all worn gold coins minted in Australia.

* If the honorable member's amendment were carried, they would be prohibited even from landing, and the prohibition would apply, not only to the crews of **British** and foreign vessels engaged in our coastal trade, but also to the crews of oversea vessels touching at only one port of the Commonwealth.

* The Holman drill which, I believe, is made in Cornwall, is one of the best here; and if we are to have preference, it should be in favour of the **British** drill, as against the combination drill to which reference has been made.

* Encouraged by above and many another grand successes of my **British** clients, which they obtained through the medium of my appointed Chief Lottery Agency, I beg leave to invite you to try your  luck  in the world-wide renowned Hamburg State Lottery as well, with a trifling stake, and with the prospect to gain a fortune.

* But the case the honorable member puts is that of Japanese, Chinese, or other foreign boats - even **British** boats like those of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company - which come into Australia during a strike.

* There is not only propriety in having this inquiry, but there is also a leaning on the part of the **British** Government to grant us what we ask, and if, on the report of the committee, we have something to ask, so much the better.

* Since that date the country has received, with last year's dividends, a sum of upwards of ^'5,500,000, three-fifths of which has been paid in dues by **British** vessels using the Canal.

* He then proceeded to point out that we could not have a monopoly of mechanical appliances; that we could not have better machinery than the **British** pr German manufacturers have.

* The proposed dutv is not protective in its incidence, because there is no duty on **British** importations, and it is admitted that we cannot compete with' them.

* In reply to the points of order raised, I point out that the custom of the **British** House of Commons applies here when we have no rules of our own specifically dealing with a case.

* I am speaking of  **British** ship-owners as foreigners only in the sense that they are intruders upon the domain of our local shipping companies.

* Owing to the extreme subdivision of the labour and trades employed in producing these goods, even the United "States market is supplied by **British** manufacturers, and there is no chance of the article being made here right out at a profit, as it would first require a number of auxiliary trades to be established for which there is not sufficient employment.

* And he goes on to show that we cannot have better machines, we cannot have better factories referring to **British** and German factories - and he says that the manufacturers of England and Germany can buy their raw material all over the world.

* Then he says this, and I commend it to my honorable friends who point out how much freetrade has done for England - 
The Treasurer has had his name attached to documents upon every subject under the sun-, from the **British** Navy down to the aneroid, with the result that he has only tended to confuse his readers.

* We should have a separate vote, on the proposal that the duty on **British** imports shall be 5 per cent., and another vote on the proposed general import duty of 10" per cent.

* ; and 1 understand that the honorable member for Angas intends subsequently to move to leave out the duty on candles of **British** manufacture.

* When I speak of " foreigners" I have in mind those living outside the **British** Empire.

* That has been shown by the Attorney-General's reference to section 62 of the Trade Marks Act passed last August by the **British** Parliament, and which only repeats in substance what appears in earlier Acts.

* At page 817 they point out that - 
It may be mentioned that there appears to be some likelihood of aiming tubes being superseded in the **British** service by a special miniature rifle, and it is not intended to order any more tubes for the Commonwealth Military Forces until the result of inquiries, which the officer in charge of the Commonwealth Offices in London has been asked to make, is known.

* Is he aware that the highest officers in the **British**  Army  to-day have not passed through the Staff College?

* The **British** Act says that any ship or boat shall be liable to seizure that does not bring to.

* On the contrary, when visiting Cairns, I took the opportunity of speaking, wherever possible, to the recent arrivals, although all those I met were of **British** parentage and spoke English.

* In the event of the Fremantle fortifications being proceeded with, it is proposed to transfer there from Adelaide a mark 7, 6-inch breech-loading gun, which is the latest pattern of breechloading gun used for land service by the **British** Army.

* I believe that the decision upon the amendment submitted to  Mr. Speaker  upon a former occasion, the amendment having the effect of increasing taxation, was contrary to the Standing Orders, and to the practice of all **British** Parliaments.

* Is it not a fact that the correspondence between the late Minister of External Affairs and the German Consul for Australia, in regard to the deportation of one Stelling, has led to diplomatic communications between the German and the **British** Governments concerning certain expressions used in that correspondence reflecting on the Consul named ?

* The question of local option for **British** New 
Itake it that the importers of these goods, if they were introduced in other than **British** bottoms, have already increased their price to the consumer.

* Will he lay upon the table a return showing the total amount and value of **British** imports and exports between Australia and the Pacific Islands for the years ended 30th June, 1906 and 1907 respectively, particularly .with reference to the New Hebrides and Papua?

* The manufacture was now so firmly established that the makers were able to compete with the **British** factories on equal terms.

* I wish to know from the Prime Minister if the number of hours fixed in the proposed mail contract for the journey between Brindisi and Adelaide, and the extension allowed during the monsoon months, are the same :is in the new contract between' the -**British** Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company?

* The Solomon, Gilbert, and Ellice groups are already under the **British** flag.

* I understand that hitherto it has been the **British** custom' to make bronze coins up to  5s.

* The consequence of these precautions was that the Japanese succeeded in so reversing the percentage of deaths from preventable diseases occurring in other armies, that, although **British** and American Armies have lost three men from disease for every one killed by bullets, the Japanese lost only one from disease for every three killed by bullets.

* I am sure that the honorable member for Maranoa, who is the only member with practical experience of a soldier's life, never knew such a thing to happen in connexion with the **British** Forces.

* I believe that representations were made through the GovernorGeneral by either the late Government or its predecessor as to the difficulties thrown in the way of **British** trade with the German, possessions in the South Seas.

* When cylinders of other than **British** origin are used in this trade, and are returned for refilling, the CustomsDepartment permits them to enter free, upon security being given by the importers that they will be exported within a specific period.

* Each new settler will share our prosperity, and will share also the burden of our taxation, whilst at the same time assisting us to make Australia one of the finest parts of the **British** Empire.

* Biscuits go to the East from these States- and compete with **British** biscuits, and I hope to see more markets wrested for Australia.

* As I said on the second reading, there is a greater violation done in this Bill to the individual liberties and rights of the citizens of a civilized country than I know of in any other legislation in the **British** Empire.

* That the persistent misrepresentation abroad of the legislative and administrative measures of the Commonwealth reflects unjustly on the character of the Australian people, and tends to operate prejudicially to the progress of Australia by checking immigration and impairing the credit of the States in the estimation of **British** and foreign investors.

* A Conference was recently held between representatives of the **British** and French Governments for the purpose of settling certain details respecting the proposed joint Court and other matters arising out of the New Hebrides .

* -Will the Prime Minister  lay upon the table, with a view to their circulation amongst honorable members, the objections to certain clauses of the Navi gation Bill which have been transmitted to him at the instance of the **British** Board of Trade, together with the correspondence connected therewith ?

* We would therefore entreat the authorities to give our case consideration, trusting in their **British** love of fair play.

* I am told that the South African company, having been permitted by an unknown Minister of Customs, whom, as he denies it, we will call X, to send its black-labour dynamite or gelignite into the Commonwealth, has actually applied to be allowed to come under the **British** Preference section of the Act, because it manufactures its explosives in South Africa.

* Within that time, going no further than the **British** Empire, thought has advanced greatly; and why should we not make a demand on the wealth of the country to enable us from the ist January, next year, to pay invalid pensions?

* That is the duty of this Parliament ; and it would have been not  only  the duty, but the pleasure, of the late Government to have staked their existence 
**British** possession (as the case may be) at the date of the alleged crime, whether by common law or by statute made before oralfter the passing of this Act i Murder, and attempt and conspiracy to murder ; manslaughter ; counterfeiting, and alteringmoney, and uttering counterfeit or altered money ; forgery, counterfeiting and altering, and uttering what is forged or counterfeit or altered ; embezzlement or larceny ; obtaining  money  or goods by false pretences ; crimes by bankrupts against bankruptcy law ; fraud by a bailee, banker, agent, factor, trustee, or director, or member, or public officer of any company made criminal by any Act for the time being in force ; rape, abduction, child-stealing, burglary and housebreaking, arson, robbery with violence, threats by letter or otherwise with intent to extort, piracy by law of nations, sinking or destroying a vessel at sea, or attempting or conspiring to do so ; assaults on board a ship on the high seas with intent to destroy life, or to do grievous bodily harm ; revolt or conspiracy to revolt by two or more persons on board a ship on the high seas, against the authority of the master.

* I have some knowledge of the Pimlico factory, in London, where there are thousands of hands employed, and where the whole of the clothing used by the military and naval forces throughout the **British** dominions is manufactured.

* I shall spare no effort in that direction, because I think that they are altogether foreign to our ideas of **British** liberty.

* In view of the importance of this subject, I ask the Prime Minister if he is prepared to amend the Act, so as to make it clear that passports are not required by **British** subjects coming here, and that its provisions apply only to men coming out under contract to fill the places' of others on strike.

* As considerable concern exists regarding the maintenance of **British** influence in the Pacific, can the Prime Minister inform the House as to the position of affairs in the New Hebrides, and assure us that the subject will receive his close attention during the recess?

* It was recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission that the duty on **British** imports should be 6s.

* Some time ago I urged the Treasurer to abolish the awful questions put to applicants for old-age pensions.It is not good in a **British**, Christian, civilized country to have such questions put to people who are old pioneers and old soldiers of industry.

* All  male  inhabitants of Australia (excepting those who are exempt from service in the Defence Force) who have resided therein for six months and are **British** subjects, and are between the ages of sixteen and sixty years shall, in time of war, be liable to serve in the Militia Forces.

* A continuous file is not kept - the post-office in this respect is not made a sort of **British** Museum in which to keep a record of all patents.

* Under the practice of the **British** House of Commons which, of course, we follow,
              and under any possible standing orders, interjections are disorderly.

* The Government know that the moment it is pointed out that this legislation is calculated to reduce the profits of foreign steamers, the owners of those vessels will have no difficulty in inducing their Governments to increase their subsidies, and so place them at a great advantage over Australian and **British** steamers.

* There is an expenditure also in regard to our only Possession - **British** New Guinea - of  20,000.

* Canada and **British** South Africa we represent now a greater total trade, and by fax a greater export trade, and that our Inter-State trade, since 1904, within Australia, has increased by 12,838,000..

* It would be idle to attach such a provision as this to the Bill in the hope that it would lead to a change in the manning of **British** ships.

* If so, is the Minister aware that the **British** Government, having adopted the short rifles, are using longer bayonets?

* I am quoting .from the sworn evidence before a Committee appointed by the **British** Board of Agriculture, and I ask honorable members to accept that evidence for what it is worth.

* Does the honorable and learned member think it desirable that an official should be placed before the **British** public in that capacity?

* In any case, it has been proved that the Australian manufacturers can do exactly what the **British** manufacturers do.

* I remember the incident to which the honorable member refers, when the ladies of the Queen's bed chamber played an important part in a **British** political crisis.

* This day week one of the greatest of the **British** race was still .

* million costs in fees prior to issue of patent more than a **British**, German, or French patent, and nearly as much as a United States patent ?

* A parcel addressed to you has been received by the **British** and foreign parcels post, and is now lying at this office where delivery may be obtained if required.

* As it is beyond question that arrangements could be made by which Australia would in the future be in a position to furnish an adequate and a satisfactory supply of remounts for the **British** Army, I would inquire from the Prime Minister as to what representations have been made to the English Government with respect to this matter ?

* I am not an alarmist, but I ask, what will be the position of Australia on the termination of **British** treaties with certain powers if we are not then ready to defend ourselves and Tasmania?

* Hulton, at Parliament House, on 15th February, 1902, said that " observant soldiers in South Africa had learnt that compulsory service is quite unnecessary for the **British** race, as we had fighting material without recourse to compulsion."

* In regard to the Brennan torpedo, the patent rights in which were acquired by the **British** Government at a cost of over ,100,000, I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to make inquiries with a view of ascertaining whether the right which the 
If t this sort of thing ruined the Roman Empire, so far back as that, what guarantee have we that it would not ruin the **British** Empire now ?

* It  was to ask the **British** Government to call an International Conference, in order to adopt a scheme that would protect the revenue, not only of Australia, but of the Old Country, and all other countries.

* I must admit that it is usual in **British**, as well as in Australian, legislation to make the bare fact of possession of goods which have unlawfully passed out of the control of the Customs an offence.

* Do not let us forget that of the five greatest cities in the **British** Empire 
I say that it is "made " in the sense in which the word " originated " is used in this Bill, and although the rules *of ,the House of Commons in this matter are no guide to us, the language of **British** Acts of Parliament has been a guide to us in the construction of the laws of the Commonwealth.

* New Zealand is, I believe, the only part of the **British** Empire which prevents shippers from contracting themselves out of their liabilities.

* Are these the kind of men who have built up the **British** Empire to be what it is to-day ?

* Yes, I understand that natives, par ticularly from the Western Division of **British** New Guinea, are employed as members of the crews of pearling vessels.

* **British** subject is not an alien or foreigner in Canada -  under contract or agreement parole or special express or implied made previous to the importation or immigration of such alien or foreigner to perform labour or service of any kind in Canada.

* I do not suppose that all the intelligence in the world reposes, in the mind of the **British** Parliamentary Draftsman.

* I, therefore, move - 
Are we to depart from the most cherished principles of **British** jurisprudence?

* I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will announce in the House this session the determination of the Government regarding the granting of preference to **British** goods where tenders are called by departments for the supply of imported material ?

* Bounties have been granted upon the production of -various commodities by Canada, France, Russia, Brazil, Columbia, **British** India, and various other countries, to which I need not specifically refer.

* I am not aware of any authority except the custom which applies the designation to members of the Executive Councils in **British** colonies, and which has in many cases been recognised by the Imperial authorities in the permission given to retain the designation after relinquishing office.

* We want our affairs carried on under the regis of the **British** Crown with as much dignity, but, at the same time, as much simplicity as possible.

* I understand that letters  posted  on board the vessels of the Orient Royal Mail Steamship Company, when travelling between Australian ports, bear **British** stamps, but it seems to me that, as the company is under contract to this Government for the conveyance of its mails, that arrangement is a very strange one.

* Assuming that the South Australian Parliament transferred the control of the Northern Territory to the Imperial authorities, and the latter administered it as a **British** Crown colony, would the Federal Government, under the Constitution, have any power to exclude aliens from it ?

* Can it be said that the Imperial Government has given up all control of New Guinea, when at any time there may be difficulty about the adjustment of the boundaries between the **British** and German possessions  1  I think that we should have some explanation with regard to all these matters.

* With regard to  Major Lenehan's  claims for pay and gratuities, and for compensation, on account of the confiscation of his horses, these are matters which took place during his service in the **British** Army, and the claims which he puts forward are only referable to that Service.

* Whether the Government is aware of any steps having been taken, in terms of the New Hebrides Convention, for the establishment of a Joint Court in connexion with the hearing and settlement of disputesaffecting the rights and interests of **British** and French settlers?

* I desire to encourage the use of Australian casks, and would place an order to-morrow if I were told where I could get Australian wood fit to make casks suitable for wine for the **British** trade.

* Act, and must be construed as such ; so that the ordinary rules of construction which have been applied by the **British** Courts for the past 200 or 300 years in construing **British** Acts must be followed by us in dealing with our Constitution.

* If we simply say to them that we bear them no malice whatever, that we are not even prepared to argue that they are inferior to us in any way, but that simply because Australia is to be the heritage of the **British** people we object to their coming here, we shall be taking up a position which is absolutely unassailable.

* We may point out that the Japanese in Australia are by no means the highly moral race that they ought to.be, but I think that the Japanese can fairly retort that the **British** people who visit Japan are by no means so moral as the Japanese themselves would like them to be.

* But if we take up the position that Australia is, in our opinion, a heritage for the **British** race alone, we can ask the acceptance of that dictum even by the Japanese themselves, because if Japan were threatened with an influx of foreign people in any such numbers as we threatened in Australia are threatened with, they would no doubt feel thoroughly justified in taking the measures which we are about to adopt.

* I wish to intimate to the House that, at an early date, I shall, in Committee of Ways and Means, move a resolution, which, if carried, will be followed by a Bill, to provide for the giving of a customs preference upon certain goods imported to Australia from the territory of Papua, or **British** New Guinea.

* At page 1243 of the **British**  Hansard  there is this reference to proceedings that took place in the House of Commons in March, 1861.

* The question before the Commons was the Board of Admiralty, and Admiral Duncombe spoke as follows - 
I would remind the Prime Minister that a famous **British** Minister once said that confidence is a plant of slow growth.

* I am informed by the honorable member for Maranoa, who has served in the **British** Army, that the Imperial regulations require that every recruit shall have a form setting forth the terms on which he is to be sworn  in,  placed in his hands.

* Item 78 (h) Engines, gas and oil, and highspeed engines and turbines, water and steam,  ad valorem  (**British**), 12 per cent.

* The New Hebrides are not within the Commonwealth, and this Government has no jurisdiction over any of the officials, **British** or foreign, who are intrusted with the government of the group.

* The attitude of the **British** Government has been, " We are going to defend Australia whether she defends herself or not, because, for many reasons, we value the possession as part and parcel of the Empire, which it would not suit us to lose either at the hands  of some other nation or by the cutting of the painter ; but if Australia stands up and makes her citizens capable of defending their own land, and thus  strengthens  this outpost of Empire, we shall be pleased and delighted."

* The utterances of members of the **British** Government are much more in favour of the defence scheme suggested than are the Tory speeches we hear from the Opposition benches in this House.

* The **British** Government look at this question in its broadest aspect, while the good Tories of the Commonwealth Opposition can only raise the dear old bogy of " Cut the painter."

* As this Convention favours, to the extent of 25 per cent., any **British** colony which reciprocates, will hetake the necessary steps to reciprocate, so that the expanding trade of the Commonwealth with South Africa will not suffer?

* To my mind, it means the maintenance of our own nation, the supremacy of the **British** Empire in the Pacific and elsewhere - in other words the paramountcy, of the Power to which we belong.

* As a matter of fact, the Japanese Navy in the recent war was simply a replica of the **British** Navy, composed of, the same class of vessel, and under the same system of training.

* 1 I advocated the Imperial idea and assistance to the **British** Navy llong before many on the Ministerial bench ever uttered Imperialistic thoughts.

* The Prime Minister told us that the **British** money lender would beonly too pleased to lend us what we require.

* It is stated that this difference is justified by quality, but in spite of the superior quality of the English glass the lower prices of the Belgian article have led to the importation of very much larger quantities from Belgium, to the corresponding exclusion of the **British** manufactures.

* that the officer, who was sent bythe **British** Government to watch events in Japan, has recommended that bayonets be dispensed with in the Imperial Army Before any expenditure isentered upon in reference to bayonets, the Government ought to fully investigate the matter; because it will be of no use our incurring liabilities for the supply of bayonetsunless the Imperial Forces arearmed with the same weapon.

* Notwithstanding 'the fact that all the offshoots of Great Britain were trained in free-trade views, and had a natural love for **British** ideas, in every case but one they have adopted protection, and not thrown it over.

* If the **British** Government will take the necessary steps to remove these depressing and oppressive charges, the iron industry will be revived to its old magnitude at the very least.

* That a return be laid upon the table of the House showing, as nearly as can be ascertained, the number of Chinese and Japanese respectively resident in the Commonwealth, who have become naturalized **British** subjects.

* I am anxious that the House should deal this evening with the Senate's amendments in the Sea-Carriage of Goods Bill and in the Papua (**British** New 
The point is that we have already alienated large areas of Crown lands in the Territory.

* I hope that the Prime Minister will carry out his intention of ascertaining the area of land in **British** New Guinea, which is suitable for settlement, its situation, and the purposes to which it could  profitably  be devoted.

* I do not think there is an honorable member in this House - I do not think there are very many men in this country - who have any other feelings than those of strong loyalty to the **British** Empire.

* But we have lived that kind of thing down long ago, and there is certainly a growing feeling, which is just as well responded to amongst the most extreme democrats in the community as it is by those who call themselves conservatives, in favour of attachment and loyalty to the **British** Empire.

* Surely the mere form of the Bill is not going to create difficulty with the **British** Government.

* I believe that it is our loyalty to the Empire, and the supreme conviction that it is the destiny of the **British** Empire to rule in these southern seas that has prompted us to this drastic kind of legislation.

* It is the strong conviction of the people of these States that we are to hold this continent for the **British** people - it is that strong feeling of Imperial loyalty that has led to this kind of legislation.

* There is no active, political, or national feeling against the aggregation of **British** firms into powerful corporations.

* At the proper time I shall be prepared to support moderately reduced duties upon certain **British** imports, but I am not prepared to support higher duties than those which I have recommended against the whole world.

* I think there is a concensus of opinion among naval authorities that it would, be cheaper and more effective fr Australia to provide at least a portion of our own coastal defences, thus allowing the **British** ships absolute freedom.

* If 1 thought that a contribution to the **British** Navy would be a better plan than the expenditure of a like amount on our own navy- 
Inasmuch as this amendment applies to all **British** and foreign vessels, I think that if it is agreed' to, the passing of the Bill will have to be delayed until the King's assent has been obtained.

* By-the-bye, our friends who will not allow the **British** subjects of the Indian Empire to be employed on the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's steamers are proposing to amend the terms of our land mail contracts in order to permit of our own coloured people being employed in connexion with them.

* It is an act of State, and might well be regarded as an act of war committedby the **British** Empire against a friendly power.

* I could not speak as to that, and I was justified in that attitude, inasmuch as I had heard him deny an accusation brought against him at Waratah that he was a pro-Boer who had expressed the hope that our **British** troops would be defeated in South Africa.

* Then it is put fairly enough that the Belgians are underselling the **British** by about 30 per cent., and that in point of fact where **British** goods would cost 100 the Belgian goods would cost only 70.

* The Prime Minister stated, that of the 250,000,000 owing by the States to the **British** creditors, about 150,000,000 bears interest, and the balance of 100,000,000 is non-interest bearing.

* The New Hebrides should be the warden of **British** interests in the Pacific.

* I understand that he is personally acquainted with its .soundings and formation, and is of opinion that it should be under **British** control.

* Where should we be had we to protect ourselves against foreign aggression, if we had not the support of the **British** Fleet?

* In view of the fact that the Orient Steamship Company is under contract to carry the mails of the Commonwealth to London, how is it that the steamships of the said company when at sea, and when travelling between Australian ports, accept letters for transmission in the ships' letter-boxes, such letters being stamped with **British** and not Australian postage stamps?

* Did not the **British** Government, some time ago, express readiness to establish penny postage from Great Britain to Australia, irrespective of the rate prevailing between Australia and Great Britain ?

* That the Commonwealth, profoundly rejoicing in the restoration of peace, most cordially congratulates the **British** Government and people upon its attainment, with fervent hopes for the unity and prosperity of South Africa.

* A person resident in the Commonwealth, nob being a **British** subject, and not being an aboriginal native of Asia, Africa, or the Islands of the Pacific, excepting New Zealand, who intends to settle in the Commonwealth, and who - 
Whether the Government has considered the important bearing which the opening of the Panama Canal will have upon the value of the New Hebrides Islands to Australian and **British** trade in the Pacific?

* - -The Prime Minister must remember that the provision in regard to the manning of **British** ships with white seamen was indorsed by the Senate, with the qualification that it should not be brought into, operation until August next.

* I wish todifferentiate in favour of Great Britain', and therefore I have proposed a duty of 10 per cent, on importations from all other places, allowing **British** importations to come in free.

* I am alluding toPapua or **British** New Guinea.

* As far as the naval subsidy is concerned, I- wish to say that the Agreement has never been observed by the **British** Government since its consummation.

* The whole question is about to be considered, not merely with reference to certain classes of goods, but affecting the **British** marine, by a Navigation Conference, which will be held at the beginning of next year in London.

* All the **British** Possessions will be represented, and an endeavour will be made to arrive at uniformity of treatment in connexion with **British** shipping.

* The question how to encourage .Britishers to serve on **British** ships will also come before the Conference.

* Is the Commonwealth Government still publishing alluring advertisements in **British** newspapers in order to attract settlers?

* Is the Commonwealth backing up schemes promoted by (**British** syndicates with funds; and, if so, to what extent?

* I am glad to assure my honorable friend that this Bill will not be permitted to debar the efficient training of the  personnel  of the new naval unit to the highest standard of the **British** Navy.

* As the honorable member for Parramatta has said, our duty is not so much with regard to the small white population of **British** New Guinea as with regard to the aboriginal inhabitants.

* It is a great pity that we ever allowed any part of the island of New Guinea to go out of **British** control.

* But I should prefer that the foot of white man had never been placed within **British** New Guinea than that the black inhabitants should be completely annihilated by the introduction of what has proved in the past to be a most potent factor in the obliteration of native races.

* The whole cry now is that the white man has reached the stage when he is absolutely useless, and it is urged that we must not interfere with the **British** subject.

* The imposition of a high Tariff on these articles, which will lead to their manufacture in Australia, is one way in which we can help **British** sons and daughters to emigrate to Australia.

* His Majesty the King, His Majesty's Government, and **British** people have received with much satisfaction resolutions of Commonwealth Parliament conveying cordia congratulations on termination of war.

* But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland.

* I have ascertained that when the Bill is in Committee I shall be able to move an amendment dealing with **British** goods alone.

* Item 73 (a), revolvers, pistols, air guns, &amp;c,  ad valorem  (**British**) 15 per cent., (other) 22 per cent.

* The  Daily Mail  to-day publishes the results of some inquiries amongst **British** manufacturers and exporters into the probable effect of Australia's new Tariff upon **British** exports to the Commonwealth.

* Does he think the effects therein indicated will tend to reassure the **British** public of the genuineness of the present Government's professions of a desire to give Great Britain a substantial advantage in preferential trade?

* The other items in the division are 1,000 as expenses in connexion with delimitation of **British** Papua - that is, the Boundary Commission - an honorarium of 50 to the chief clerk of the Audit Office for visiting Papua officially, and 50 as salary of surveyor, the last-mentioned to be recovered.

* Of these the honorarium to the chief clerk and the salary of the surveyor were voted last year, leaving only the other two items, " Towards the expenses of Administration " and " Expenses in connexion with delimitation of **British** Papua."

* Every year a number of pensioners leave the **British** service in India.

* They include some of the flower of the **British** Army.

* That fact is clearly shown in the memorandum that was submitted by the delegates sent to England to confer with the Imperial authorities when the Constitution Bill was before the **British** Parliament.

* But I do not think that the attraction of the United States has had much influence, because I take it for granted that **British** people, .on removing from the old land, would prefer to go to a country under **British** rule.

* Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Scandinavia, and the **British** Islands.

* A mere sprinkling of people, numbering fewer than 5,000,000- 
On behalf of the labour party he wished to say that he had no objection to a number of **British** white people coming here to make homes for themselves and to assist in the development of Australia.

* I would sooner have a white man than a black man at any time, and I think we can point with pride to the manner in which **British** seamen have acted in times of shipwreck.

* I find that copies of **British** treaties and alliances are obtained regularly from the Colonial Office, and are filed in the Department of External Affairs in connexion with the papers to which they belong.

* I wish to inform the House that  Mr. McArthur,  a Member of the **British** House of Commons, being in the city, I have, anticipating the wish of honorable members, invited him to take a seat on the floor of the chamber.

* The proportion is about the same, and the volubility of members of the Australian Parliament is by no means less than is that of the members of the **British** Parliament.

* What has the honorable member to say about some workers who earn twice as much as do **British** workers, and spend all their wages in drink, and do not pay their debts?

* Is it a fact that the effect of this instruction was that the Sydney  Bulletin  could get its **British** super calendered paper in free, instead of at15 per cent., under the Tariff?

* press of Australia is no better and no worse than the press of other parts of the **British** Empire ; but I cannot ignore the fact that our newspapers are commercial concerns which, in some of .

* The members of the Brisbane branch of the **British** Medical Association were so' aggressively respectable that, when I talked with them in reference to my candidature, they said - " We don't know whether we ought to shake hands with you, doctor, seeing that you have announced yourself as a labour candidate."

* It has reference to certain action which was taken by the Brisbane branch of the **British** Medical Association, but does not relate to my connexion with that organization.

* That incident occurred in connexion with the **British** Medical Association.

* Earl Jersey, whose remarks have been quoted to the contrary, himself says, amongst other things, that - undoubtedly there have been a good many criticisms of Australia written in the press, which have had the effect, to a certain extent, of pulling down Australia in the minds of the **British** people.

* But for our being a portion of the **British** Empire we should find ourselves compulsorily much more heavily taxed in order to provide, amongst other things, for our own protection.

* I was very much struck on reading the report of a **British** Consul on the Continent of Europe by the statement that the English manufacturer has failed utterly to take the advantages which belong to him, and has lost his market by declining to pack his goods in the manner considered to be most suitable by those who wish to purchase such goods.

* Itwould completely shut out all the imports of the **British** Oil Company which have a flash point of less than 102 degrees.

* I need scarcely point out that that test is four degrees above the flash point of the **British**- Asiatic Company's oils.

* Has the Minister representing the Prime Minister received any communication from the Imperial authorities with reference to the providing of Australian remounts for the **British** Army  1 
I understand that the Minister's proposal is to allow goods from the United Kingdom, although thev are not being carried in **British** shins, to come in at the old rates.

* Thev say that the **British** Navy should deal with everything.

* - I hope that the Treasurer will consent to give a preference to **British** tool handles.

* One very simple answer to that inquiry is that if such a provision were ' embodied in our law, shippers would probably insure, not with Australian companies, but with **British** companies.

* But it does touch the substance, because under the Naturalization Act, the **British** subjects mentioned by the honorable member for North Sydney are practically the only people who will be benefited.

* Did the- honorable member ever know a **British** soldier' go to war without being paid?

* A more degrading position was never occupied by a Ministry in any **British** Legislature.

* A similar standing order has, been passed in the **British** Parliament, in our own Senate, in the United States Congress, and in most of the States' Parliaments.

* The matter of getting the ships as far as possible ' manned by white **British** labour.

* Indeed, the other day he carried this defence so far as to say that he had been misreported even in the case of a paragraph read to him from the latest **British** Blue-book.

* But a considerable change has taken place since then, and although I have not yet absolutely determined how my vote shall be cast in the matter of the proposed subsidy, I do say that when we read the utterances of one party in the **British** Government - utterances which are calculated to plunge Great Britain into industrial war with other nations - it becomes us to seriously consider our position.

* A political party in England at the present time assert that they are likely to ask a large section of the **British** people to join with them in carrying out a certain policy.

* A remark was made on Tuesday afternoon as to the advisability of following the practice of the **British** Parliament in regard to matters which are not provided for in our standing orders, and our first standing order provides that - 
It will be seen therefore that the practice of the **British** Parliament is to be followed only in cases not provided for by our own rules, and as the occasions when members, including Ministers, may speak are provided for, we are not in this instance thrown back upon that practice.

* If it were not for the supremacy of Great Britain, if the **British** Navy were to lose the command of the seas, Australia would not be in a position to defend herself.

* Our real naval defence is the **British** Navy.

* So far as the Postmaster-General has been at present able to ascertain, the **British** Government have not at any time expressed such readiness, but inquiry will be further instituted.

* Whether the Fiji Islands are included amongst those **British** Islands in the Pacific with which the Constitution gives authority to the Commonwealth to eventually deal ?

* I am quite sure that any proposal under which the State Treasurers will merely be substituted for the **British** bondholders will be absolutely boycotted by the people.

* Both are made in  highly specialized **British** engineering establishments, Great Britain making better machines of this kind than are made elsewhere in the world.

* Is there any record that Francisco Ferrer, who was recently executed by the Spanish Government at Barcelona, Spain, was a naturalized **British** subject in the Commonwealth or the States?

* AVe are told that the Government acted in  subservence  to a **British** Minister - that we adopted the policy we did in this Act because of an intimation received from that Minister.

* Senator O'Connor,  in replying to a question, seems to have made a mistake in saying or implying that there would be a direct exclusion of aliens, while there would be an educational test applied tocoloured people who were **British** subjects.That was not the policy of the Government as laid down in the Bill ; and the matter escaped my attention, or I should have pointed out the provisions to  Senator O'Connor.

* Honorable members are continually saying that the condition of the **British** workman is' worse than it was many years ago.

* The **British** quarantine procedure, it will be seen, is eminently suited to modern requirements.

* There does not seem to be any clear evidence that the Boers were caught wearing the uniform of the **British** army, so that that point is still in doubt.

* There can be no official information in this matter so far as I can see, and for this reason: All these men were serving in an Imperial corps under the regulations of the **British** army, and as soldiers of that army.

* I suggest that we shouldtake an example from the administration of the **British** Government at Hongkong, where any ' shipping company captain, or agent, who introduces an undesirable immigrant is liable to a fine of at least100.

* The fact that the **British** settlers in the New Hebrides have not as good a chance of succeeding as have the French settlers there is due to the more generous treatment of the latter by their own Government.

* England is more generous to **British** settlers in the New Hebrides than France is to her settlers there.

* Under the Queensland Act, which was passed only this year, Chinese or other Asiatics, whether **British** subjects or naturalized or not, and aboriginal natives of Australia, Africa, the islands of the Pacific or New Zealand, are excluded.

* Under the Victorian Act Chinese or other Asiatics, whether **British**, subjects or not, and aboriginal natives of any State of the Commonwealth or of New Zealand are excluded.

* It will be generally admitted that that definition covers most of the residents in **British** New Guinea.

* Section 2 of the Ordinance says - 
Item 122 (f), paper, strawboard (**British**),1s.

* I do not know whether the equipment to which he refers is of foreign or of **British** manufacture.

* I can assure the Minister that the mining population of **British** New Guinea is very much dissatisfied with the manner in which the administration of the Territory has been conducted.

* Mr.McDONALD.- When these persons, are about tobe appointed, I think that' their names should be laid upon the table of the House, so as to allow us to obtain some expression of opinion from the white residents of **British** New Guinea as to whether their appointment would prove acceptable.

* Although some honorable members have complained that we pay too dearly for our sugar, according to  Mulhall,  in i8ii, and again in 1820, the **British** duty on sugar was 27 a ton,, and the price of the commodity 90 per ton in the firstnamed year, and 63 per ton in the second, while as late as 1890 the French taxation was 3s.

* As yet we have really done nothing to show that we, as descendants of the grand old **British** stock, are prepared to share in the tremendous cost of defence, which is now such a heavy burden on th **British** taxpayer.

* We may depend upon it that in this very early stage of the history of Australia, when we have to some extent consolidated ourselves as a branch of the great **British** Empire, all those great nations which have been suffering for years from earth hunger, are watching very carefully through their consuls and representatives the attitude which the Australian .

* This is a very great responsibility ; and when I hear men talk, not carelessly perhaps, but as if they could' not see beyond the limits of their own particular locality, I cannot help thinking that it does not bid fair for our future if we should be thrown upon our own resources instead of nestling snugly under the broad wing: of the **British** Empire.

* The laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all **British** ships, the Queen's ships of war excepted.

* We should be prevented from performing a very large number of the functions ordinarily performed by every **British** Government, if it were different.

* If it were otherwise, all **British** procedure and precedent would be wrong, and we should have t.o create a new practice for ourselves.

* On the whole, I think this matter should await the decision of the  question now pending as to the future of **British** New Guinea.

* But the **British** creditor advanced that money upon the distinct^ understanding that it was to be devoted-20 carrying out specific works.

* It was held in the Ah Toy case that noperson who is not a **British** subject can claim the right to enter Australia.

* If any of the agreements made have been entered into beyond the limits of the **British** Empire, are they legal and enforceable instruments within the Commonwealth?

* And, judging by what we know df **British** politics, it will not be long before there is a land tax which will have to be added to the price.

* I am told that the Swiss have a traditionary skill in this trade, just as the **British** have in producing some sorts of cutlery.

* 266  Visit of **British** Fleet.

* He also thinks you should insist on South Africa to Australia cable being made all **British**.

* He also made mention of the decline of **British** seamen.

* There is, of course, the question of Imperial defence, and I am not sure that in this regard the Imperial Government should not take steps to see whether it would not be worth while to make sea service more attractive to the **British** people, in order to give Britishers the training necessary to make them available for purposes of defence in time of war.

* Clause 14 (Arrangements may be made for **British** or foreign mails).

* I wish first to point out that it is divided into two parts, the first of which is practically a transcript of the Merchandise Marks Act of Great Britain, which has effect throughout the **British** dominions, while the second contains provisions relating to the imports and exports of the Commonwealth, and gives power to compel the placing of a proper description on goods or on packages containing them.

* I sincerely hope that his efforts will be attended with success, because, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the **British** workman stands to win more from his than from any other proposal.

* The **British** Labour Party has never really had the case properly put before it.

* In the time of Cobden the **British** Labour Party considered it a matter of life and death to fight for a free breakfast table, and failed to see that they were throwing away their wages in order to secure that end.

* It is positively appalling to see the degraded state of the so-called **British** workman under a policy which was adopted in order that he might secure a cheap supply of food.

* When a **British** Dependency can gain no preference in the home market over the foreigner, one cannot be surprised if such a state of affairs leads to a certain degree of discontent, if not of rebellion in some cases.

* Britain is no longer the iron king, and the supremacy of **British** engineering establishments and ship-yards is threatened.

* I ask whether  Mr. Chamberlain  is trying to deceive the **British** public, and, if not, what offer has been made by the Government?

* Of **British** goods we imported in  1905 ,10,694  worth, and in  1906 15,033  worth ; while of foreign goods we imported in  1905 6,281  worth, and in  1906 ,8,801  worth.

* In order to save timeI may inform the House that in the **British** Parliament the practice is, on such occasions, for reference to be allowed in Committee of Supply to any parallel debate in Committee of Ways and Means, and  viae  versd.

* I voted with the " Ayes," because I desired that those words should stand - that we should recognise the sincere desire manifested by the **British** Parliament to do justice to Ireland.

* Our present contribution towards the **British** navy is about 7d.

* As a matter of fairness, I do not think we should draw a Une of preference between **British** manufacturers and foreign manufacturers.

* I hope that the Minister will say what has been done regarding the delimitation of the boundaries of the **British**, Dutch, and German territories.

* I have forwarded an invitation for the **British** Navy to be specially represented during the period in question, but have not received any reply.

* Whether such a discrimination is considered conducive to the friendly relationship which should exist between **British** Dominions and Possessions ?

* If the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney is adopted it will apply to **British** born subjects.

* It is an ordinary principle of **British** justice that a person shall be held innocent of an offence until he is proved guilty.

* That will be bringing the' Bill, I think, into line with the ordinary **British** practice.

* There may be a time when it will be necessary for the naval squadron to be withdrawn from Sydney, if we leave its control - as it is at the present time - in the hands of **British** officers, and entirely directed by the **British** Admiralty.

* The title suggested by members was " Sovereign Lord of the **British** Realms
                beyond Seas."

* I see no reason for not following the practice of the **British** Army on a similar occasion in Australia.

* Report on **British** New Guinea, for year ended 30th June, 1905.

* Item136E - Dynamite (**British**), free, (other),  ad valorem,  10 per cent.

* Are the following statements correct, asquite recently made by the editor of the  **British** Australasian :  - 

 Mr. Stead has been refused admission into the Transvaal, Will he endeavour to find out whether that statement is absolutely correct, or is merely a newspaper statement?

* If it is correct, will he also ascertain whether  Mr. Stead  happens to be a **British** subject ?

* Imagine a statesman like Gladstone, who, after fighting for Liberalism in the **British** constituencies was defeated in the House of Commons by his great antagonist, Disraeli, who practically stole his liberal clothes - imagine him turning round on the pledges which he had given to supporters, and joining hands with his antagonist to effect some other purpose or to gain some other end.

* I should like to read another quotation from the  **British** Australasian.

* Some legislation in the right direction was passed, and until recently it was thought that the **British** workman had secured a much greater degree of liberty than was enjoyed during the period referred to by Professor Thorold Rogers.

* Compare that with the result of the Commission of Inquiry quoted by  Sir John  Gorst in connexion with the schools of Edinburgh, which is called the Athens of the **British**-speaking world, and whose educational system is supposed to be absolutely the highest under the **British** flag.

* That was the infamy branded upon the Athens of the **British** Empire, although Scotland, in her treatment of the woman and the child, stands pre-eminent over England, Ireland, and Wales.

* I wish to know from the Treasurer if steps have been taken to have Commonwealth stock placed upon the list of **British** trust investments, so that that stock, when issued, may not be at a disadvantage as compared with State stock?

* Clause 14 (Arrangements may be made, for **British** or foreign mails).

* Honorable members will know that the principle of a minimum wage has been adopted by the London County Council, a large number of municipal councils all over the world, and the **British** House of Commons.

* So far back as 1893, when  Mr. Campbell  Banuerman - now leader of the Opposition - was a responsible Minister, and was speaking in the name ofthe Government, he said - 
The self-governing Dominions can best help us, not by spending  ^'2,000,000  in the construction of battleships to serve in **British** quarters, but by making  efforts  to defend themselves.

* The loyalty of **British** ship-owners does not extend to employing **British** crews.

* The proportion of foreigners in **British** ships grows apace.

* Last official year saw the desertion of 12,000 men, and in one year there was a total unauthorized exodus o* 27,000 men from **British** ships.

* He believes in the all-sufficient protection afforded Australia, in common with other parts of the Empire, by the **British** Navy.

* He was satisfied to reiterate time and again, first, that the **British** Navy was never more powerful than it is to-day ; and, secondly, that we have always acted in a very niggardly fashion in not contributing more than 200,000 a year towards its maintenance.

* Evidently he did not know what was coming when he uttered these words - 
There was a time not so very long ago when so jealous was the feeling in the minds of the Imperial authorities as to their colonial possessions, that the last thing in the world a **British** Minister would have dreamt of proposing would have been any sort of partnership between the ; Imperial Government and the **British** dependencies, whether for military or naval purposes.

* A much happier phase has now come over the relations between the **British** Government and the other governing bodies in the Empire upon this and many other important questions, and we now find the Imperial authorities profoundly eager to draw us all into partnership, whilst on the part of the self-governing States of the Empire there is a profound disinclination to adopt that course.

* He congratulated us upon the progressive spirit which now marks the **British** Government, pointing out that in times gone by it had viewed with distrust efforts by -the Colonies to launch out on their own; that the Mother Country was now only too desirous to see her children fast arriving at years of discretion take upon themselves the responsibilities of manhood.

* He would have us believe, that everything is well with the **British** Empire ; that there is no fear of war ; that we may securely fold our arms, and rest in peace under the aegis of the mightiest fleet that the world has ever seen.

* At the present time the **British** fleets are being drawn closer and ever closer to Great Britain.

* To-day, except for the Mediterranean squadron, all the **British** warships are within a stone's throw of Great Britain, encircling with a triple Avail of steel, the island's which are the heart of the Empire.

* Germany has gone on steadily building a navy, and to-day, as every one knows, under Admiral Fisher's  regime,  **British** warships - except those few at our doors - have been withdrawn from the uttermost parts of the earth, to be concentrated in the narrow seas surrounding the **British** Isles, to guard them from invasion.

* There can be no earthly doubt that the present allocation of the **British** Navy is a complete admission of the fact that it now takes the might of that great fleet merely to conserve the heart of the Empire itself.

* No **British** politician wants war with Germany.

* Australia has hitherto relied, and she reliesstill, upon the protection of the **British** Navy.

* Suppose an attack from one of these ports upon Sydney ; and allow that our fleets and those of the enemy start simultaneously, Sydney wouk have the enemy at its doors and on its hands for 17, 24, and 23 days respectively before the **British** Navy came in.

* The enforced concentration of **British** battle-fleets in Home waters has radically altered the situation of Australia in war, and has seriously altered it for the worse.

* I should  rather  say that fifty years hence the predominance of the **British**  fla?

* All the naval power of the **British** Empire cannot suffice ultimately to save  a  remote community which neither breeds men in plenty nor freely imports them.

* The right honorable member for East Sydney relies on the **British** Navy, and holds the opinion that there is no necessity to resort to compulsion, the present means of defence being ample to protect us.

* It is clear that by the readjustment of the **British** Fleet there is in the whole of the Pacific only the Australian Squadron, which consists of one firstclass protected cruiser, two second-class, five third-class, and two small ships unclassified.

* The right honorable member for East Sydney spoke of there being no danger of invasion, and in this connexion I should like to quote from Colonel Gaedke, a German military authority, who, speaking on the position of France and Germany in the case of war, says - 
We find that, as a matter of fact, that policy was pursued a century ago by Great Britain in regard to Denmark, who, because she declined neutrality, was bombarded by the **British** Fleet, and reduced to terms.

* However great an authority he may be on other subjects, he cannot be regarded as an authority on military questions, and I shall beg leave to accept as correct the opinion of the military correspondent of the  Times  that the right honorable member in this matter does not know what he is speaking about - that he is ignoring the most patent facts - that he is overlooking the withdrawal of the **British** Fleets from the outermost posts of the Empire to the narrow waters around Great- Britain herself.

* With us there is a general recognition that Great Britain herself is in danger, that consequently every portion of the Empire is, and* that we can best perform our duty to the Empire by defending ourselves, and thus enabling the **British** Fleet to remain perfectly free to strike wherever the exigencies of the situation require it.

* The **British** Committee's report of the Swiss system, which was signed by all but five labour members, who, because of their official positions, did not feel able to join in a common report, says - 
That is compulsory service in time of war.

* I emphasize the point that this will be a revolution in **British** methods, and I most emphatically believe that we have good cause for making it.

* In saying that we shall impose a system which in its very nature is - I shall not say repugnant to the genius of the **British** people, for we have to remember that before our lifetime it was a common practice to recruit for the **British** Navy by press gangs - but something we have not experienced.

* Recruiting for the **British** Army is carried on at present with the most cruel compulsion ever known.

* It is the lash of starvation that drives into the **British** Army half its recruits.

* In support of this statement I have only to remind honorable members of the accounts published as to the degenerating physique of the recruits for the **British** Army.

* In the **British** Army, recruits are first instructed to march, and learn the preliminaries of drill, and then distributed throughout their respective regiments, whose efficiency is not impaired by their inclusion', while the recruits rapidly improve by their association with trained men.

* The **British** nation to-day is spending on naval defence three times what it spent twenty years ago.

* How much longer can the noble **British** taxpayer, for whom my right honorable friend was so sorry, and whom we assist to the extent of 200,000 a year - a contribution that cannot amount to more than d. or id.

* We prate about peace, and about the glorious might of the **British** Navy, we invent any excuse, we put forward any plausible lie, rather than do our plain duty.

* My deliberate opinion is that the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has made an improper use of this debate, because he went out of his way to make an unwarranted attack of an offensive character upon one of the ablest Ministers of the **British** Crown, and one of Australia's best friends.

* I am speaking of **British** guns.

* - That we could defend ourselves without the assistance of the **British** fleet? 
"

* Under this Bill, I understand, the word will not include other parts of the **British** Empire and the United Kingdom.

* - Insert the following new paragraph : -  " (h)  Guns or Rifles fitted with barrels which do not bear the **British** or other approved test mark ; or Such barrels imported separately - per doublebarrelled Gun or Rifle or barrel for such - per single-barrelled Gun or Rifle or barrel for such, each 5."

* In the case of biscuits, the Treasurer said that the reason he agreed to preference was that nearly the whole of the imports were of **British** manufacture.

* In the case of blue,it was shown that the whole of the imports were **British**; and yet,forthat  reason,  the Treasurer refused preference!

* But I cannot understand how a protectionist like the Treasurer can desire to impose a lower duty upon goods of **British** origin than upon those from foreign countries.

* Like all protectionists, he wishes to erect a fiscal barrier which shall be sufficiently high to exclude from Australia **British** goods, in common with foreign products.

* When the Treasurer was in England did he promise to reduce the duties upon goods of **British** manufacture and to ask for nothing by way of return?

* The very legislation that we have enacted to preserve a White Australia could not be enforced but for the **British** Navy.

* I hope to see the time when we shall have absolute free-trade between the various portions of the **British** Empire, and protection against the outside world.

* propose to deal with sailors upon **British** or foreign ships in this measure.

* Then I understand that the Government feel there is no question as to our constitutional power to place **British** and foreign ships which trade along our coast under the same conditions in regard to wages as Australian ships ?

* I understand the Prime Minister to say that in the Navigation Bill he proposes that foreign and **British** ships shall be subject to the same conditions as Australian ships in regard to our coastal trade?

* The laws of the Commonwealth are also "to be in force on all **British** ships, the Queen's ships of war excepted, whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth."

* Only last year the Lord Chancellor is reported upon page 181 of the  Law Reports  for 1902, appeal cases, to have said - 
**British** Empire must be of interest to us in Australia.

* The Boer officers, who kept the **British** Army at bay for a long time, were not men who had passed technical examinations.

* We cannot stop **British** subjects by an act of State.

* Cadbury's and other well-known **British** firms.

* The honorable member for Melbourne referred to the millionaire connexions of the oil companies, and I may say that the Colonial Oil Company, which is the Standard Oil Company under another name, and the **British** Imperial Company, which is a French-English company, both have associated with them millionaires - in the one case a Rockefeller, and in the other case a Rothschild.

* The amendment, as originally sent from the Senate, gave an advantage to the **British** Imperial Company, whereas the amendment before us would give an advantage to the Standard Oil Company.

* Had I voted for the amendment yesterday, I should have given assistance to the **British** Imperial Company, and if I vote to-day for the amendment unaltered, I shall be acting distinctly in the interests of the Standard Oil Company.

* The **British** Imperial Company import one illuminating oil for domestic purposes at 103. degrees and one engine oil flashing at 98 degrees.

* That proposal, however, would have admitted the **British** Imperial engine-oil without being denaturated, while the Standard Company's oil would have had to be treated.

* But to-day the proposal before us will cause the **British** Imperial oil to be denaturated, while the other oil would be admitted without treatment.

* The Standard Oil Company first fought the **British** Imperial Oil Company with a conditional rebate, which this Parliament declared to be illegal, and then the former company imported a cheaper and inferior kerosene, ostensibly for engine use ; but only the cases, and not the tins, were marked.

* It is neglect of this study that militates against **British** trade, and it is attention.

* I think that we had better not permit either the Standard Oil Trust  or the **British** Imperial Oil Company to obtain .a monopoly.

* We can stop anything of the kind where- the **British** flag flies.

* But it has to be a **British** test mark.

* It is hard to over-estimate the cost of the South African campaign to the **British** Government.

* agreement with every other part of the **British** Empire - an agreement by which the whole of those parts would be benefited as against other countries.

* But I am strongly of opinion that we should endeavour to secure the attainment of one comprehensive reciprocal agreement with every other part of the **British** Empire - such an agreement as would encourage production in  every part of- the Empire, so that we should be able to supply our own requirements, especially our food require ments, in the event of war.

* Not long ago the Straits Settlements - a **British** Crown colony - imported a dredge from Great Britain.

* The Melbourne firms tendered for their supply, but - owing to the delicate handling which the tables require in transport' - it was found that the freight charges from this city to Port Pirie would amount  fo 45-  -A- **British** firm which manufactures a table of the same kind, but of .a different pattern, secured the contract because it was able to ship them from the old country for two-fifths of the price involved in their transit from Melbourne to Port Pirie.

* Contrast the -methods of the **British** Government, confronted with a situation very similar to that of the Commonwealth Treasurer.

* We were led to believe that throughout the whole of the **British** Empire banners waved and a day was set apart for universal rejoicing over this, the latest and most happy effort of the Fusion Government - "A  Dreadnought  or its equivalent," and was an afterthought.

* AVe have had day after day from the protectionist side of the House what I may term the most unpatriotic allusions to the **British** Empire.

* One of these was a musical gentleman, who kept the one song going for 24 if not for 36 hours, and the refrain of his song was very much in this style - "Hingland, dear old Hingland, is a-goin' down the ill." I believed as much then in the truth of this gentleman's musical statement as I now believe in the correctness of the conclusions of honorable members on the Ministerial side of the House as to the decadence of the **British** Empire when compared with Germany and America.

* I- hope that something will be done to modify the measure, so as to permit **British**-born workmen to have a free entrance to these portions of the **British** dominions.

* If the Treasurer believes in his own policy he will have to agree to grant a preference to **British** manufacturers.

* As the **British** Government was in the act of handing over the administration of the Territory to the Commonwealth at the time of the acts complained of, it also disclaimed any liability, with the result that Captain Strachan could' obtain no redress.

* But I do not hold that that must necessarily be the outcome of our occupancy of **British** New Guinea.

* Some honorable members think that the barriers which we have raised against the importation of **British** manufactures should be lowered to give them a  fairer chance in the Australian market.

* Others strongly hold the view that those barriers should be increased against the products of foreign manufacturers with a view of assisting **British** trade.

* Many honorable ' members have urged that the duty should be reduced to 5 per cent, in the case of **British** imports, and to 10 per cent, as against foreign imports.

* In **British** New Guinea, one cannot ride a yard except along tracks which are cut for that purpose.

* Moreover, a patrol of policemen would have to be maintained along the boundary of the **British** and German Possessions.

* I find that although the actual importations of the nails included in paragraph  b  from the United Kingdom increased between 1903 and 1906, the percentage of the **British** importations to the total importation decreased.

* The Minister may not be aware that the **British** Association of Cotton Spinners, in Lancashire, are prepared to send experts to any part of the **British** Possessions for the purpose of giving information with regard to the production of cotton.

* It seems most peculiar that, after having received and accepted an invitation to attend the **British** naval manoeuvres, in June last - where he might have gained knowledge of the utmost value - he should suddenly have decided to hasten back to Australia.

* The invitation which was extended to him should have been regarded as a very great compliment to Australia, and it seems to me that in neglecting to avail himself of it, a slight, almost amounting to an insult, was offered to the **British** authorities.

* I do not intend to load this debate with too many details, but I may briefly allude to the position of South Australia and its Northern Territory, and the past management of the latter, and insist, from the stand-point of South Australia as a State, that something should be done either by the Federal Parliament, or by the **British** Parliament, to relieve the State of a liability, the importance of which it lias certainly never appreciated.

* The **British** Government agreed in 1863 to this extension of boundaries, after some little preliminary trouble, and the-passing of an Imperial Bill to alter the boundaries of the other colonies, Letters Patent in that year put the control of the whole of this tract of  country under,  or to use their own words, " annexed it " to South Australia.

* The Attorney-General also alluded to the fact that in Great Britain the circumstances and conditions are more similar to our own, and it was further indicated that the clauses dealing with this matter were to some extent a digest of the **British** Act.

* There is some similar provision in the **British** Act which, provides - 
I do not wish' to prolong the debate, but I have heard so much with regard to the dire results to the natives that are expected to follow the sale of intoxicants to white persons in **British** New Guinea, that I desire to say a word or two.

* seeing that in other parts of the Pacific Ocean, where the aborigines have come into contact with white men under **British** rule, effect has not been given to such an extreme proposal.

* In my opinion, if the people of Australia are to be protected they should be protected thoroughly ; and, therefore, this one-fourth, which represents **British** manufacture, is not worth consideration.

* I point out to the honorable member for Hunter that, according to general opinion, .the foreign condensed milk is better than the **British**; and, of course, a strong argument against the duty is that, while the Australian 'industry is being built up so as to cover the requirements of the whole Continent, we ought not to penalize the consumer.

* Two-thirds of our import trade is transacted with **British** Possessions, and, therefore, the Bill would operate mainly against those of our own flesh and blood who speak our own language.

* The Bill is of a most insulting character, in that it seeks to treat the people of our own race in a scurvy manner - a manner that we ourselves would be the first to resent if the people of the **British** nation were to legislate upon similar lines for the exclusion of Australian products from/ their markets.

* Being myself born in a Federation, knowing that Australia is an integral part of the **British** Empire, and being a thorough loyalist and believer in one' country, one King, one hope, one aspiration, and one destiny, I have advocated the **British** Empire going to war with Germany unless that country is prepared to submit to., disarmament, or to agree to arbitration, with a view to disarmament. '

* of the drills imported into the Commonwealth are of **British** origin.

* Prime Ministers in the **British** Parliament always occupy one of the highest and most responsible positions under the Crown.

* For the first time in the history of the English race and of **British** Parliaments, we find a Prime Minister degrading his position by bringing it down to one of humble servitude, and leaving himself without power.

* When the Prime Minister was in England, and the Attorney-General was acting for him, I suggested, during the discussion upon the Estimates of the proposed annual grant of 20,000 for the administration of **British** New Guinea, that the sale of Crown land there should be stopped, and he appeared to be in accord with me on the subject, but referred to the difficulty of inducing settlers to go to New Guinea if they could not purchase land there.

* Personally I do not think that we shall gain much by taking over **British** New Guinea, and to my mind the Territory will be a white elephant for many years to come.

* raised in order to give preference to **British**- goods.

* But the sacrifice of these men has done a great deal for the future of the **British** race-.

* That measure enacts that if **British** goods are sent here with intent to injure by means of unfair competition Australian trade, or whose importation will probably result in creating a substantial disorganization of Australian industry, their importation .mav be prohibited, while they may be liable to confiscation under certain conditions.

* In view of those restrictions, we must give some better proof than the proposals of the Government as they stand of our  bona fides,  and I think that the small concession which I suggest will be regarded by the **British** people as an attempt towards the realization of the Imperial idea outlined by  Mr. Chamberlain,  and supported so eloquently by the Prime Minister, which we all desire to see brought about.

* In 1903, the **British** imports were 89.3 per cent, of the whole, leaving a little over 10 per cent, of imports from abroad ; and in 1906, the **British** imports amounted to 80.3 per cent, and the foreign imports to 19.7 per cent.

* But it seems extraordinary that we of the **British** Empire, who pride ourselves on being in advance of other nations- in our economic progress, have never taken properly into consideration the great German system which has worked so satisfactorily, and which, so far as I know, is the nearest approach to a universal system to.be found in the world.

* I think it was Prince Bismarck who, in 1881, introduced and passed the first measure of old-age pensions in Germany, which approximated to some extent to the systems now in force in the **British** Dominions.

* Australian and **British** history teach us that we can well rely upon the intelligence, integrity, and honour of **British** Judges.

* done, but because some of the greatest names in Australian history have been placed atthe heads of prospectuses, and, as a result, widows and orphans have been induced to withdraw their money from **British** Consols, and to invest it in Australian securities in connexion with which they have been plundered.

* That is why the **British** people have lost confidence in us.

* There is absolutely nothing to justify our departure from the time-honoured practice which has been followed in the State Parliaments of Australia, and also in the **British** Parliament.

* I admit with the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, that our Constitution does not specifically restrict us to that particular practice ; but I submit that the Constitution has to be read with the recognised practice of the State Parliaments of Australia, and of the **British** Parliament.

* In an American newspaper the other day a **British** soldier declared that the **British** guns are now obsolete.

* The earnings of **British** ships absorb one-half of that very large total, and that is doubtless the reason why America, France, and German)' are turning their attention to this all-important branch of commerce and trade.

* per month must impel the owners of these steamers to replace **British** seamen more and more by coolie labour, o 
.- If it is expedient to pass a measure of this kind, it is certainly desirable that it should be made effective in its application.

* As has been so well and ably presented by previous speakers, this Bill proposes to ask persons, who may be absolutely guiltless, to proffer information, which may incriminate them ; and even if those who are suspected be guilty, I hold that such a procedure is contrary to **British** law.

* Many years have elapsed since **British** troops have had to face troops so highly trained to fight under the particular circumstances which confront them in action there.

* Yes ; in reply to a question telegraphed by the  **British** Australasian,  a newspaper published in London.

* What is your **British** babe - he wants to fight from the
                very start.

* If the **British** had not allowed him to get his supplies of coal in Hong
                Kong before he was ordered to clear out under a sort of understood veiled threat
                business, where would the Americans have been at Manilla ?

* During the last eighteen months or two years the **British** Empire has been engaged in a war in South Africa, which has been a disastrous one inmany ways ; disastrous to many a military reputation, and disastrous to many preconceived ideas of military tactics.

* I, personally, did not expect very much from theFederal Government, but, nevertheless, I thought they would do something better in thisdirection than mighthave been hoped for from the **British** War Office.

* The figures that have come to hand since the agitation first arose indicate that the **British** Fleet shows such a margin, even over the two-power standard, that we may rest content that Great Britain is not likely for a day or two to be in danger.

* There are gentlemen who, at the time of the scare, expressed themselves strongly in favour of the Commonwealth presenting a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Government, but who are now ready to admit that we took up the right stand.

* There is another feature about that Act which is insulting to the **British** Empire and to the spirit of Imperial unity.

* Furthermore,  Mr. Reid  has announced that he will fight against the proposals of the Government to hamper **British** coastal trade in Australian waters by certain provisions in the Navigation Bill, and that he will resist the inordinate interference of the Federal Government with the employes of the State Governments by the provisions of an Arbitration Bill.

* He said that we were bound by the ordinary rules of procedure, by the procedure of the House of Commons, and by the practice of **British** parliamentary institutions.

* But in no **British** dominion is there any means provided by which the Senate could reach a further stage of 'the Bill than they have done at the present time, and still, send requests to us regarding amendments in the Tariff.

* I do not suppose that the honorable member for Maranoa will think that any of these men were subjected to any treatment which a **British** soldier would not have been subjected to, or that in the method of trial they were treated in any way other thun as **British** soldiers.

* In that trade, therefore, without the aid of any preference, Great Britain enjoys an advantage of 75*354 Further, we import from the mother country 104,739 worth of cutlery ; whereas our foreign importations are valued at only .22,256 ; showing an excess in favour of **British** trade of 82,483.

* Among the -experts who were present at the consultations which preceded the drawing up of this agreement was the **British** Director of Naval Intelligence, who.

* The united control of the **British** fleets is its cardinal principle, and to defeat that principle would be to defeat the agreement in its most essential  point.

* If we had English conditions here - if we had an enormous body of troops, if those troops consisted principally of permanent men, if we had at our command a body of officers' possessed of the experience and ability of officers of the **British** Army, if we had the tremendous range of ability that they have, if we had officers who were constantly getting experience in border wars all over the Empire - there might be some reason for following English precedents here.

* The serious decrease that has taken place in the number of **British** sailors in our mercantile marine is sufficient to make us pause and think.

* The number of **British** seamen during those forty years increased from 157,112 to 175,532.

* In1860 the **British** mercantile marine employed 14,280 foreigners and 335 lascars, whereas in 1890 their numbers had increased to 36,893 foreigners and 36,023 lascars, or a total of 72,916.

* In other words, the proportion of foreigners and lascars to **British** seamen in1860 was 9.3 per cent., whereas in 1900 it was 41.78 per cent.

* The fact that the number of lascars engaged in the **British** mercantile marine has increased from 335 to 36,023 during the past forty years should be taken into consideration.

* I admit that the **British** Government have not made a similar proposal, but they are in a different position.

* I have little sympathy with the **British** Imperial Oil Trust, whether it is or is not run by the Rothschilds.

* - On 3rd August, the honorable member for Moreton, speaking upon the motion for the adjournment of the House, drew attention to a paragraph reprinted in the Brisbane  Daily Mail  from a Sydney newspaper, in which it was stated that a traveller in South Africa had seen a number of small crosses, with the inscription, " Here lies a **British** Soldier," piled up against the side of a smithy, neai the burial-ground, and was informed, on inquiry, that they were sent to South Africa by the Australian Government, to be placed at the heads of the graves.

* 4. letter has now been received from  Mrs. R.  Campbell McEwan, the honorary graves secretary of the Guild of the Loyal Women of South Africa, with extracts from the  Rand Daily Mail  in explanation, which is, briefly, as follows:' - After the conclusion of hostilities, the Guild of Loyal Women called for tenders for the erection of iron crosses over the graves of those who fell on the **British** side during the war.

* So strongly was I impressed with the idea that this indus-  try might become an important source of revenue, that, some three years ago, I placed myself in communication with what is known as the **British** Cotton Growing Association in Lancashire.

* That association originated with a number of cottonspinners of Lancashire, who, in the first instance, contributed sums amounting in the aggregate to 50,000 ; but, so desirous werethey to render **British** cottonspinners independent of even the American supply, that they subsequently subscribed over 500,000, which has been diverted principally in an Egyptian direction.

* The Imperial Defence Committee recommended its abolition on the ground that in **British** ports it was being superseded by submarines and submersibles.

* In the first place, although the **British** Government have done away with submarine mines, because their ships are constantlyusing home ports, the German Government, who have to fear enemies on their coast, are going in more than ever for submarine mining defence.

* The proposals which the Government have seemed to accept, namely, that we should assure only in Australian societies, suggests to me the fact that it is our own fault that these large **British** and American companies are not Australian societies.

* I do not like to use the word " foreign " in respect of **British** societies for instance, because I suppose that would be obnoxious even to a Victorian protectionist, and I will  speak  of them as " outside " societies.

* Yes ; but the same argument is equally applicable to the **British** possessions.

* He says - 
I contend that in affording similar facilities the Commonwealth is giving a handsome endowment to the **British** Navy.

* We do not care to seethe colonists, as it were, hiring **British** ships at so much per ton per annum to guard their shores.

* Some of our local naval forces were sent to China during the recent war, and we have the evidence of the officers who were in charge of the contingents that they proved themselves to be equal to the **British** sailors in the work which they had .

* Whether we pay the subsidy or not, I presume that the **British** Navy, in the interests of Great Britain herself, will be prepared to protect us.

* Of course, we should require **British** officers.

* I know that it is urged that we are going to place a, number of our own men on these vessels, and to pay them at a higher rate than is proposed to be allowed to the **British** sailors.

* Imagine two sets of men working on the same ships under the same officers-- 
Australian rates are those actually paid to the permanent men in Victoria, while the highest **British** rates quoted are above anything I can find in the navy list.

* It is also worth While to note the following rates in the **British** Navy.

* I thought there was to be an allowance, in addition to everything which the **British** seamen receive.

* The **British** Merchant Shipping Act and the State Acts control navigation in our waters, but probably the honorable member's question will call the attention of the State authorities to this matter.

* Before that event, any public man who said that the **British** militarry authorities were lax in their control or discipline, or lacking in ability, would have been scouted, and there would have been a -demand for his suspension from the nearest tree.

* The lesson of the Boer war was a timely one to the **British** Empire, and every year since then, leading authorities in Great Britain have been hammering away to secure an improvement in the Central Administration, and a greater standard of ability among the officers of the Army.

* To me, it is most amusing to hear honorable members yelling- because any man dares to criticise **British** administration - that he desires to "cut the painter."

* I am loyal to the **British** people - I am descended from them - and I feel that the greatest safeguard to Australia to-day is that the **British** flag floats over her, and that she enjoys the protection of the **British** Navy.

* It is all very well to talk about the **British** flag, and the great protection afforded by the **British** fleet, so long as the world is at peace, but the day may yet come when Great Britain will be involved in an international war, when she will have to call that fleet to the centre of the Empire, and Australia will have to do a little for her own defence.

* Let us stand solidly together, let us strike out on new lines, and build up an Australia that will be a credit to the **British** Empire.

* Throughout the **British** Empire to-day there are clergymen by the score - clergymen of all denominations - who call themselves Socialists.

* He owes no responsibility in an official sense to the people of Australia ; he is the representative of His Majesty the King, and his responsibility is to the **British** Government.

* But, just as the venerable Sovereign who reigned over the **British** people for GO years had to keep her chivalrous impulses' strictly under control, and, no matter how strong her views may have been upon the burning questions of the day, never permitted herself to make a public declaration cither in support of or adverse to the policy of her Ministers, so I think the representatives of the Sovereign in this Commonwealth must always exercise similar control, and recognise the same inviolable rule.

* The Lancefield Gold Mining Company, of which  Mr. E.  H. Taylor is manager, employs seventy foreigners in mining and kindred work, the number  of  **British** employes being unknown.

* It radiates through every part of the **British** dominions, the **British** Islands, Canada and every Colony, State, and Possession.

* of our imported fish is the product of the United Kingdom and **British** Dominions.

* We have emphasized the fact that we prefer **British** imports to foreign imports.

* The importations of **British** polished plate-glass into Victoria in the year 1900 were valued at 1,892, whereas the glass of similar character sent here from Belgium was valued at 11,500.

* Again, so far as cheap glass is concerned, **British** glass is much superior to Belgian, and if we levy a duty upon superficial measurement, we shall give the consumer an opportunity of securing the better article.

* I believe that it is in contravention of the best traditions of the **British** Constitution that a measure of this kind should be in the hands of a private member.

* It is generally recognised in **British** communities that measures of large importance, affecting the people generally, and especially those having to do with the raising and expenditure of public money, should be brought before Parliament by Ministers, with the concurrence of the Executive of the day.

* But procrastination is the fundamental basis of the **British** Constitution ; and it seems to me that procrastination is also the fundamental basis of the Fusion, or fungus, organization which supports the Government.

* Has an appeal for volunteers ever had to be repeated in a **British** community when danger has appeared on the horizon ?

* Happily it is characteristic of the **British** people that twice as many as are wanted always respond to such an appeal.

* I think that, if necessary, I could quote some of the greatest authorities in England in support of the contention that the **British** Army broke down, and did not do as well as England had a right to expect of it.

* Every man of note in the **British** Army  will  admit that, in connexion with the South African war, it failed to do what might reasonably have been expected.

* The **British** fleets all the world over have certain definite duties allotted to them.

* In time of war the **British** Navy would concentrate upon the enemy's vessels wherever found, and sink or blockade them.

* If we are unable to do so, then we are prepared, if possible, to admit **British** manufactures free.

* The honorable member for Echuca, the Prime Minister, and otherprotectionists desire that the **British** people shall impose duties upon the goods sent to them by other nations, and not upon the goods we send.

* They desire that our advantage shall be considered, even at an increased cost to the poor of England, that our farmers may pocket something at the expense of the **British** poor.

* Last night we had an honorable and learned gentleman opposite rebuking a member of this House because he stated that he was prepared to let **British** goods come into Australia., even though they injured Australian industries.

* No vote of mine will ever be given _to place any disability upon men of **British** origin.

* I shall never adopt the policy that because a man is an Australian, and only because he is an Australian, he must be preferred for any position to a man of **British** origin who is not Australian born.

* The **British** people have ever had a friendly feeling for those who have been tyrannized over in their own lands.

* If the **British** people applied the principle of this Bill, they would seek to impose Customs duties upon the goods which we send them, and to prevent their importation.

* One of those firms is **British**.

* If I had my way I would exempt Canada, as a part of the **British** Empire, from the operation of this measure.

* The means adopted might be justified in some great national emergency which made if necessary to go beyond the ordinary **British** methods of getting information, and to adopt more drastic steps.

* I do not attach as much weight as some honorable members have done to the provision regarding the onus of proof, though it introduces a principle repugnant to **British** instincts of fair play, and adopted only in certain classes of legislation, such as the acts relating to insolvency and Customs administration.

* The honorable member for South Australia,  Mr. Glynn,  said that some 300,000,000 of **British** capital is invested in China, and that China would on that account be delicately treated by the Colonial-office.

* But if such an argument holds good in the case of China, it lias much greater force in our favour, because Australasia owes **British** investors some 370,000,000, on which we pay 14,000,000 per annum interest.

* -Their Tariff may do something to enable **British** agriculture - the losses of which to-day are estimated at hundreds of millions sterling - to recuperate.

* If the **British** people think fit to adopt such a Tariff, we shall have no cause to complain.

* All I say is that it ought to be possible for **British** people to obtain the whole of what are known as food products within the **British** Empire without raising the price to the **British** consumer.

* The **British** market - with our producers enjoying an advantage over the foreigner, and competing only against those within the Empire, who share with us the cost of common defence and common national ends - would mean the multiplication of our population, and a settled, occupied, and productive Australia.

* We seek, by judicious effort, to make the Empire trade a home trade for all its communities, so far as it shall be profitable and fair to do so.No one  in Australia desires to be partner in any scheme to nefariously take advantage of the **British** people.

* I wish to see the **British** mercantile navy manned by **British** sailors, and emphasize the word " **British** " in both cases.

* It is not for us to discuss **British** politics, and I do not propose to do so.

* While I shall not discuss **British** politics, I do not propose to introduce the consideration of colonial politics.

* The Canadian people are prepared by arrangement to give a still higher preference to **British** goods.

* The Canadians, however, have from time to time amended their preferential arrangements, and in the last instance increased theirprotective duties against **British** as well as those upon foreign manufactures on two particular lines.

* The Canadians have lately raised their duties on woollens against **British** as well as against foreign manufactures.

* Generally, I should say there is an evident advantage to **British** as compared with foreign trade, and our imports for 1904 are less than they were for 1903.

* On that ground the three self-governing communities which I have mentioned have taken a step which, in my opinion, we should take as early as possible - that is, after the inquiry which I have asked the Prime Minister to make as to the articles in regard to which it is possible to give effective preference to **British** manufacturers.

* It has been by raising the duties on foreign boots that the New Zealand trade has been improved for both **British** and local makers.

* I invite honorable members to approve of the idea of the conference which the present **British** Government proposes to hold, and to suggest that at that conference the Australian representatives should be prepared with information, gathered as the result of a study of our Customs duties, with a view to indicating the extent to which we can enter into reciprocal) relations with the United Kingdom for the benefit of both communities.

* The amendment with which we shall deal presently introduces a proposal entirely novel to the **British** method of dealing with patents, and though I propose to move an amendment of that amendment, we shall still go considerably beyond what the **British** law contemplates.

* Our commerce is protected fully and completely now, as we have all the .strength of
                the **British** navy at our command in the time of emergency, and the amount we pay is a
                very small contribution indeed.

* If it is the object of the honorable member to encourage German as against **British** and Australian artists, I am not with him.

* would be paid, partly by European firms, and partly by **British** firms.

* It has been said time after time that the producers of Australia have suffered be cause designing exporters have put on the **British** or other markets goods which were not up to standard.

* The shipowners could reasonably argue, if the **British** and foreign shipping are not brought under the control of the Court, that they are subject to the unrestricted competition of that shipping, and perhaps, so arguing, might affect the award of the Court.

* It would mean that the **British** ship-owners could not' be brought into Court as witnesses by either party.

* the evidence showed that there was no degree of competition between **British** and foreign shipping and Inter-State shipping, the Judge would be in duty bound to recognise that fact, and would not give the seamen as favourable an award- from their point of view as they would otherwise be entitled to get.

* But the difficulty of our seamen would be increased if they were unable to bring the **British** and foreign ship-owners into Court, in order to show to what extent they did compete.

* I am informed, on good authority, that several measures affecting **British** shipping just as much as these clauses' propose to do, were not reserved for the Royal Assent, but were assented to locally.

* I have not heard honorable members who speak about the rates of freight say that the shipping companies of Great Britain ought to make a vigorous effort to reduce the cost of" their coal, by getting, rid of the royalties paid to **British** landholders.

* We are asked to contribute a certain sum for the defence not only of Australia, but of other parts of the **British** dominions, and to give the 
Admiralty the power to remove the squadron to other waters within the area of the China and East Indies stations.

* If that be , so, what could be fairer than the proposal that the **British** fleet maintained in Australian waters shall be allowed, should occasion require, to leave for Chinese waters.

* Suppose, for the sake of argument, that" the combined fleet of **British** and Japanese warships in the eastern seas was not so powerful as the Russian fleet there, or likely to be there in the near future, and that the **British** fleet maintained in Australian waters consisted of ten or eleven vessels as proposed by this agreement, would it not be madness for us to refuse to allow those vessels to leave this station ?

* Must it not at once appeal to honorable members that we should adopt a suicidal policy if we were to say to the **British** Government - " We will give you the contribution that you ask, but on the condition that you pledge yourselves not to remove the fleet you propose to give vis from Australian waters."

* I can see no advantage to be gained by confining these ships to Australian waters if a Russian or a French fleet were to come in a force of three to one against the **British** fleet.

* If any recollection is right, and I think it is, the language used in another contract with the **British** Government, which we had in mind and have seen, is exactly that which has been employed in this contract of ours.

* The effect of the amendment requested by another place would be to postpone until August next the operation of the provision as to the employment of **British** ships manned exclusively by white seamen.

* But since Saturday last, I have become acquainted with certain facts which will render it necessary for me to propose in this connexion a more serious amendment I have received a cablegram to the effect that the Board of Trade, in examining these proposals, has discovered that the discrimination that we propose in favour of **British** ships is forbidden by a number of treaties, several of which are binding on some, if not all, of the Australian Colonies which assented to them prior to Federation.

* There is also the difficulty that in a number of cases they are drawn in general terms, and apply or may apply in a way determined by the **British** Government.

* I regret to say that it applies to my own proposal that the preference shall be granted only to **British** goods brought out in **British** ships.

* The granting of a preference to **British** goods is clearly within the terms of the agreements, but we are directly forbidden to discriminate between **British** ships and those of quite a number of nations, with whom we have entered into various commercial treaties.

* There is a network of obligations which will have to be considered before it is possible for us to discriminate in favour of **British** shipping.

* In the meantime, the only course open to usis to remove from the schedule the whole of the provision relating to **British** shipping.

* I therefore move - 
That the request be disagreed to, but that the schedule be amended by omitting from the first sub-heading to the column headed "Duties" the words " and imported direct in **British** ships manned exclusively bv white seamen," and by omitting from the second sub-heading to the column headed "Duties" the words "or not imported direct in **British** ships."

* The result of this will be that we shall simply discriminate in favour of **British** goods, without regard to the vessels by which they may arrive.

* There is an evident desire to defeat this measure in some form, or by some device, so as to get rid of the proposed **British** preference, and advantage has been taken of the fact that we have unwittingly included in the Bill a desirable provision forbidden by engagements which we had overlooked.

* There is not the least doubt that if the provision as to **British** ships be allowed to remain in the schedule, even as the Senate wish it to be amended, and without our amendment, the fate of the Bill would be imperilled.

* We proposed yesterday to strike out all the words in the provision after the words "United Kingdom," so that we could grant a preference in respect to **British** goods, no matter what vessels were employed to bring them to our shores.

* By making the Senate's amendment, the condition in regard to **British** ships will remain, with the further condition that only white seamen are to be employed after a certain date next year.

* No step will be wanting, and no resource left untried, to give effect to this measure, which was introduced as an instalment of preference to **British** trade.

* There is not a manufacturer in the whole of Australia who is prepared to take one brick off the Tariff wall in order to allow **British** goods to come in.

* The ambition and aim of every manufacturer is to raise the Tariff wall so high that no **British** goods shall be imported, and yet we have the Government and honorable members here prating about Empire-building by means of the proposed preference.

* I do not for one moment attribute to Australian merchants any general failing in comparison with **British** merchants.

* Australian merchants are worthy of the highest reputation which **British** merchants deservedly enjoy : and those who say that I have spoken ill of my Australian friends and the people to whom I belong, in the way of making comparisons with the merchants of other countries, say that which is not.

* It was then contended that the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court extended outside of the terms of our Constitution, both to **British** ships and to foreign ships, without any express allusion to either; and that, by a general .

* declaration that the jurisdiction of the Court was to embrace those who were employed at sea, we could, by a very simple phrase, bring under the Court **British** ships whose port of call and last port of destination were not within the  Common  wealth, and foreign ships, over which we have no control, generally speaking, except when in port or within our territorial limits.

* The great object attained, from our point of view, by the establishment of such a unit, is that we shall have within it practically every branch of specialized work which is to be found in the **British** Navy itself.

* It will be, so to speak, a segment of the **British** Navy, and it will not be necessary to go outside of it to obtain every class of training which is to be found in the Royal Navy itself.

* The Admiralty are prepared to superintend, their construction through contractors in exactly the same way as they would do if the vessels formed part of the **British** Navy itself.

* In this way, people living iri a **British** community, and as much entitled to vote as I am myself, were deprived of their votes.

* The important distinction between the condition which he has read and that in the proposed contract is that, in the **British** condition, only the Admiralty may purchase ships.

* -The material point is that under the **British** contract, the Imperial Postmaster-General cannot purchase or charter any mail steamers'.

* What should we think if it were proposed by the **British** Government to deport our Australian soldiers from South Africa to India, instead of returning them to their homes here ?

* The writer shows what has-been happening in Western Australia, because of the free and easy **British** way in which foreigners are allowed to look about, and to-do as they like, so long as they do not break the laws of the country - 
I do not desire to occupy very much time in discussing this matter.

* The Coronation of the King will be a very great event in the history of the **British** Empire.

* It is our duty, as part and parcel of the **British** Empire, to see that the Commonwealth is adequately represented upon the occasion of the Coronation.

* on **British** imports - thus granting a preference of id.

* to **British** imports - I shall be happy to support him.

* What then will become of all our demonstrations in favour of **British** influence in the Pacific?

* Are we going to keep  them  under the shadow of **British** and Australian influence, and permit everybody else but ourselves to do business with them ?

* I had a lamp sent to me by the **British** Imperial Oil Company.

* It seems to me that in unthinking minds resistance to the proposal of the Prime Minister may be confused with the desire to resist giving effect to the principle of preference to **British** trade.

* But   1  regard the possible excision of the objectionable feature in the **British** Preference Bill as of more importance than the reputation of the Government, and therefore offer no resistance to this proposal.

* I am simply trying to put the **British** manufacturer on the same footing as the foreign manufacturer.

* During the time it remained under the care of Downing Street, **British** New Guinea was a foster-child.

* Strictly speaking, the proclamation will take place on the 1 st of next month, when, from being a Crown Colony - governed according to the wishes of the .Government of the Commonwealth, but through the GovernorGeneral as representative of the **British** Government - Papua will become the first Territory of the Commonwealth under our Constitution, and under this Parliament.

* Many of the evils of the trying climate will diminish, and perhaps disappear, as the white inhabitants adopt the modern methods which are being popularized throughout all **British** tropical possessions; but at present malaria must be reckoned with.

* Dal ley are the mischievous results of the passing of dictatorial resolutions by this House regarding **British** domestic policy and legislation?

* The present proposal is to make Thursday Island the starting and terminal point for the **British** New Guinea service, with power to change to Cooktown if experience shows that the latter port would be more advantageous.

* Only the King can apply it to the **British** Dominions, if it is applied at all.

* The Commonwealth is not a party to that agreement, and I suppose if we requested the **British** Government not to apply it to us it would npt be applied.

* We have developed under the protection of the **British** Navy.

* Without the protection of the **British** flag to-day, what would be our position as a nation?

* Preference is in all cases given to Australian-made as against imported, and ' to **British** as against foreign-made, material required for the services of the PostmasterGeneral's Department.

* In no other community which possesses constitutional government and lives free under the **British** flag, outside of the States of Australia, do we find female suffrage existing.

* The one occasion on which it was passed by the **British** House of Commons was when it was moved and carried by conservatives.

* Another case to which I direct attention is that of a man named Harry Carrier, a native of Mauritius, and formerly a **British** soldier.

* **British** oak has at all times been regarded as one of the best timbers in the world, and we know that its stability and toughness has been disputed by the Australian ironbark.

* The duty of returning shipwrecked sailors to their own country is an obligation cast upon **British** ship-owners by **British** law.

* any action) bearing the **British** test mark.

* No partisanship is imported into this question in Great Britain, and yet the **British** House of Commons is the cradle of parliamentary life - the institution to which the world turns for an example.

* If this Parliament intends to turn to the American Congress, and away from the **British** House of Commons, -I say: "Well and good, adopt the system which you have adopted," but if this House wants to set an example which may be quoted in other parts of the world, there must be- no partisanship on the question of the Speakership.

* The movements of every armed vessel, whether it be Russian, Japanese, French, German, or of any other country, are known to the **British** Admiralty.

* Seeing that the **British** authorities have this information at their command, there cannot be any doubt that, in the event of a collision between England and any European or Asiatic power, they should have' the control of the war vessels in these waters.

* as to get the benefit of English decisions.. Apart from that, also, people engaged intrade throughout the **British** Empire should be able to know, without having to look at a. multitude of statute-books, what the laws; are.

* They should be able to infer from the laws in operation in England what the laws are likely to be in a **British** dependency.. As a matter of fact, at the Colonial Conference of  1902,  uniformity in respect of patents, copyrights, and other commercial matters was expressly referred to as being; desirable, as will be seen from the report, which can be read in the Library.

* We know that if the surgeons of the day had not failed a woman in her hour of greatest need, Queen Victoria would never have come to the throne of England - a fact established in  Playford  and other classic works ; but I do not for a moment think that the progress of the **British** face would have ceased had that good  lady  not ascended the throne.

* I do not object to a memorial being erected, but I desire that it should take, such a form that it will be a source of blessing to future generations, and will cause people to thank God for the fact that such a good Queen as Victoria occupied the **British** throne.

* I should be prepared to- allow the clause to pass as- it stands, if the experience 10 q 2 of the various **British** possessions where this system of Government has been tried had not shown that it has not been -an unqualified success.

* The honorable and learned member for Indi practically suggests that the whole of our liberties, which we inherit under the **British** Constitution, so far as they are applicable to Australia, will be, imperilled by our allowing the Senate to repeat requests in a modified form.

* I cannot see that the Senate, in making a request the second time in a modified form at our invitation, is imperilling the great wealth of liberty we enjoy under the **British** Constitution.

* over, and the **British** race has paid its obeisance and homage to the rough country farmers who fought so well for their hearths and homes ; but I ask whether one per cent.

* of the Boers who were so successful when matched against trained **British** soldiers could pass examinations of this nature.

* Let me read a little morefrom this syllabus - 
So far as I know, under **British** law there never has been an injunction to stay proceedings.

* It may be a form of expression only ; but as we are dealing with **British** law, and legislating under an Imperial Act, I do not think that we ought to depart from the phraseology which has become known to **British** lawyers.

* I think it would be better if he would adhere to the meaning of the term as it is understood in **British** Courts.

* The expression "injunction" is misused in the States - at least to our understanding, it is used in a host of cases where it is not used in **British** law.

* In view of the urgency of the matter, will the Prime Minister cause each member of the House to be supplied at an early date with a copy of the despatch containing the reply of the **British** Admiralty to the naval proposals of the Government?

* I quite  agree  with the honorable and learned member for Illawarra that the amount of this naval subsidy is a mere drop in the bucket compared with what is spent by the **British** taxpayers on the **British** Navy.

* The **British** taxpayer will protect his own.

* Suppose the **British** fleet were concentrated at one particular place, where it fought thecombined fleets of powers with whom Great Britain was at war.

* Would an agreement of this kind be tolerated by the **British** people themselves ?

* the concentrated fleets might be strengthened by the addition of the Channel fleet and the Reserve squadron, there is no doubt that the Admiralty authorities would nevercountenance the removal of those vessels, from the vicinity of the **British** coasts.

* Nor do I think there is a parallel between this case and the two cases in **British** practice referred to.

* In both of those cases the question of levying either a tax or a rate for the purposes of the **British** Treasury was distinctly included, while in this case there is no proposition to effect any levying of money on any person, to come within the reach of the Federal Treasurer.

* importation of labour during a strike could be fully vindicated, the real aims of the Commonwealth will not be understood or sympathized -with, so long as constantly recurring incidents under the contract sections serve to remind people of the provision which grates upon every **British** susceptibility, by treating the **British** worker under contract as an industrial " pariah " in a **British** community.

* I am unable to subscribe to the wisdom of a stipulation as to the employment of white **British** crews in connexion with such a Bill as this.

* It occurs to me that the provision, which happily has been amended in another Chamber, instead of fostering **British** seamen and assisting the trade of the Empire, would have had the opposite result.

* Had the provision as to **British** shipping been carried info effect, it would have been a blow to the sentiment of Empire.

* We provided that as to 2 per cent, of our trade with Great Britain a preference should be granted conditionally on the re-arrangement of the manning of **British** vessels to carry this small percentage of goods to Australia.

* By the  carrying out of the provision in question, we should have invited the **British**, who, we are told, cannot man their ships with their own labour, to discharge their coloured labour and take on foreign labour in its place.

* No increase in the employment of **British** seamen would Save been secured.

* If we could have insured such an increase, it would have been worth fighting for, but I understand that 50 per cent, of the men on **British** boats to-day are foreigners.

* I could have understood the insertion of this provision if we had made it imperative that Great Britain should employ only **British** seamen on these vessels.

* But since the Bill, as passed by us, would have had the result of giving employment to more foreign labour on **British** vessels, it would not have contributed anything to the cause of Empire.

* No one desires that the number of foreigners on **British** ships shall increase.

* Personally, I should not be averse to paying a prettystiff price to increase the proportion of **British** seamen in our mercantile marine, if only for the better defence of the Empire.

* The right thing to do is to increase the proportion of **British** seamen in our mercantile marine.

* The provision which we are considering would not have done that, but would have resulted in an increase in the number of foreigners employed on **British** ships.

* If the object was to secure a larger proportion of **British** seamen on **British** ships carrying **British** goods the subject of a preference, a different course should have been taken.

* It is best not to pass legislation in this form unless we can be sure of securing our ends - the increasing of the number of **British** seamen in the **British** mercantile marine.

* His Majesty's Government welcomes the new Parliament that to-day takes its place among the great legislative bodies of the **British** Empire.

* InNew South Wales, notwithstanding all the obstacles in the way, the butter industry has been built up to such a degree of perfection that at the Earls Court Exhibition,, in London, the butter produced by the Alstonville factory, on the Richmond River, in the electorate of the VicePresident of the Executive Council, beat all the other butter factories in the **British** Em-  pire.

* This labour traffic, stained with the hearts' blood of the people, has done more than all other causes to depopulate these islands, and it has been aided in its dire work by their trade in firearms, a trade which has lined the pockets of **British** as well as French and other traders with ill-gotten gains.

* But the **British** Parliament did not suggest that any compensation should be given, nor did it make any trouble about the alteration.

* Apparently the Prime Minister has waived also his objection to legislating against the entrance of **British** subjects.

* There are **British** subjects in several of the islands which come within the scope of this measure, but, notwithstanding the fact that they are **British** subjects, this Bill will prevent them from entering the Commonwealth.

* That proposal is preferred by the **British** Government, who are responsible for the whole of the Empire.

* It is a proposal that has been effective where it has been properly enforced, and if that be so, we surely can stretch a point, especially when our experience shows that it would be at least as effective as any of the substitutes suggested, to meet the **British** Government, who have done so much for us.

* No invidious distinction can be made between **British** and foreign shipping engaged in fishing, or in any other branch of trade or commerce beyond territorial waters.

* I have always held, and continue to strongly hold, the opinion that the Bill in which these clauses are embodied, which will have to be reserved .for the Royal Assent, will- be invalidated on account of these clauses, and  that they will be declared to be  ultra vires  of the **British** Merchant Shipping Act.

* But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland.

* But, although it is a poor and dwindling race in Ireland, it has branches everywhere - in all the Colonies and Possessions of the **British** Empire, throughout the great United States, and in all parts of the world.

* There will be no parties but the parties of the **British** Empire.

* A joint address of the two Houses of the English Parliament was presented to the King, in which the members said that they had the - full conviction that by incorporating the legislatures and consolidating the resources of the two kingdoms, we shall increase the power and stability of the **British** Empire, and shall, at the same time, contribute in the most effectual manner to the improvement of the commerce, the security of the religion, and the preservation of the liberties of Your Majesty's subjects in Ireland.

* We are to be relieved from **British** and Irish faction - 
So much for these prophecies.

* One of the chief opponents of theUnion in the **British** House of Commons was  Mr. Charles  Grey, afterwards thesecond Earl Grey, a man whose speech is well worth reading by any of us.

* In it he pointed out, among other' things, that Irish, taxation must, in a united Parliament, depend on **British** interests.

* Now **British** members make Jaws for the Irish people, without any responsibility to them.

* As the great Foster, last Speaker in the House of Commons in Ireland, said- 
I want to point out that the great measures which have been passed ki the **British** Parliament during the last century have been confined to Great Britain, and have not been extended, to Ireland.

* Lord Dunraven, who is one of the most influential men in Ireland, points out - 
Imagine a Department without even the control of the Minister responsible to the **British** House of Parliament.

* A **British** statesman, who happened to be Prime Minister for a time, actually says that a majority of the United Kingdom is not to have its way unless the majority of one part of the Kingdom - the " predominant partner," as he styles England - declare for that way.

* The **British** troops, it is estimated, cost 150 a man per annum to.

* He points out that, even with unjust taxation, the **British** Government gets Jess revenue from Ireland than is annually spent there, by 2,750,000.

* I may point out that, according to Lord Castlereagh, at the time of the Union, the **British** interest bill was 20,000,000 per annum, and that of Ireland -1,300,000 per annum.

* The problem is also represented by the fact that, although New South Wales is a wonderful producer of wealth - one of the largest in the **British** Dominions - the whole of that wealth is in the hands of less than 200,000 people, no less than 550,000 people having no' lot or part in it.

* I hold in my hand an extract from the report for 1904 of the **British** Consul-General at Frankfort.

* He says - 
There is proof in an official document, and if honorable members were to  turn to the report of the **British** Board of Trade presented to the House of Commons, about eighteen, months ago, they would find some very valuable evidence upon the same matter, showing that while it is a fact that certain industries have been injured by dumping, is is also an undoubted fact that certain other industries have been aided by it.

* But if an article is not patented it is within the province of any manufacturer to copy it, whether he be an American, an Australian, or a **British** maker.

* I do not know whether the **British** Government do or not, but it is a power which the Government -ought to have.

* Indeed, Australia should be the recruiting ground for the **British** navy.

* We shall have to be dependent upon the **British** navy for some years to come.

* As the honorable member for Northern Melbourne said - " Our first, our second, and our third line of defence is practically the **British** navy."

* It is true that the **British** Government keeps its fleet out here partly for the defence of her own merchant service.

* Although many of our **British** officers have made mistakes, I think it will be found, when the history of this war is written, that they are not the only officers who have committed errors, but that many blunders have been the result of men with very little military knowledge and experience being placed in charge.

* In the weekly edition of the  Times  recently, a letter from Pretoria was published, in which the writer referred favorably to **British** officers, and said that many of the blunders were made by volunteer officers practically in charge of colonial corps.

* Times  there also appeared a letter from a Cape Colony officer, complaining of the **British** officer, so that it is very difficult for us to get at the truth of the matter.

* Still I am prepared to say that it is our duty, so long as we remain part of the Empire - and I hope  Ave  shall for all time - to do more than we have done ; we shall have to contribute more totowards the keeping up of the **British** navy ; and I hope also that we shall soon have under the law of the country not merely volunteers, but properly-equipped forces foithe defence of the Empire.

* If we read the history of the Victorian reign, we find that there have always been three or four parties in the **British** Legislature; and it is when the three parties are of equal strength there is danger, because perfidy will then creep in, and principles will be often sacrificed.

* The **British** idea of having everything " open and above board" is all right in.

* It is not wise to push these ideas to extremes ; and the allusions which have been made to a-" Star Chamber" have nothing to do with **British** courts of justice as they are conducted to-day.

* I can surmise that the industry was removed to the Continent .to secure the advantage of cheap labour, and the **British** working man is permitted to suffer through the lack of patriotism and foresight cm the part of the **British** people.

* This amendment will impose a most undesirable condition upon the grant of preference to the mother country; but at the same time, it does not conflict with the principle of giving preference to goods of **British** production made by white labour, and carried in **British** ships.

* We all know that it has taken hundreds and hundreds of years to build up the **British** Constitution, and it is idle for any one to imagine that the Labour Party could destroy it in twelve months.

* When  Mr. Beale  was passing through Adelaide on his way toEngland, he gave several gentlemen tounderstand that he could not incur the expense of sending twenty pianos to England for the purpose of showing them at the Franco- **British** exhibition, but for thefact that Lyons and Company had actually ordered them, through their representatives,, who were here last January.

* The leader of the Opposition interjected1 only today to the effect that we cannot bring contract labour here unless it is **British** labour.

* They then proposed - and I do not think that it is a breach of confidence to mention these matters - that the agreement should extend over a period of twenty years, which would be co-extensive with the landing rights on Cocos Island granted to them by the **British** Government for the extension of this very cable.

* They also compare favourably with the terminal rates in other countries outside the European  regimes,  and notably with those of **British** India.

* Mr. Seddon  continues his letter by making a quotation from the report of some proceedings of the **British** Empire 
The remarks of  Sir Sandford  Fleming, of which he forwarded me a copy, have been perused with the attention and respect they deserve,as the views of an old and ardent advocate of the Pacific cable ; but I am quite unable to see how the proposed action of the Commonwealth, which must tend to the ultimate benefit of the Pacific cable, can occasion a difficulty of such far-reaching influence as he fears.

* The prospects of the **British** people, and the future of the Empire as a whole, will not, in my opinion, be affected, unless favorably, by proceedings which, in the only honorable way open to it, the Commonwealth is taking to remove what is said to be an impediment to the progress of the Pacific cable.

* I am not aware of any legal text-book which declares that Australian-born children of aliens are not **British** subjects unless their parents are naturalized.

* There is no doubt at all that **British** nationality results from birth inany part of the **British** Dominions, whatever the nationality of the parents.

* But when Ministers do nothing but throw a message down on the table of the House, and, disclaiming all responsibility, say, " Here you are ; any private member can bring forward a financial proposal ;we will give the necessary authority, though we are not at one regarding it " - it is adopting a course utterly at variance and inconsistent with parliamentary procedure, not only in this Parliament, but in the mother of Parliaments, and, indeed, every Parliament throughout the **British** Dominions.

* Of the total amount, what proportion is carried by oversea ships, distinguishing, if possible, between **British** and foreign ships, and also between passenger and ordinary freight trade  1 
I should like to know whether under this Bill it is intended to extend these powers and privileges to any life assurance company, irrespective of whether it is incorporated under any Act of the Commonwealth, or under any Statute of the Empire or of foreign countries.

* The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs, who introduced this measure, is not present, but I think that it was intended to confine these powers to **British** and Australian life assurance companies.

* If it does not a foreign company might commence business without any of the guarantees associated with **British** societies in **British** countries.

* For instance, in some foreign country - say in one of the States of South America - a companymight be incorporated without any proper security, and might commence business in Australia on a basis utterly devoid of the safeguards that we attach to **British** and Commonwealth companies.

* I would remind the right honorable gentleman, however, that a motion relating to insurance companies doing business in the Commonwealth, that are neither Australian nor **British**, has appeared for some time on the noticepaper in the name of the honorable member for Herbert.

* Under it only a **British** or Australian insurance company would be subject to those safeguards with which we are familiar.

* Honorable members are aware that the Commonwealth hastaken over the administration of **British** New Guinea.

* The preferences given last year applied to only 1,473,189 worth of **British** imports, the total imports from the United Kingdom, in 1905, being 23,074,717; and of those affected, only 790,607 compete with foreign imports.

* Honorable members will bear in mind that the question was raised in a speech made by  Mr. Chamberlain  in, I think, May, 1903, in which he laid it down that preference must become the basic principle of Empire; that the Empire would fall to pieces unless it became- commercially self-contained ; that, in fact, unless we went, through reciprocal preferences, to an intermediate stage of free-trade between **British** possessions, and ultimate political union, the days of the Empire would be numbered.

* He says that - 
England abolished preferences in i860, while France and other countries have continued to grant them to their colonies; but the condemnation of the system is to be found in the fact that the external trade of **British** possessions is about ten times that of those of France.

* The Canadians strongly remonstrated, and almost talked of secession, so that  Mr. Gladstone  was obliged to mention in a despatch, dated 3rd June, 1846 - 
In Canada they want not to abolish the **British** preference or even reduce the percentage of preference, but to raise the general Tariff so high that when the preference is allowed the minimum Tariff will be high enough to set off the greater cost of labour and higher rates of interest, thus placing the Canadian manufacturer on an equality with the **British** competitor.

* The best of the **British** writers at the present time condemn the principle of preference.

* Let me give an extract from an article dealing with the result of the Imperial Conference which was published in the  Edinburgh Review  of July, 1907- 
To our thinking the safest condition of that magnificent and unique political entity called the **British** Empire,, is that it should remain as Amorphous as possible, and that it is best described and will be most safely maintained as a number of practically independent States, acknowledging one sovereign, bound together bv  unembarrassing  ties of blood and origin, and of consequent affection, filial and parental.

* The imports of Great Britain in 1906 were of the value of 607,000,000, and 76.6 per cent, of those imports came from foreign countries, only 23.4 per cent, coming from **British** Possessions.

* I have not the exact &gt; words used by the Treasurer, but the effect of his speech was that the exports of **British** products - and I think he was dealing, with manufactured products - to **British**.

* The position is  that, deducting  exports to us representing loans, from 1881 to 1905, the value of **British** exports to Australia increased from- 69,500,000 to 141,000,000.

* If it be cabled to England tomorrow that we have made a concession of even 50 per cent, in favour of **British** imports, the Conservatives will be  immediately  supplied with a handle that may be used by them in their efforts to induce the country to reverse the decision which was given at the last general election there.

* As has been very pertinently remarked by the honorable and learned member for Corio, the amendment would be more  apropos  if the Bill provided for a preference to all **British** imports.

* I recognise that it is desirable that an attempt should be made to regulate the class of men employed on **British** ships engaged in the trade of the Empire, but the whole question is so linked to the welfare of every section of the Empire, that if cannot be' dealt with in an off-hand way.

* As a matter of fact, these preferential proposals relate to only .650,000 worth of **British** imports.

* Many foreign goods are carried in **British** ships along with goods from the United Kingdom, and therefore it seems to me that the provision which the honorable member proposes to insert in the Bill could not be carried out.

* But I remind honorable members that at the Imperial Conference the Prime Minister did very good work for Australia in securing the passage of a resolution to the effect that every effort should be made to divert immigration from the United Kingdom to other parts of the **British** Empire.

* I do not want the impression to go abroad that there is any considerable party in Australia that objects to **British** immigration to our shores, nor do I wish to leave it to be understood that honorable members opposite are the only representatives of the people in this House who are in favour of that policy.

* Of wheat and flour alone something like 183,000,000 bushels are imported into the United Kingdom, of which 145,000,000 are from foreign countries, the **British** possessions supplying the remainder.

* The importation of butter into the United Kingdom represents from 16,000,000 to 17,000.000, of which the foreigner supplies13, 500,000, and Australia and other **British** possessions the balance.

* I do not see'.why we should not continue an arrangement by which- a few **British** silver coins could still be accepted in Australia as the equivalent of similiar Australian coins.

* I want to have it permanently established that any one calling at an Australian port with a few **British** silver coins in his pocket shall have no difficulty in making any purchases that he may require on shore with them.

* A great number are well-established **British** companies, and in these matters the word "**British**" is almost synonymous with. "

* We are spending 12,000 a year, and the greater part of that sum is spent, not for any pecuniary gain, but for the purpose of maintaining such occupation as exists by **British** subjects in this group.

* As a consequence of the latest agreement,, freight from the group to Australia has been reduced to a fourth of the previous charge - a very considerable and direct boon to the **British** settlers, which may be set off to some extent against the greater boons offered to the French settlers.

* On reflection the honorable member for Robertson will see many reasons why it is difficult to give further assistance to **British** settlers, in a territory which is not ours, and which mav never be ours, in the sense in which Fiji or Australia is a territory,' unless we are fortunate enough to induce the mother country to take a different view from that which has guided her statesmen in the past.

* One plea that we can urge upon the **British** Government is that if the same zeal were shown on our behalf as has been exhibited by the French Republic on behalf 
This Bill, like most important measures of the present session, deals with what is essentially a nonparty question.

* The wide expanse of sea which separates us from those military nations is, in my opinion, our greatest safeguard, because in order to invade Australia any of these military powers of the old world must run the gantlet of the **British** fleet, and must operate so far from their base of  operations as to place them at an enormous disadvantage.

* When those islands are under the control of the Commonwealth, or at any rate under the **British** flag, it will be impossible for any European nation to form  depots,  arsenals, or coaling stations within easy distance of our coast.

* That gentleman visited the Scotch College, and, after telling the boys that they should try to out-**British** the **British** in their patriotism, he said - 
.- Unlike the honorable member for Parramatta, I know the representatives of the **British** Imperial Oil Company, and have met the representative of the Standard Oil Trust.

* This morning I ascertained that the **British** Imperial Oil Company Limited consist of 2,000 shares, of which the Asiatic Petroleum Company Limited hold 1,993 shares.

* The statement that it is an entirely **British** company is not correct.

* The **British** Constitution is not a written Constitution, though there are certain portions which have been embodied in statutory enactments and charters.

* A **British** dependency is not dominated or ruled by a foreign Government in this particular matter.

* In other words, an appeal lay to the Privy Council in all other cases, and also in cases involving the interests of any part of the **British** Dominions outside of Australia.

* The clause was finally redrafted by the Drafting Committee to read - 
That was the view put forward by the Australian delegates to 'the **British** Government concerning Australian intentions in regard to the High Court.

* Queen's Dominions, or the **British** Empire as a whole, will be subject to an appeal to an Imperial Court.

* I am merely pointing out that at this stage of the proceedings Australians desired an Australian  Court to interpret the Constitution, and' that the **British** Government .agreed with that desire.

* We have been told that our only danger is from raiding cruisers, which may evade the **British** ships and do damage to our coastal cities.

* If the **British** fleet were away, the whole of our Inter-State trade would be at the mercy of such vessels.

* It may be narrowminded, but, as I am of **British** descent, I wish our population to be mainly a **British** population.

* Regarding cabled extracts from German newspapers as to the counter claims made by Germany as a set-off against Australia's Marshall Islands claim, has any official communication yet been received from the **British** Government ?

* Is it a fact that Germany received large sums from Great Britain for claims made during the Boer War, which claims were paid promptly, and, it was understood, satisfactorily, by the **British** Government?

* It was, as stated in  Mr. Jenkins'  telegram to  ,Sir John  Forrest of 23rd instant, to support **British** Government's policy in South Africa, and to farewell contingent.

* Any one familiar with conditions in American mines, mills, factories and workshops, and with the statistics of production in this country, must admit that the **British** workman is' quite right.

* As a consequence, they work themselves to death, or to a condition of premature old age earlier than their **British** fellow workmen.

* A great deal could be done by placing the real position of Australia before the **British** public, and imbuing them with the confidence that inspires us as public men.

* Even through an exalted dignitary like the High Commissioner, these facts could be with advantage placed before the **British** public, and would have much more force than if communicated by the somewhat mercenary mouths of theatrical paid agents.

* I would, therefore, still propose to give pensions to those who are natural born subjects of Great Britain, and word my amendment in such a way as to omit " except those born in Australia" and insert "except naturalborn **British** subjects " inlieu thereof.

* But I am not willing to deprive the minority of that proper right of criticism and' resistance which, in the Legislatures of **British** communities, has been productive of some of the best results to the people.

* We seem to forget that it is not always a good measure which a Government may endeavour to force through, and that the power of resistance given; to Par- liament till the voice of the people may be heard upon it, has, upon certain occasions, proved one of the most valuable safe- ' guards of **British** communities.

* Then there was some talk about applying the closure adopted in the **British** Parliament.

* That the following proviso be added to clause 14: - '* Provided that no contract or arrangement shall be entered into with any person or corporation that directly or indirectly employs other than white **British** subjects in the carrying out of such contract or arrangement."

* Any agreement made with the **British** Government should be for a short period only, as the minting should: be done in Australia as soon as possible.

* In Canada Ave have the instance of **British** Columbia, which refused to enter the Union on the original terms.

* It was not until years afterwards that **British** Columbia undertook to enter the Union, and that was only on condition that the Dominion Parliament should construct a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and run trains daily from either end.

* The few cases in which men would be brought in under contract are not sufficient to justify what appears to be a blow at our **British** fellow-subjects.

* The proposal in the Bill would serve no good purpose, and the amendment shows, at any rate., a desire on our part to discriminate in favour of **British** subjects.

* I am an Australian first and a member of the **British** Empire afterwards.

* It would be easy for French and German manufacturers to export their goods to Great Britain, un labelled, and then to send them out here labelled "**British**."

* An expression of opinion by the citizens of Adelaide, or those who lead them, in reference to the slanders on the **British** troops, and those matters which have been so ably alluded to in the House by the Prime Minister with the hearty approval of honorable members, requires no military pageant.

* The expression of opinion follows on the sentiments which were expressed so ably in the resolutions submitted to this House and afterwards transmitted by cable to England, conveying our disapproval of the slanders of the continental press, and our absolute approval of what had been done by all branches of the **British**  army.

* They are resolutions of such a character that no branch of the **British** army in England would be paraded to assist in passing them at a public meeting.

* The honorable member for Canobolas has pointed out that a great principle of **British** law is at stake.

* It is possible under the Punishment of Offences Act, for one justice of the peace to sentence an offender to any term of* imprisonment not exceeding sixmonths, because, although that.Act provides that its jurisdiction shall not be exercised except by a stipendiary, police, or special magistrate, it also allows its exercise by - 
, - I have seen the article referred to, which appears to relate to an outrage committed by persons, not **British**, on an island the territory of a foreign power.

* Under the regulations which govern recruiting for the Queensland plantations, only **British** subjects.may be employed on the vessels, and an agent of the Government is on board each vessel.

* So far as acts aredone by foreign vessels, operating on territory which is not **British**, I fail to see how the Commonwealth can interfere.

* It was on Matthias Island, which is not **British**.

* That  gun  stocks in the rough, and barrels not fitted to any action, bearing the **British** test mark, be admitted free,  and that other barrels or actions should be dutiable at 5s.

* There was very little **British** sentiment in the speech of the honorable member for Gwydir, who discussed protection' rather than preferential trade.

* derived from the new duties might be handed over to a trust for distribution amongst **British** workmen.

* Our markets will not be rendered more easy of access to **British** manufacturers, and no appreciable stimulus will be given to **British** trade.

* I believe that the Bill will help to remove misrepresentation, and to place before the people of England a true expression of our intention, which is not to prevent the immigration of **British** subjects, but to prevent the introduction of labour under contract.

* I should like to know what sort of respect or love or patriotism there was for the **British** Empire in that statement?

* The Prime Minister appears to me not to want preferential trade for the **British** Empire, except as an excuse for getting higher duties against the United States and  against Europe.

* He went on to say that one of the results would be to create a greater outlet for **British** manufactures.

* I think that it could be shown that in the two great **British** communities - the United Kingdom and America - notwithstanding what has been stated by the honorable member for Melbourne, the principle of voluntary conciliation and arbitration has been attended .with unmistakable success.

* Let us look at the magnitude of these associations in order that we may consider whether  ther  the old **British** instinct of self-reliance has failed in this matter of conciliation and arbitration.

* It is this capacity for organization and autonomy, which is so marked in the relations of social and industrial life, that has made the **British** in modern times the great governing race of the world, and has enabled the traditions of the free institutions of the mother country to be perpetuated wherever **British** .. enterprise has founded a new community.

* On the question of the growth of voluntary arbitration and conciliation, I wish merely to quote the report of the **British** Iron Trade Commission on American industrial conditions.

* Section 5 seems to have been substituted for them, because it contains all that the other provisions contain and is still wider in its application, conferring, as it does jurisdiction over every **British** ship, even when it has passed beyond- the three miles limit, whose first port of clearance and first port of destination are within the Commonwealth.

* If honorable members argue to the contrary, their&gt; contention simply means that our Constitution is lopsided, because under the Trade and Commerce sections we should then have power to deal with Inter-State traffic upon land, and with traffic upon **British** ships, but our power to control the foreigner would be prescribed by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894.

* For that reason I think that the Attorney-General is mistaken in his view that the power to regulate the coastal trade, as regards **British** ships, is not equally co-extensive with, and subject tothe same conditions as apply to foreign, vessels.

* If, then, with a knowledge of the far - reaching character of this measure, of its effect upon local autonomy, its addition of a new set of tribunals to the already complex and elaborate judicial machinery of the States, its reliance against the healthier modern tendency of **British** working class traditions on State instrumentality for the re-adjustment of the relations of capital and labour, they still give their fiat to this Bill, we must only with a relieved sense of responsibility accommodate our judgments to the verdictof public opinion.

* on national physique, wherein it is stated - "The **British** educational authorities intend to give more systematic attention in future to the physical development and general health of the children attending the elementary schools.

* Simultaneously with the announcement of this new policy there has been a discussion on the subject at the annual meeting of the **British** Medical Association.

* I do not know whether it is a **British** tradition, but certainly it is a **British** habit, that in London a great deal of business is done over the dinner or luncheon table.

* Others believe that it is advisable that there should be an Imperial fleet for our defence, that we should depend only on the **British** Navy, and that our local defences are useless for the purpose.

* I do not think that it is necessary to read the paper which I have before me with reference to the pre ference proposals of the Government, but the following table shows the value of the imports in 1906 of the articles enumerated below from Great Britain and from foreign countries, including **British** Dominions :  - 
I am not sure.

* **British** preference proposals of the Government affect 153 items, all of which are important, out of a total of 436 items.

* This is aday when the absence of combinations in the **British** marine has caused the **British** Hag to be transferred from ships which we were proud indeed to own.

* There have been books upon books exclusively devoted to company law, but no one ever thought of there being anything in those books about the law of monopoly, because there is no distinction between companies and individuals with regard to monopolies in **British** or American law.

* Would that mean that this Parliament might prescribe one factory law for aliens and another factory law for **British** subjects?

* Mr. GLYNN (South Australia)'.- I wish to call the attention of the Minister to a matter relating to ships which are not on any Colonial or **British** register, but which, apart altogether from completing a voyage from a foreign port, trade between Australian ports.

* There is a provision in the Imperial Customs Act that such ships are to be subjected to the same regulations in every respect as are those on the **British** register.

* The preference for " Nugget" isas between it and other **British** polishes.

* There is evidently something in it that makes people demand it, so that it is not a question as between an Australian and a **British** article, but as between **British** and **British**.

* I do not know why a departure has been made from that old practice, unless the Government have decided to adopt an American, rather than a **British**, system, which is known as " the spoils to the victors," and, because they happen to have a majority on that side of the House, to coerce that majority, the selection made not meeting with its unanimous approval, into indorsing it by a caucus decision.

* I regret that we are substituting a doubtful American practice for the good old **British** practice that has heretofore obtained.

* Let us suppose that when the Imperial authorities have arranged for the concentration of these three fleets at a certain point, wrangling takes place in the Cabinet, the golden moment may pass, and disaster to the **British** Navy may lie at the feet of Australian statesmen.

* Should the time ever arrive when we have a squadron of our own, with the **British** fleet as an auxiliary force, we can then do what we choose ; but the whole principle of this Bill is an amalgamation of interests, and the idea underlying it is that the control shall belong to the **British** Navy.

* Are we going to establish a Commonwealth stock as proposed, and stick to the one rate of 3 per cent., accepting the market rate as it arises, as the **British** Government does with its consols ?

* I have very carefully perused the Treasurer's financial statement, as reported in  Hansard,  and I think that if it is read, as I hope it will be, throughout the **British** Possessions, it will create a distinctly favorable impression.

* It is idle to expect that we can lay down the lines of a complete scheme_ without taking into our counsels the masters of the situation, namely, our **British** and foreign bondholders.

* The white population of **British** New Guinea consists mostly of miners and traders who are realty pioneers developing what no doubt will become an important part of the Commonwealth.

* Until the population of **British** New Guinea exceeds 2,000 it would be impossible under this proposal for them to exercise any greater voice in the management of the affairs of the Territory than they would, at the present time.

* Each was a dependency of the **British** Crown.

* And the Government in each case was the Government of the **British** Sovereign.

* Probably, without an acquaintance with the principles of statutory interpretation, according to **British** methods, one would think there was some force in that contention.

* -All Parliaments under the **British** Constitution have very carefully safeguarded their rights in connexion with the military Estimates.

* Since 1688 the **British** Parliament has so jealously conserved' its powers in this regard that the Estimates have provided for yearly payments only, and I think that the care exercised by the Imperial legislature affords us an example which we should do extremely well to follow.

* The person sent should have lived under conditions similar to those existing in New Guinea, in some other **British** Crown.

* I am sure  that the desire of this Parliament is that the natives should be treated as they have been in the past, under **British** control.

* Personal government has been shown by experience in **British** possessions of this character to be the best and most successful.

* That the words," Provided that a tender of payment of money, if made in **British** coins, other than gold coins, shall not be a legal tender for any amount after a date to be fixed by proclamation," be left out.

* iso because it is open to misconstruction, as it is not intended that a proclamation shall be issued during the continuance of the agreement with the **British** Government, which covers a period of fifteen or twenty years.

* We have arranged that the mints shall cease to import **British** coin, and that we shall supply Australian coin for local use, as required.

* **British** silver coin will continue to circulate here; but 100,000 worth will be withdrawn annually, until it all disappears.

* If there is any drift of **British** coin to Australia, it would be exchangeable at its face value, under our arrangement with the Imperial Government.

* What I think the Attorney-General wishes to do is to say that any person who is not a **British** subject either naturalized under the laws of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth, or of the State, and who is convicted of any crime of violence against the person may be, asked by the officer to comply with the conditions of paragraph (a)of clause 4.

* Then we need to describe him as a person who is not a **British** subject.

* Concerning the remarks of the Prime Minister, I would point out that it is well known to patentees all over the world that patents issued by the **British** Government are absolutely valueless.

* A **British** patent is worthless until it has emerged from the fire of actual litigation.

* We have been repeatedly and maliciously slandered by persons who have stated that no **British** subject can come to Australia.

* It should be  clearly  understood that no obstacle is imposed to the free immigration of **British** subjects into Australia, so long as they have not entered" into contracts to work at wages lower than those which are current within the Commonwealth.

* For instance, the Marine Insurance Bill introduced by the Government, is practically a transcript of the **British** Act; and there should have been no difficulty in submitting that legislation some time ago.

* The measure is none the worse for being a transcript, seeing that England is the centre of the Imperial insurance world, and the **British** Act may be accepted as the last word on the subject.

* names of some of the best Sheffield makers are attached to worthless goods, and in this way not only are our consumers being imposed upon, but grave injury is being done to **British** manufacturers, with whom it should be our desire to do business.

* To a large extent it has been modelled upon the American Supreme Court, and I do not consider the departure from **British** precedent altogether wise, because in my opinion Parliament should be the custodian of the Constitution.

* In that case the 
I find that 11,959 worth of them were **British** and foreign produce, and that only 1,666 represented Australian produce.

* I say calmly, dispassionately, and without any ill-feeling to anybody, that this business is going to be a failure; that the promoters are going to water their stock; that they are going to over-capitalize to such an extent that they never can pay dividends ; and that the widows and orphans whose money is drawn out of **British** consols for investment in this business on the strength of the fact that the Commonwealth Government is at.

* Today, we are sorry to state, the Armenian is outstripped by the Melbourne **British** Customs thief.

* It is humiliating to think that Australia is peopled by the **British** race.

* In putting forward the proposals in the Bill, the Postmaster-General not only desires to legislate in a federal spirit for a federated community, but he evidently had in his mind the statement made by  Mr. Sandford  Fleming, that a feature of peculiar importance in the **British** telegraph service is the adoption of a uniform charge for all distances.

* From a common-sense point of view the Bill means nothing more than a declaration that we do not wish coloured immigrants to come here, and as such a declaration it is neither clear nor logical.We do not want it because it does not confer power.We have the power to stop any alien colou red immigrants to-morrow morni n g. Not by an Act of State ; an Act of State is not necessary, because any one can stop an immigrantwho is not of **British** nationality, inasmuch as the **British** courts do not give him any right of action for trespass.

* The honorable member went so far as to state that the **British** manufacturers were unable to make some of the materials which were produced on the Continent.

* As I understand, "  His  Majesty's Government" does not altogether mean  His  Majesty's **British** Government, as the motion might lead us to believe.

* What is meant is that the committee authorizes " the Government " - that is, the Australian Government - 
To accept **British** New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth if His Majesty's Government - 
That is,  His Majesty's **British** Government - 
I take it that the Government in Australia is as much His Majesty's Government as the Government in England.

* Therefore, what is really intended by the term " His Majesty's Government" in the motion is "His Majesty's **British** Government."

* Instead of saying that the resolution says - 
Many investors appear to regard their investments in **British** countries in the nature of contracts, to which theGovernments of those countries are parties.

* "Invest your money under the **British** flag, which assures protection and justice to every one beneath it."

* I believe in preserving the **British** Empire.

* There are only two free nations in the world, the American and the **British**, and we should do all we can to increase the power and influence of the Empire.

* I venture to say that the Treasurer never heard of a **British** Government referring to a Select Committee for inquiry a question bearing upon the relations of the Imperial Government to, say, the Indian Government.

* He never heard of the **British** Government surrendering its rights in such a matter.

* It was my privilege when in London, now nearly two years ago, to arrive at the basis of an agreement, with the **British** Admiralty by means of which they were to advise and give" any assistance they could put at our disposal.

* And we were to be empowered to establish a coastal defence of our own in small vessels, with a flotilla of our own, manned by men who should be maintained at the high standard of efficiency of the **British** Navy.

* Of course, those born in India, which is in the **British** Dominions, are **British** subjects, but Asiatics not born in India are not capable of naturalization in this country.

* -I do not object to the proposed contribution to the **British** Institute, or to the Townsville Hospital, but I would point out that, in making this grant to assist the study of tropical diseases, we do not absolve ourselves from further responsibility in the matter.

* The New Hebrides are not part of Australia, the islands being under a joint **British** and French Protectorate.

* We do not "even give the 5 per cent, preference which is given in respect to certain **British** importations.

* I have become aware that Captain Strachan, who has complained to the secretary to my Department, has a grievance against the authorities of the **British** North Borneo Company, and I have initiated correspondence with the Colonial-office on the subject.

* I may say that I lost no time in inquiring into the representations made, and I understand that since I did so the authorities of the **British** North Borneo Company have given to the Government of New South "Wales an account of the occurrence which is very much at variance with that of Captain Strachan.

* I do not suppose there have been many instances in **British**, countries in which the members Of a party have exhibited so much -bravery as have those of the present Government.

* higher in American and **British** type foundries than in the Australian ones - question  94136-7.

* I have pointed out that' the American and **British** workmen have greater reason to complain in this instance of the lower wages paid in the Australian industry, and that therefore there is not a tittle of excuse for removing this item from the free list.

* The missionaries in **British** New Guinea say that everything is going along all right, and I should like to know how the honorable member expects to improve matters by placing the traffic under Government control.

* per bottle in **British** New Guinea.

* It is contended, for example, that if we do not allow intoxicating liquor to be imported into **British** New Guinea, it will be smuggled into the Possession.

* Here is a chance for us to declare in our statutes, once and for all, that Ave will take every precaution to keep liquor from the natives of **British** New Guinea, having in view the disastrous results which it has worked elsewhere.

* Let us examine the results of the application of the closure in the **British** Parliament.

* It included a portion of Zulu territory, which, as between the **British** Parliament and the Boers, should have been left untouched.

* I find that, in the balancesheet of the South **British** Company, the losses set down as having been sustained in 1904 amounted to 159,000.

* I have no desire to discount the strategical value of these islands to the Empire, but Australia has already contributed very largely to the naval subsidy, and should not be called upon further to provide naval stations in the Pacific for the **British** Fleet., However important these islands may be as outposts to the Commonwealth, they must be still more important to the Imperial policy of Having naval and coaling stations scattered broadcast along the trade routes.

* In addition to this subsidy, which we are asked to pay, in order to extend increased facilities to the 214 **British** subjects who have settled in the New Hebrides- 
I think that the Committee will be wise if it adopts the amendment proposed bv the Prime Min ister.

* As the  Chairman  has ruled it in order, we have to remember that the schedule does not provide that the ships carrying preference goods shall be manned by **British** seamen, but by white seamen.

* Therefore, instead of operating to the advantage of **British** sailors, the provision would tend to confer benefit upon foreign seamen.

* It is well known that **British** vessels are manned very largely by foreign seamen, principally Germans, because it is found that not more than 52 per cent, of seamen required for the **British** mercantile marine are available for such service.

* If the schedule were adopted in its present form, it would practically provide for a subsidy to German seamen, and the **British** mercantile marine would be used for the purpose of training men who would be withdrawn in time of war to man vessels belonging to the German Navy.

* all such stores are, while the vessel is in **British** waters, locked up and sealed on board, or, if further foreign voyage is not soon contemplated are removed to a Queen's warehouse and kept in charge until required by the owners.

* There is, however, us indicated above, a generous allowance in respect of stores made as to vessels resting solely in **British** waters.

* There is, however, as indicated above, a generous allowance in respect of stores made as to vessels resting solely in **British** waters.

* So whether we can do it or not, the plan now proposed is different from the plan which prevails in **British** commerce.

* this very difficulty, on which the writer says - 
A different question arises as to vessels which may commence their journey abroad by some coasting traffic in **British** waters, or having arrived from abroad at one port may be destined to go to one or to several others.

* So that even a **British** ship, if she trades between Fremantle and Sydney, touching at ports, and back again from Sydney to Fremantle, will be under the same obligations as our own Australian-owned ships.

* That is to say, a French ship trading between English ports, if she chooses to do so, will be subject to the same law as ' the coaster owned by the **British** merchant ; but they go further in England - 
It  has, however, been long held, first as to foreign vessels, and ultimately as to **British** ves  sels, that these beginnings and ends of foreign voyages, provided the3' genuinely are such, shall, for the purposes of stores, be considered part  of  the foreign voj'age, and stores be allowed accordingly.

* It  has been veiy long held, first as to foreign vessels, and ultimately as to **British** vessels - and we may be sure that the Customs house was not keen to hold these points - that these beginnings and endings of foreign voyages, provided they genuinely are such, shall,  for the purposes of stores, be considered part of the foreign voyage, and the stores be allowed accordingly.

* From, the free-trade point of view we might easily have raised the question by selecting a certain number of articles of **British** manufacture, upon which we could ask the Committee to make a substantial reduction of duty in the case of **British** goods, while protectionists, if not agreeable to that course,' might have proposed to increase  the duties against the foreigner in conformity with their present policy.

* As the Committee has decided that the duty under the general Tariff shall be 2d., I should have been prepared to agree to the **British** preferential duty on candles being fixed at id.

* per lb., as it stood under the old Tariff, but for the fact that the **British** manufacturers themselves have already pointed out that that duty was.

* **British** imports of candles were shut out.

* I hope that we may take it that the Attorney-General will be in attendance here when the Bill as further discussed, and that some effort will be made by the Government to open our doors to reputable **British** immigrants.

* The masters of the Government want the union label, but they do not care to encourage the immigration of reputable **British** citizens, unless they have money in their pockets.

* I agree with the honorable member, just as I think that the **British** Government will, later on, find it necessary to insert in their own postal contracts a provision for the employment of a minimum proportion of **British** subjects on their mail steamers.

* Provided that persons who have acted as instructors in the **British** Army or those who, having served in the **British** Army, satisfy the Director that they have the necessary qualifications may be appointed without passing through such course."

* I am not a sentimentalist who thinks that the competition of **British** shipping is any better for those interested than is competition from any other part of the world.

* Would he say that a **British** company owning a mine in Western Australia, the working of which did not produce dividends, would be justified in paying lower wages than the proprietors of other mines in the locality ; or would he say that a woollen factory which, perhaps, in consequence of obsolete machinery and bad management, was not paying dividends, should give its men lower wages than a woollen factory which was paying dividends?

* The introduction of a Federal Navigation Bill containing provisions for the protection of Australian shipping from the competition of foreign and **British** steamers in the coastal trade of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the abolition of the employment of kanakas upon Australian steamers trading from Australian ports to the South Sea Islands is advisable.

* There is ample evidence in **British** newspapers of the wrong done  by  the States in advertising.

* That having been decided, ve should ask the **British** authorities to send us out the best officer they have, and intrust to him the entire control of our military expenditure.

* Personally, I believe that our coastal and harbor defences are being neglected for our land forces, and that we could give greater assistance to the Imperial authorities by building up naval reserves than by increasing our contribution to the **British** Navy.

* Does he contend that that is a move in the right direction  1  If it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of protecting Australian and Imperial interests that the control of the **British** and Australian fleets shall be placed entirely in the hands of the Admiralty authorities, the case should be proved up to the hilt.

* I venture to say that **British** people who are not prepared to contribute funds to defend their own honour are unworthy of any defence.

* In every other **British** Dominion where there is a distinct coinage, the standard is lower, namely,  80  per cent, of silver and  20  per cent, of alloy.

* I have yet to be convinced that a genuine **British** workman, whether of first, second, or third grade, will live in insanitary conditions, like the lowest class of Chinese, unless he chooses to do so.

* per week, and it is absurd to ask us to believe that where a body of **British** workmen are grouped together in an industry of any kind with continuous .

* Is it to be believed that fifty **British** workmen living together cannot obviate insanitary conditions by taking a little extra trouble as to how they conduct some small part of their daily life.

* Mr. THOMSON (North Sydney).- I do not know of my own knowledge whether cottonseed oil or even olive oil is injurious ; but I know that edible fat mixed with cottonseed oil has been sold in England for years, and the **British** Adulteration Acts are the strictest in the world.

* If the **British** Government allow this article to be imported, we may be pretty sure that it is perfectly wholesome.

* There is no doubt that the term "**British** possession," when originally used in the days before autonomous government for the colonies was granted, was thought to be and was sufficiently correct for the purposes indicated in this Bill.

* I do not think that we could in any way consider Canada or Australia a **British** possession in the sense of being possessed by the **British** people.

* These countries are possessed by their own people, though those people are certainly a portion of the **British** race.

* I think that the people of Australia will insist very strongly upon the fact that the inhabitants of India are not upon the same plane of citizenship'-in regard to the Empire as we are; and the Attorney-General ought to give careful consideration to the point whether the term " **British** possession " should not be made to apply only to such countries as" are now held in a greater or less degree by the power of the sword, and are inhabited by people who do not belong to the **British** race.

* That Act relates only 'to **British** ships and boats attached to **British** ships.

* under the **British** preference proposals.

* I wish to know whether the Government have determined that the preference granted to **British** over foreign goods in connexion with tenders shall be that which this Parliament has fixed, or whether every Minister is to grant a secret preference, according to his mood or mind, to **British** as opposed to foreign goods?

* .- Reference having been made to  the  duties on confectionery in force in the United Kingdom, I wish to refute, by a quotation from the **British** Tariff, certain misleading statements which have been put forward.

* The Tariff is published in  The Shipping World Year-Book,  which is corrected to the 15th December, 1906, on pages 837 and 838 of which appear the following; statements regarding the **British** confectionery duties - 
.

* -I hold in my hand letters from four of, I believe, the leading firms in England, complimenting the Government and the Parliament upon the preference which has been offered in this Tariff to **British** imports.

* Limited, of Prescot, Henry Williamson, "of London, and Rotherham and Sons, of Coventry, have written long letters in which they approve of the action of the Parliament, and thank the Government for proposing this preference to **British** watches.

* If I remember rightly, that is the year in which the ships will be completed, and when we begin to receive the 250,000 a year from the **British** Government - the money which the honorable member for Brisbane told us is to pay the interest and sinking fund.

* A few years ago  Mr. W.  H. Smith, a London bookseller, but a shrewd business man, .who amassed a fortune, had charge of the **British** Admiralty, and carried out some of the most effective reforms that the Admiralty has ever known.

* The Minister in this Bill has undoubtedly set a model before the **British** world.

* His measure is leading the **British** world on the question of defence, and he ought not to resist proposals for its improvement as if they represented organized obstruction on an ordinary party measure.

* The honorable and learned member for Corinella said that mining directors of **British** companies would naturally exhibit some sympathy for **British** firms.

* The big battleships of the **British** Squadron go there annually for their target practice.

* I am sure that the Government, as well as the people of the Commonwealth, would desire that the naval forces of Australia should operate in complete harmony with the **British** naval forces, and under the command of the Admiral on the station, in any naval war.

* There might be no Australian ships available for the naval brigades which are being trained here, but in the absence of Australian ships an opportunity to place them under the  command  of the Admiral for service on **British** ships should be readily availed of.

* Those words mean a test  mark equivalent to the mark used by the **British** Gunmakers' Association.

* It will permit of some mark other than the **British** test mark being placed upon these weapons - a mark which can be approved.

* An Imperial Zollverein, based upon preferences against the foreigner, would be' the beginning of the end of **British** commercial supremacy.

* The **British** trade with Australia was only 8 per cent, of its total, and the trade with Canada only 4 per cent, of  its total.

* Not only is this so, but the foreign trade of England is an increasing one, whilst the trade with **British** possessions is proportionately declining.

* Within the last 30 years the increase of English trade with America has amounted to 146 per cent., whilst the increase with **British** possessions has been less than 60 per cent.

* Let us take a rate, for example, based upon population and trade combined, and immediately the States entered this union their contribution with India and the other selfgoverning **British** possessions, instead of being one-sixtieth, would be something like one-sixth of the total.

* Had it not been for industrial legislation, limiting in some degree the employment of women and children in these factories, the fabric of the **British** Empire would have been shaken to its very base; for, say what we will, it cannot be denied that the basis of our national life rests upon our home life.

* It seems repugnant to the **British** spirit that a man should not be allowed to do what he likes with his own.

* In regard to part of the first item, ammunition and cartridges, the proportion of foreign imports, as compared with **British** imports, has largely increased.

* If the Government really desire to extend a preference to Great Britain, they intend to give to **British** trade a stimulus in the Australian market.

* It is obvious, therefore, that year after year he will be in a better position to compete with **British** goods in the Australian market.

* It seems to me that we are enticing **British** trade out of its ordinary channels, into new channels, which, by the very nature of the proposed preference, will, year by year, become less productive.

* I should like the Minister to insert in paragraph  d  the phraseology used in paragraph  g,  and thus provide that these barrels shall bear the **British** test mark.

* the Tariff Commission -was that barrels which did not bear the **British** test mark should pay a higher duty.

* The arguments used against the Government proposals are the same old arguments that have been used here ever since the first Parliament met, and are closely related to those which have been used in all **British** assemblies for many years past by those holding the opinions which have been enunciated by the members of the Opposition.

* During the consideration of the vote for the administration of **British** New Guinea, it was suggested that a Committee should be appointed to investigate certain statements as to the spread amongst the native population of diseases imported by the whites, and the enormous death-rate in the Northern Division of the Territory, for which no definite cause is assigned.

* I think that the Government should tell us what steps thev are taking to secure the recognition of **British** interests in those islands, and to bring about a different system of control.

* Have they taken such action as will induce the **British** authorities to give effect to the desire of the.

* Commonwealth that the islands shall as speedily as possible be brought under **British** control, and the dual control which now exists be done away with, bv a mutual' arrangement between France and Great Britain?

* In this item we are asked to give to **British** imports a preference of  10  per cent, as against cheap Swiss watches.

* I am told that there is no serious competition between Swiss and **British** watches, and that this duty will be a heavy tax on the poorer classes.

* He pointed out that between 19021 and 1904 the imports of **British** blue into Victoria had declined from 100,000 lbs.

* .- The statement was made yesterday that as soon as it was known in England that certain preferences had been given, cablegrams were sent out to Australia increasing prices to the amounts of the preferences, and if we make the general Tariff rate 5 per cent., and admit **British** importations free, the prices of **British** goods may be increased accordingly.

* In that case, Australia, as a section of the Empire, was interfering with the right of **British** subjects to enter **British** Dominions.

* The leader of the Labour Party himself admits that he keenly resented the Imperial representations- 
asked the Prime Minister,  upon notice -  1, Is it a fact that duty at the rate of 15 per cent, is being charged (and paid under pro-' test) on photographic dry plates and negatives (whether of foreign or **British** manufacture) notwithstanding that, under the new Tariff, the duty is only 5 per cent: on " foreign " imports, and "**British**" imports are free?

* All male inhabitants of Australia (excepting those who are exempted by this Act), who have resided therein for six months, and are **British** subjects, shall be liable to be trained, as prescribed, as follows :  - 
I would rather that a division should be taken now than that I should miss the opportunity of voting against the inclusion of these words in the inscription.

* The King is Emperor of India, but he is not Emperor of England, or Emperor of Scotland, or Emperor of any other part of the **British** Dominions.

* If the words " and Emperor '-' signify anything they signify that His Majesty is Emperor of that part of the **British** Dominions in which the coins are issued.

* Surely we ought' to mete out different treatment to the generous people of the **British** Isles, who are our own countrymen, and have raised no barriers against us, from that which we would mete out to foreigners.

* Restrictions against such immigration are in the interests of **British** immigrants themselves.

* I have just referred to the division lists in connexion with the vote taken on the proposal of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, in relation to the stipulation in the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Bill, that preference goods shall be earned in **British** ships manned by white seamen, and I find that not a single member of the Opposition voted for the provision.

* It is discipline, obedience to command, and bulldog tenacity that has brought the **British** people to the position which they hold.

* Every member of the Labour Party has sprung from **British** stock.

* We have the statement of the Admiral who was in charge of the **British** naval operations in China, that she is highly suitable for the purpose for which she was designed - the coastal defence of Australia.

* All the influence of **British** statesmen has been employed in urging us to do so.

* ; on goods dutiable at 15 per cent., the foreigner' would pay16 per cent., and the **British** 15 per cent.

* The Prime Minister be invited to obtain all data necessary for the preparation of a measure granting a preference to **British** imports into Australia which compete solely with imports from foreign countries.

* What we on this side propose, though not very much, is a concession in regard to all **British** goods upon which  ad valorem  duties are levied, and, if adopted, will enable us to know at the end of two or three years whether we should continue this policy as likely to be mutually advantageous to the mother country and Australia.

* I am not one of those who declaim from every platform about the great services that we owe to the mother country, while taking care to vote always to keep **British** goodsout of Australia, and to hamper **British** trade as much as possible.

* So far as I recollect, the objections urged against them by the right honorable member, who was then at the head of the Defence Department, were, first, that they were opposed to the spirit of the **British** Constitution, and, secondly, that they would cost a lot of money to carry into effect.

* At the present time we are protected from the aggression of foreign nations, first, by the **British** Fleet, and, secondly, by our own land forces.

* With regard to the 
**British** Fleet, our first and most important line of defence, it is only necessary to point out that it is magnificent, and that while it- maintains a position of superiority, we need have little or no fear of aggression.

* The **British** Navy, resting as it does on a prestige acquired by a series of victories at the end of the eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the like of which the world has never known, is now desperately struggling, to maintain a two-power standard.

* Captain Mahan points out that - and I emphasize this point, because it is the chief argument of those who object to any innovation such as I propose that whilst the **British** Fleet is here all is well - the **British** Navy, magnificent and powerful though it is, is nevertheless very much less powerful relatively than it was 100 years ago.

* He states that a century ago the **British** Navy was superior to the whole of the fleets of Europe put together.

* But the fact that we should now rely on the Japanese for the maintenance of **British** supremacy in eastern seas is not calculated to inspire with confidence those who have the ideal of a White Australia, and all that this term connotes.

* That the **British** Fleet is not all-powerful has been amply demonstrated by the Navy League of England.

* Since that country seems to gain fresh vigour with every advancing year, and to press more strongly on towards a goal which is only too obvious, it follows that as each year passes our reliance as a portion of the Empire on the **British** Fleet becomes less and less warranted.

* Therefore the **British** Fleet might be withdrawn from our coasts, and we left defenceless.

* When I submitted a similar proposal upon a previous occasion, the right honorable gentleman who was at the head of the Defence Department said that it was opposed to the spirit of the **British**.

* Instead of them being contrary to **British** traditions, they are in the highest degree in consonance with the old and admirable methods followed with such success in Great Britain for hundreds of years.

* The Commonwealth flag is regarded as an ensign to be used in the same way as the **British** ensign.

* The **British** ensign is not displayed from forts ; it has been the custom to display the ' Union Jack ; and, without further consideration, the Defence Department does.

* Government ought to stand as high, if we are going to be a great nation in this country, as that of the **British** Government.

* I do not think that a **British** House of Parliament ever appears to greater advantage than when it is displaying, as we are doing now, a most keen anxiety for the moral and spiritual welfare of those black races whom we so readily assimilate when our interests require us to do so.

* From all that "we have heard, one would think that it would have been infinitely better to allow the natives of New Guinea to remain as they were, without any colonization under ohe **British** flag.

* But the experience of Western Australia, where the State duty was 15 per cent., showed that Australian productions imported from other States could more than, hold their own with **British** and foreign productions in that market, and that the fruit industry there has been able to make great progress.

* I find, from the Western Australian  Statistical Register  for the year 1900, that the importations of bottled and tinned fruit into that State under a duty of 15 per cent, were 13,486 of **British** and foreign productions, and 21,903 of Australian productions.

* There are **British** consuls in Samoa, Tahiti, New Caledonia, and the Dutch East Indies, but none, so far as I am aware, in German New Guinea.

* That provision relates not to unfaircompetition, but to successful competition, such as we carry on in the **British** market.

* If our exports of butter to Great Britain are increased, will they not probably, or, indeed, certainly, lead to a diminution of **British** products to a corresponding extent?

* I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether any steps have been taken to appoint a **British** judge to the New Hebrides Joint Commission, and is it a fact that a French Judge has already been appointed?

* I should also like to know whether he will endeavour to have the centre of **British** administration transferred from Fiji to Sydney.

* But we do not slavishly follow **British** precedent, and, on the whole, we think it better to provide that the stamp used in cases of this sort shall be an impress stamp.

* If the honorable  member  thinks that we can prevent the **British** shipping companies from sweating their seamen he is more simple than I thought.

* If the **British** steam-ship owners made up their minds that our trade was worth having, it.

* They are **British** subjects, and will be welcome.

* The imports into Britain from **British** possessions for 1897' and 1S98 were 94,018,933, and from foreign countries, 357,010,027, or a total of 451,028,960.

* The exports of **British** products were 23"4,2.19,70S,and foreign and colonial products, 59,954,410, or a total ex:port of..294-, 174, 118, making a surplus of imports over exports; 156,854,842; or adding re-exports, foreign and colonial, amounting to 59,954,410, which ought properly to be included, a total of 216,809,252.

* In Austria and Hungary it was adopted in 1882, and a large number of **British** firms, finding themselves shut out of the Austrian market, shifted their  plants over to  Austria, and opened out their industries there.

* We find that in neutral markets the manufactures of protected countries are outrivaling **British** manufactures.

* The writer of  Drifting  says - 
No doubt the Commonwealth can acquire territory just in the same way as the **British** Government can acquire territory in Sydney Harbor; but the State, nevertheless, has control over that territory.

* I desire to ask the Prime Minister with reference to the grave condition of affairs in the New Hebrides disclosed by his reply to a question put by the honorable member for Mernda yesterday, whether the Government have made any protest to the **British** Colonial Office against its attitude of apparent apathy and indifference to **British** and Australian interests in the islands.

* Strong representations were made to the Imperial authorities, and soon afterwards an agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co., whereby the lands belonging to that company in the group were thrown open for **British** settlement.

* The situation was thereby temporarily saved, for the influx of the new colonists turned the tide in favour of **British** supremacy.

* It passed a Tariff which very properly put a high duty on foreign grown maize and coffee, but as it neglected to provide any rebate on **British** grown produce entering Australia from die New Hebrides, it showed in the most practical fashion that it regarded the **British** settlers it had enticed there as no better than foreigners and enemies.

* She has lately offered **British** settlers the same rights and privileges as their French rivals now enjoy if they will become naturalized as French subjects.

* The **British** settlers, on the other hand, are heavily handicapped, because they cannot send their produce to French ports without paying heavy duties, and Australia, instead of giving them treatment similar to that given to the French settlers by France, has raised against them a Tariff wall, which keeps out their products, and these are then thrown back on their hands, often to rot, because in that climate maize cannot be kept very longwithout being spoiled.

* Therefore, not only are great inducements held out to the **British** settlers to forget that they are Britishers, and to remember that they are being treated by Australia as aliens and outcasts; but the people are being tempted by the fear of starvation and destitution to avail themselves of the undoubted advantages which would follow French naturalization.

* The **British** settlers are growing tired of being penalized and ruined for their patriotism.

* We are loth to believe that anything could induce a body of **British** subjects to renounce their nationality; but there can be no doubt that the **British** settlers in the New Hebrides are very sore at the unjust treatment which the Commonwealth has meted out to them.

* At the present time a petition is in course of signature in the islands which is intended to be forwarded to  Mr. Deakin,  asking for preferential tariff treatment of **British** grown produce.

* The Federal Government should immediately introduce a short Bill granting a substantial rebate of the Tariff on all **British** grown produce entering Australia from the New Hebrides.

* Interests which go to the very root of our future national welfare demand that **British** occupation of the New Hebrides should be paramount and permanent.

* This can only be effected by opening our markets to the **British** settlers.

* In no other way can **British** development of the islands be .promoted.

* In that opinion, I am supported by the statements contained in letters sent by **British** residents in the New Hebrides to friend's in Australia, and, in particular, by a letter which I have received from the brother of a settler, who has been kind enough to give me a good deal of information about the conditions of settlement in the New Hebrides.

* At that time no national complications could have arisen from the hoisting of the **British** flag upon islands which are now in the possession of foreign Powers.

* In many cases where the **British** flag was hoisted, the **British** authorities did not appreciate the hold that they had upon the islands, and' some were afterwards practically filched from them.

* And it is indisputable that they were largely discovered, surveyed, charted, and missionised by **British** effort, and at **British** cost.

* Gradually the islands to which I have referred have passed away from the **British** sway, and have been brought under foreign control.

* If we are not very careful, they will pass away absolutely from us, by reason of there probably being in a short time no longer any **British** interests in the islands to be safeguarded.

* I wish to quote a "letter which I have received from a settler in the New Hebrides, who says - 
The situation in the group, from a **British** and Australian stand-point, is one of extreme gravity.

* Small wonder that these ruined men are bitter in soul, and in the struggle between patriotism and destitution, are strongly tempted to yield to French inducements to change their allegiance from the **British** to the French flag.

* The main point dealt with is the unsatisfactory condition of **British** development here, owing to the abandonment of plantations in embryo by men who have exhausted their capital, and find it impossible to continue planting, through the lack of a market to which they can send their produce, such as maize, millet, &amp;c. Another argument touched upon is the danger of a movement being inaugurated among **British** settlers to assist the French in their efforts to obtain complete control of the group.

* The most gigantic " Yes-no " of Australian politics is that of the present Government, who went round this continent clamouring for the policy of shutting the door against the manufactures of the mother country by means of higher duties on **British** manufactures, and then sent there representatives who, in the presence of millions of people, having upon them all the burdens of empire, clamoured for fresh taxation upon them.

* They knew also that the **British** Government had been commissioned by the people of England to shut this door of preference.

* When the **British** Parliament met, the principle of free-trade and the freedom of raw materials and food from taxation was affirmed by the House of Commons by 478 to 98 - the most enormous majority ever known on any great question of national policy.

* They did not go Home to meet **British** Ministers who were clinging to office with a wretched minority of supporters.

* The two gentlemen who represented us knew that they would not be called upon to prove their- sincerity by stating what they were prepared to do; and when they found this triple-bolted door of **British** oak they kicked and screamed and knocked, praying all the time, " For God's sake, do not open it."

* Let us consider what the position would have been if the **British** Ministers had responded to that eloquence, and had said, ' ' We wish to make this family arrangement with you - the people of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales are prepared to come to a friendly understanding, and are anxious for Australian wheat, without regard to their own starving farmers, and we have a mandate from the people,  Mr. Deakin,  to do what* you ask - what will you do?"

* I make nothing of the fact that the Australian Ministers were the guests of the **British** Government; indeed, they were not the guests of the **British** Government, but the guests of the **British** nation.

* On what basis could those statesmen, brought from all quarters of the **British** Empire, go outside the doors of the Council chamber in order to help the political interests of a great political party?

* If, I say, the **British** Prime Minister and- the BritishTreasurer had taken any such action in this great city we should have had the staff of the  Age  tearing the Union Jack to tatters,, trampling it in the mud, and demanding  airimmediate  repeal of the Union.

* What is the one principle - simple though it be - which extends to all the Dominions of the **British** Empire?

* It is dishonest, it is hollow, and there is not a man who stands in the front rank of this movement in the present Government or in this city of Melbourne, who would take onefiftieth per cent, off a single duty that touches an article of **British** manufacture to-day.

* I do not want to say a single word against the able gentleman who is at present at the head of these Forces, but it was a thousand pities that when that office was vacant the Government did not get the best officer in the **British** Empire of the kind I have described to fill the position.

* It is one of the certainties of our development that we shall have a Navy of our own, but what gigantic meanness there is in the suggestion that because we want a navy of our own we should not pay anything towards the **British** fleets that do defend us !

* Australia never reached a lower depth of absolute gigantic meanness - the statesmanship of the coster-monger - than when we couple the question of an Australian Navy with getting out of a solemn Act of Parliament, out of giving our little childhood's mite towards the enormous responsibilities which rest on the people in those **British** islands who have to support the whole weight of the Empire and defend us- 
Why should the two things be coupled?

* I say to those of us who talk as loyal men - and many outside went out to risk their lives in standing by the old  country  - surely a nation that has  shed its blood for England can pay this little mite towards the cost of the **British** 
I am now speaking for myself.

* In Great Britain, the increase in the export of manufactures, during a period of three years, has been as follows : - In 1904, 243,000,000 ; in 1905, 269,000,000; and in 1906, 305,000,000, showing an increase of 62,000,000 in the **British** export of manufactured goods in three years.

* In that grand old country in less than three years, there was a greater increase of **British** manufactured exports- 
I believe that it is a good deal higher, and "therefore I do not wish to push that argument unfairly- against the Government.

* If we show that we are animated by feelings similar to those which animate the people of Canada, our proposals may make headway with the **British** people; but if we try to expose their fiscal policy to ridicule, and endeavour to show that young Australia can teach them a great deal that they do not know, the reverse may happen.

* I may tell you,  Mr. Speaker,  and the gentlemen on the opposite side, that there are so many difficulties in connexion with mining that I am not surprised at the necessity of employing, if anything, cheaper labour than, perhaps, the **British** people would be able to afford.

* **British** possession " shall mean any part of the King's dominions exclusive of the United Kingdom, and where ports of such dominions are under both a central and a local Legislature all parts under the central Legislature shall for the purposes of this definition be deemed to be one **British** possession :  
New Zealand, we shall not prove recreant to our duty and protestations in regard to the mother country.

* Interfere with the free intercourse of **British** products throughout the Empire, and you ringbark the great Imperial tree under whose shade we are sheltering from the heat of the world's enmity.

* It is notorious that tobacco is purchasable, free of duty, by the crews upon any **British** ships.

* When the **British** flag was planted c.n these shores, only one Colony existed, but later, Victoria was separated from New South Wales, and then Queensland, while other Colonies were established in the west.

* Only recently I read an article in one pf the English economic journals in regard to the operations of the **British** Post Office, in which it ' was pointed out that the penny postage system was the great " stand-by " from the point of view of.

* It may be information to honorable members to learn that something like two-fifths of the total number of words despatched over the **British** telegraph lines comprise press messages, which return only about 5 per cent, of the revenue derived from other sources.

* I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has invited the **British** Government to arrange for the special representation of the **British** Navy in Australian waters during the visit .

* What was the number of passengers carried by oversea **British** and foreign ships coastwise in the Commonwealth during 1903, distinguishing the numbers carried by **British** or by foreign ships as far as is possible?

* Whether the Government are aware' that the **British** Acting Resident of the New Hebrides'  has stated that nothing has injured the **British**  position in the Islands so much as the Federal Tariff?

* The effect of this provision will be that **British** goods to which preference will apply must be imported direct in **British** ships manned exclusively by white seamen.

* What was the number of passengers carried by oversea **British** and foreign ships coastwise in the Commonwealth during 1903, distinguishing the numbers carried by **British** or by foreignships as is possible ?

* It is quite true, no doubt, that criticism does lie against the **British** Empire in that it has never hesitated to stretch out a predatory hand to gather fresh territories into its already over laden arms.

* I do say that both those who look to the future of this country as a part of the **British** Empire, and those who, perhaps, have other aspirations, ought seriously to consider the necessity of putting our house in order.

* Only the other day, too, we were informed that the **British** Government had sent a Commission to Switzerland to examing and inquire into the working of the Swiss system.

* The Prime Minister would not allow the people to have the right which a Britisher might expect in **British** territory - the right to say whether he shall consume what he believes to be good for him.

* Are we to understand that the prohibition party in this House is willing to establish a monopoly in drink in **British** New Guinea?

* That manufacturer came here because he was offered inducements, and it is claimed that **British** countries keep an honest contract with honest men.

* We have no recourse pen to us but totake over the control of **British** New 
Guinea, and in view of the fact that the island is so close to our shores, I am sorry that we cannot assume the control of the whole of it.

* I think that as a nation we have many things to be ashamed of in connexion with our treatment of inferior coloured races whom, in many cases, we have civilized out of existence, but still the students of modem history who pay attention to the methods adopted in dealing with barbarous peoples admit that the **British** nation has been the most successful' in handling subject races.

* That is the mistake that has been made here, and, so far as **British** New Guinea is concerned, it would be a mistake not only from the point of view of principle, but from the stand-point of colonization.

* There seems to be always a danger in relation 'to officialdom which is at any distance from the controlling centre, and 1 think we should leave some loop-hole through which genuine grievances on the part of the people of **British** New Guinea may reach the fountain head here.

* There can be ' no doubt that we all have an innate love of what we describe as **British** justice.

* Such a proposition is altogether foreign to our ideas of **British** justice.

* Yes, the rifle adopted by the **British** War Office.

* I am pointing out that our present position is due entirely to the fault of Ministers, and I am prepared to abide by the result of an appeal to any constitutional authority, in any part of the **British** Empire, as to the correctness of the procedure which we have followed.

* I believe thoroughly in establishing reciprocal relations between the Commonwealth and other **British** dependencies occupying a similar position.

* The effect of the agreement will be that we shall have to pay a heavy duty upon the very considerable quantity of **British** cheese which is imported.

* I should like to see a reciprocal' arrangement entered into with the mother country and other parts of the **British** Empire.

* In my judgment, our people have wisely determined to 'retain their European characteristics, and to maintain the **British** standard of living.

* The whole of the **British**-owned press in Japan is strongly advocating the utilization of **British** and Australian manufactures.

* amongst other things - 
The Prime Minister stated the other evening that the whole question of our trade relations with the New Hebrides would be considered in connexion with the proposal to encourage **British** settlement in those islands.

* Rather than waste two or three hours in debating it, I move - 
When we are framing a Constitution for **British** New Guinea, and that I understand is the object of this Bill, we should deal with the matter in a sensible fashion, and honorable members should not attempt to impose upon the citizens of the Territory disabilities which they would not inflict upon the citizens of Australia.

* of **British** New Guinea, they will do nothing which will lead to illicit distillation.

* I remind honorable members that there is an inland border, extending for 800 or 900 miles between Dutch New Guinea and **British** New Guinea, and it will be impossible to prevent natives being engaged in the smuggling of spirits across that border.

* us by the Mother Country, and what she is doing for us at present, the time has not arrived in the history of this young Commonwealth when prohibitive duties should be raised against **British** manufactures.

* But if honorable members take the trouble to read the evidence they will find that, so far from our manufacturers being in a comparatively bad position, they are in a much better position than that occupied by the **British** manufacturer.

* The Australian woollen manufacturer can go into the wool market almost at any time of the year,and buy what he requires, whereas the **British** manufacturer has to pay insurance, freight and other charges on the wool to England, and similar charges, together with the duty,when he desires to get his finished product into the Australian market.

* That the word " public" be inserted before the word " seal," line o, and that the M'ords " LieutenantGovernor," line 5, be omitted with a view to insert the words " Possession of **British** New Guinea in use before this Act. "

* New Caledonia accords better treatment to the products of the French settlers in the New Hebrides than the Commonwealth does to the products of **British** settlers.

* French policy and funds will render more assistance in such a struggle than **British** policy or Australian funds.

* In some other parts of the world, however, where **British** interests are comparatively small, the interests of France are important.

* I think it was Conan Doyle who some time ago suggested that a statue should be erected in London to Kruger, as the man who federated the **British** Empire.

* Within the past three or four years the **British** Empire has been federated, and federated in such a way as could never have been accomplished by Act of Parliament.

* The reason why no feeling of the kind would be entertained is that the people of England would realize that these men represent the thousands who at the present moment are in South Africa defending the **British** Empire.

* In the framing of their legislation the **British** people do not treat us as if we were depredators engaged in a vendetta against their enterprises and their industrial occupations.

* Then the American owners succeeded in getting a very large subsidy from the United States Government, under the conditions of which the **British** ships then running on the San Francisco line had to retire.

* I am at one with the Prime Minister in the opinion that for the next two years, at any rate, until we have re-arranged our mail contracts, it is desirable to continue this **British** connexion across the Pacific with a **British** colony, especially since that colony is willing to so largely assist us in subsidizing these steamers'.

* If a **British** medical man, possessing even the best qualifications, wishes to practise in Germany or France, the doors of those countries are not thrown open to him.

* attend them, yet a **British** doctor with the highest qualifications must pass the whole of the examinations that a native German or Frenchman must pass Defore he is allowed to practise there.

* foreign countries with regard to **British** medical men.

* The Minister, in quoting from the **British** and South Australian Acts, entirely misled the Committee as to the powers they confer when compared with those which he seeks to acquire.

* I ask the honorable gentleman again to be content with the powers conferred under the **British** and South Australian Acts.

* The South Australian Legislature was content to follow the **British** precedent, but the honorable gentleman is going one better in insisting on a drag-net provision, which will make it im- possible for us to do business with outside countries.

* Panama is of the highest importance to **British** and Australian commercial interests.

* That the strategical position of the New Hebrides Group, with their exceptional harbor facilities, renders it imperative, in the interests of **British** and Australian commerce, that their control shall not pass into the hands of a foreign naval power.

* That, for the foregoing reasons, it is desirable to provide every reasonable facility for the promotion of **British** and Australian settlement in the New Hebrides Group.

* It was with that object in view that I took an active part in the movement to establish **British** supremacy in the Pacific some years ago, and at intervals, during the last twenty years I have endeavoured to arouse public interest in regard to the importance of these islands to Australia from the stand-point I have named.

* The New Hebrides Group should really belong to Great Britain, not only by right of discovery and by reason of the enormous sums that have been expended on mission work and in establishing trading facilities, but by priority of **British** settlement, and the fact that the **British** Admiralty has spent large sums in surveying and correctly charting the islands. '

* But, unfortunately, notwithstanding the frequent representations made by- leading statesmen in Australia, no attempt has been made by the **British** authorities to annex those valuable islands to the **British**' Crown, and they have gradually been encroached upon by foreign powers.

* The representations that were first made, years ago, to the **British** authori ties as to the future importance of these islands as affecting Australian and **British** interests were not received in a very cordial spirit.

* And yet within the short space of four years after such an expression of opinion on the part of the **British** Minister, foreign Powers began to establish themselves in the Islands.

* That firm has given every facility to **British** settlers, as well as to settlers who have gone from Australia, to develop those islands with the object of establishing their effective occupation, and that should be some justification for our appealing to Great Britain to intervene, in order to prevent their falling into the hands of a foreign Power.

* The geographical position of Australia makes her the natural warden of the Pacific, and it is to be regretted that so many of the valuable islands in those waters have been allowed to pass absolutely into foreign control, when, by the exercise of a little wise statesmanship on the part of the **British** authorities, a few years ago, they all might have been under **British** control.

* When **British** settlers complain of the different treatment which is meted out to them in comparison with French settlers, naturally the latter  say  - " Well, that is a complaint which you legitimately have against the **British** Government.

* It speaks well  for the patriotism of the **British** settlers who are labouring under these disabilities that so far they have resisted all the temptations held out to them to transfer their allegiance from the **British** to a foreign flag.

* I suppose that they desire to see this territory pass under **British** control, and do not like to think of a great naval foreign power being firmly established in such close proximity to the shores of Australia, from which most of the settlers went to establish new homes.

* In connexion with these disabilities, it will be remembered that about last November a petition was presented by the **British** settlers to the right honorable member for East Sydney when he was Prime Minister.

* As the oldest resident **British** planter in the New Hebrides, I can assure you, sir, that the views expressed in the petition but faintly convey the anxiety that obtains throughout the group as to the attitude which the Commonwealth of Australia intends to adopt towards us.

* The fact that the French settlers outnumber the **British** by forty-one, the numbers being - French 255, **British** 214.

* That by subsidies and superior transport facilities the French subjects are given far more encouragement than their **British** rivals.

* I think that the voice of the missionaries has also a right to be heard, for it must be remembered that nearly all the islands in the South Pacific Ocean were originally Christianized and colonized by **British** missionaries at the cost of many tens of thousands of pounds and the loss of many valuable lives.

* Of course, when they do reach maturity, the **British** settlers will be able to carry on the work of the development of the islands under far more favorable conditions than they can do at present.

* Not from  a  **British** stand-point, perhaps, but certainly he may be so called from the stand-point of the country of his adoption.

* Although of Irish origin, he became enamoured of the French flag, and cast  in  his lot with the French people ; and there is no doubt that the French owe to the efforts of this natural **British** subject much of the settlement and development that has taken place  in  New Caledonia, as well as the settlement that has taken place  on  account of France in the New Hebrides.

* **British** control.

* About October, 1894,  Dr. Macdonald  was asked by Captain Rason, the **British** Commissioner, to report as to the conditions prevailing between the French settlers and his mission, and a copy of the report has been forwarded by  Dr. Macdonald  in a letter written to a friend of his,  the Rev.

* Referring to the French having taken possession of land belonging to this particular mission station of the Presbyterian Church,  Dr. Macdonald  says : - 
It will be seen that, prior to this report,  Dr. Macdonald  had reason to complain of French aggression upon **British** territory, and of French interference with **British** settlers.

* These extracts show unmistakably that, in addition to the disabilities which, unfortunately, !we have .placed tin :the way of **British** settlers getting a natural market for their products, they have also to labour under the disability of French aggression, which they are not in a position to resist.

* I am credibly informed that further encroachments on the rights of **British**- Australian settlers have taken place quite recently.

* Unfortunately, we are not in a position to give any such guarantee of protection to **British** or Australian settlers.

* Wherever attempts are made on the part of Australian or **British** settlers to colonize islands, such colonization being in the interests of the **British** Empire and of **British** unity, it should be the endeavour of every patriotic citizen of  the Empire to afford the colonists every possible assistance.

* Having dealt with the circumstances which led up to the proposed agreement betwen the two nations, a writer in this newspaper goes on to say - 
Until we get sufficient authority from the **British** authorities at Home.

* In connexion with the visit of a French warship to the New Hebrides, I might inform the House that, whereas on previous occasions only those portions of the islands exclusively occupied by French settlers have been visited, on the last cruise those portions inhabited by **British** settlers were also visited.

* The New Hebrides would then pass absolutely under **British** control, and if the Imperial Government so desired, the Commonwealth Government might administer them subject to that control.

* Dr. Hahl  is the Governor who last year gained considerable notoriety by the issue of an official circular, appealing to his friends, subordinates, and employes to abolish the use of the English language, and to eradicate **British** influence in their colonies.

* Also in connexion with this matter, another article appeared in the newspapers about that time, wherein reference was made to the departure of a **British** missionary, as follows: - 
Much regret is felt by the **British** settlers of New Britain at the announced retirement from the field of missionary labours of the Rev.

* There is another aspect of the question to which I would direct attention, and that is the strategic importance of these islands from the point of view of the defence of Australia and of **British** commerce in the Pacific, which is sure to develop very largely in the near future.

* Thus infinitely greater value will attach to the islands adjacent to that route, not only from the trade point of view, because trade with Australia will probably be developed all along the line by vessels coming through the canal from Great Britain and other countries, but also owing to the necessity for effectively policing the Pacific and protecting **British** trade.

* At the present time there are established in the vicinity of that route several foreign naval Powers, all of  which possess islands that afford naval bases, from which they could successfully operate against **British** commerce in time of war.

* If this harbor and the other splendid harbors which exist in these islands were allowed to pass into the possession of a foreign Power which might - let us hope that it never would - come into conflict with Great Britain, and a disastrous war were to result, the whole of the **British** commerce in the South Pacific would be completely at the mercy of the enemy.

* For this reason it is of the very greatest importance that we should endeavour to induce the **British** authorities to interest themselves in this question from the point of view, not only of Australia, but of **British** commercial interests, which will be threatened by the foreign occupation of islands adjacent to the main highway of the Pacific, and which will be opened up by the Panama Canal.

* By reason of priority of **British** settlement, by reason of the large sums which have been expended by the **British** in developing, Christianizing, and surveying these islands, as well as by reason of discovery, I think we have the first claim to their possession.

* It has gone forth to the world that we were giving a particular preference, and.no doubt some of the **British** firms have based their calculations thereon.

* I think that, as far as possible, we ought to maintain the preference which **British** people have been led to understand was being offered to them.

* It is a leading principle of responsible government in the **British** Parliament that there must be no interference of any kind with the Government, and in many cases no information is given whilst matters are in progress towards settlement.

* Therefore, according to **British** precedent, the surrender of the Government in this matter involves a clear departure from the principles of responsible government as practised at the heart of the Empire.

* We are surrendering quietly and weakly the principles of responsible 'government as it has been worked in **British** communities up to date; and when the mischief is done - if mischief it be; and so far we have not evolved any scheme to take the place of our present system of parliamentary government - it will not be because the present system is faulty, but because we have not worked it as we ought to have done, and as it has been worked in other parts of the world.

* The bulk of the harvesterimporting business is concentrated in the hands of the Massev-Harris Company, which is a **British** company.

* Now, however, we find that the **British** trade in harvesters is being directly challenged.

* -  **British** trade?

* We do not profess that we want to introduce **British** goods to displace the goods made by the manufacturers of Canada.

* protectionist- party which are now in power come forward with this socalled offer of preference to **British** goods.

* A number of the articles named are already free under our Tariff, and, in effect, the Government say, " We will continue to allow these goods - so long as they are of **British** origin and are brought here in **British** ships - to be admitted free, but we will levy a duty upon them as against the foreigner."

* Does the honorable member suggest that we should give unconditional preference to **British** goods ?

* There is nothing which I should hail with greater delight than the granting of unconditional preference to **British** goods.

* I speak in this way because I read the other day a statement to the effect that the **British** Government contemplated in February next summoning a Colonial Conference to meet in the month of July.

* If there were any prospect of the **British** Government being successfully returned, I should not have anything to say, except that we ought to keep clear of the matter until the elections have taken place.

* Take the case of  Mr. Jellicoe,  a former resident of New Zealand, and a candidate for a **British** constituency, who came to Australia the other day, and expressed an opinion regarding our politics.

* The Agents-General of the States attacked him in the **British** press, and we altogether repudiated his intervention as * that of an impertinent meddler.

* So far as I know, shoddy is not produced in Australia, and if we want to cater for the poorer classes, and afford to local manufacturers, a chance to compete with **British** manufacturers, we cannot give less protection than is proposed, for the simple reason that the latter largely use Yorkshire shoddy Surely honorable members cannot say that in thatcase 7d.

* To my mind, it is desirable that we should place our views fully and freely before the **British** public.

* I am not prepared to vote for any scheme of prefer ence which will keep **British** goods out  of  our markets.

* The people  of  England have been led to expect that Australia is prepared to give them such preference as will improve the position of the **British** manufacturer by enabling him  to  send more goods into our markets.

* In speaking of the Colonies,  Mr. Balfour  said - 
I have quoted these statements for the express purpose of showing that the representations which have been made by the leaders of the preferential trade movement in Great Britain is that the preference we are prepared to concede is of a genuine and substantial character, which will considerably improve the position of the **British** manufacturer.

* When the Canadian manufacturers of woollen goods found that the **British** imports were interfering with their operations, they immediately demanded that the duty should be increased.

* I certainly anticipate that effect will be given to the promise which has been made, and that in return- for any reduction of the existing duties in favour of the mother country, we shall receive a preference in the **British** market.

* If a proposal were made that we should abolish all duties upon **British** manufactured goods, conditionally upon that country granting to us a substantial preference, I should be quite prepared to fall in with it.

* It must not be supposed that the Protectionist Party, though rejoicing that England appears to be prepared to adopt protection; will be ready to make any concessions in regard to duties on **British** manufactures.

* It is the **British** manufacturer they fear.

* Had it not been for the efforts of the Free-trade Party, the duties on **British** manufactures would have, in many cases, been twice as high as now.

* It is **British** hats, woollen goods, apparel, starch, furniture, and tobacco that the Australian protectionist fears.

* In other words,  89  per cent, of our imports in this direction are of **British** origin.

* The Tariff schedule was framed to keep out **British** and foreign goods.

* In the ordinary course of events, three-fifths of these goods would come from Great Britain, so that at this time the object of the Protectionist Party was to shut out3.000,000 worth of **British** goods from the Australian market.

* Does not the interjection just made by the honorable member for Bourke bear out the contention which I have put before the House, that the policy which I believe he honestly and squarely favours is to shut out **British** products from Australia wherever that can be done?

* He was one of those who objected to **British** goods coming into Australia, and the Free-trade Party had to fight him and others before they could secure these reductions.

* Did they ever call for a division in favour of reducing the duties so far as **British** goods were concerned ?

* Other reductions were also made, which were opposed" toy the Protectionist Party, who desired to keep out **British** goods.

* If it had not been reduced, it would have  had  the effect, to some extent, of keeping **British** imports out of this market.

* A Protectionist Government proposed fixed and composite duties on vehicles, which ranged from  20  per cent, to  80  per cent., and would have largely excluded vehicles of **British** manufacture.

* The instances which I have given show that the Protectionist Party were, during the consideration of the Tariff, seeking to practically exclude from this market not only foreign, but also **British** goods.

* The **British** shipping industry, which was responsible for the settlement of these Colonies, and is the chief glory of Great Britain, so that with its decay **British** prestige and rule would come to an end, is one to which the Protectionist Party through its leaders, in the last Parliament, promised to give favorable consideration.

* At the Colonial Conference, the visiting Premiers passed resolutions, affirming that special concessions should be granted to **British** ships in the coastal trade of the Colonies, and in the trade between the Empire and the Colonies; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.

* He pointed out that their motto was " Ships, Colonies and Commerce," and he told them that they did right to place colonies in so close a juxtaposition with ships and commerce, and referred to the promise of the then Prime Minister of Australia, that he would regard and assist the interests of **British** shipping.

* But when he was making that speech, the Australian Government had on the stocks a Bill whose aim and object was to hamper **British** vessels engaged in the coastal trade of Australia.

* 'The most casual perusal of that measure shows that it was the intention of the Government which introduced it, and which made a placard of its loyalty to the **British** shipping interest, to deal a deadly blow at that industry.

* The provisions of the Navigation Bill, if * assented to, would have precluded **British** ships from engaging in the coastal trade of Australia.

* That Government had shown by their action in taxing ships' stores, that they wished to hamper **British** ships engaged in their Australian coastal trade, and the passing of the Navigation Bill would practically have prevented **British** shipping from trading in our waters.

* So that, not only; has the Protectionist Party endeavoured to shut out **British** imports, but they have endeavoured to prevent **British** shipping from engaging in our coastal trade.

* Had the Navigation Bill been carried, serious injury would have been inflicted upon the **British** mercantile marine.

* What Australia should desire is to see Ohe **British** mercantile marine prosperous and progressive.

* The **British** Navy is recruited from her mercantile marine, and the more vigorous and prosperous the latter is, the tighter will be the bonds which unite us with the mother country, and the better the opportunities which the **British** Navy will have to obtain able and skilful seamen.

* Not only would the Navigation Bill have inflicted injury upon **British** commerce, but it would have done great harm to our own producers.

* These facts should be made known to the **British** people.

* They should understand that a large section of the party which says that it favours preference, favours a most one-sided and delusive preference, and one which will not increase **British** exports to Australia, or **British**, trade in Australian waters.

* It was such a preference as that which  Mr. Chamberlain  had in view,  when he said, " Give work to the **British** workers, and increase the imports into Australia of **British** manufactures."

* He has said that unless a tax is put on food) separation cannot be prevented, and I think that we cannot make it too plain that that is not our view of the case, that although we believe that a tax on food would be greatly to the advantage of our farmers, their loyalty would not be diminished if the **British** people abstained from so taxing themselves.

* Does the honorable member think that **British** manufacturers and' ship-owners are so stupid that they will be taken in by a preference which will not give them freer access to our markets?

* Reference has been made to the closure rule in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, but it must be recollected that that Parliament guides,, not only the affairs of the United Kingdom, with a population of 45,000,000, but also the destinies of the **British** Empire, and that the consideration of foreign and colonial policies must absorb a very large portion of its time.

* When it is recollected that the population of the **British** Empire ranges from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000, it will be recognised that drastic steps must be taken in the **British** Parliament to limit debate; otherwise important proposals could not possibly be discussed or decided.

* I have no objection- to such criticism, because I remember that the information published by the  Pall Mall Gazette  in regard to the position of the **British** Navy - information which  Mr. Stead  had obtained from Lord Charles Beresford - led to that Navy being completely revolutionizeld.

* There have also been some outspoken utterances in regard to the condition of the **British** military forces.

* I think that our defence must always rest largely in the protection afforded us by the **British** Navy, which is the admiration of the world.

* The Attorney-General clearly put it before the House that he could see that a difficulty would probably arise with the **British** Government if we included in the Bill the principle contained in the proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney, and he proposed that the matter should be dealt with by a provision merely stating that any proposed mail contracts should be brought before the House, and submitted for discussion, before they were accepted by the Government.

* So far as my own personal feeling goes I would employ not only white people but **British** subjects as far as it is possible.

* I believe that white men are quite capable of doing the work in the stoke-holes of these steamers, and I would have gone further than the honorable member for West Sydney has gone, by providing that all men employed in connexion with these steamers, whether for coaling or other purposes, should be white men and **British** subjects.

* (**British** New Guinea) Bill.

* It had reference to the alienation of land in **British** New Guinea.

* What I said was that our imports from all sources, exclusive of bullion, are valued at about 37,000,000, of which **British** imports represent a value of about 23,000,000.

* This may happen to a **British** subject.

* It is monstrous that a ship-master should be compelled, if goods of **British** manufacture which form part of his cargo are to receive a preference from Australia, to cashier some unfortunate wretch who may have been onhis ship for years.

* An autocratic system such as that would not be tolerated in a **British** community, and we have to make some provision for that continuity of policy which is not to be found in the **British** Empire, but which prevails in Germany.

* The Minister for Home Affairs has said that regulations can be framed in regard to a Board of Advice ; but the **British** Commission declares that regulations in relation to such a matter are of no avail.

* He declares that what is good enough for England should be good enough for Australia ; but I venture to say that no Army Bill will be dealt with in the **British** Parliament without very serious consideration being given to the Commission's report.

* The reason why we have not had a provision of this kind before in England is that the Government acted on the advice of the English Prince Consort, who said that we must adhere to the German "model - that we must keep the position of CommanderinChief of the **British** Army in Royal hands.

* The **British** Government, of course, broke away from that system after the retirement of the Duke of Cambridge, by appointing Lord Wolseley to the position of Commander - in - Chief, and that soldier was in turn succeeded by Lord Roberts.

* Ought we not to encourage the connexion which we desire to maintain under the **British** flag ?

* I have no interest whatever in this matter, except that I desire to see our connexion with the South Sea Islands kept up and **British** influence maintained.

* We do not wish to lay it down that they shall be **British** subjects.

* In Sydney at Commonwealth time I saw the honorable member for Wentworth waving his hat when the **British** tars were marching in the procession.

* What about the men on our **British** warships, which go up through Torres Straits and the Gulf of Carpentaria?

* This provision would apply mostly to **British** vessels ; foreign vessels, for the most part, would not be interfered with.

* We should interfere with **British** ships, for instance, with the boats of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and tie them up, while we allowed foreign vessels, employing cheap labour - not perhaps " so cheap as coloured labour, but very much cheaper than ordinary wharf labour - to discharge or load, and get away.

* I see no reason why, in the near future, the Commonwealth should not be able to  borrow money at rates on a par with those ruling for **British** Consols.

* I do not think the **British** money-lenders, or money-lenders in any part of the world, would ever be afraid to lend money to federated Australia, so long as we- show in our financial operations that we are governed by reason and caution, and are determined to see that our present debt is not added to unless for the purpose of large national works.

* Instead of setting up a sham Navy of our own, which would be absolutely useless, it would be far better for us to contribute a fair share towards the maintenance of the **British** Navy, and develop anAustralian Squadron under the control of the **British** Admiralty.

* We shall best conserve out interests in the matter of naval defence by contributing more largely to the support of the **British** Navy.

* Is the care of the **British** race intrusted to the few persons who comprise this Parliament?

* Is the **British** Parliament, and the Parliaments, of all the other **British** dominions, of no importance as compared with us?

* At the same time we have to regard this matter from the stand-point of **British** law, which introduces a totally new element, namely, that of how far the Crown is to be taxed, because, after all, when a State imports goods it is the Crown, as represented by that State, which is importing those goods.

* I took part in the last division following the expression of my own view, that in dealing with this matter, it is not proper to discriminate between one class of **British** subjects and another, merely on account of race.

* At present the **British** Shipping Conference, in which foreign shipping, is represented, regulates the Australian passenger traffic, not specially for the convenience of Australians, but rather to meet the necessities of its many and varied interests in the East and elsewhere.

* Even though the defendant might not be aware of -.the falsity of the entry the very fact of- its being false in any particular would render him liable to six months0 imprisonment, and now we find that under this clause it is provided, against all the accepted rules of **British** law,, that the onus of proof that he is not guilty is to be on the defendant.

* The committee refused to alter a clause just now with regard to witnesses, but I am sure that- the spirit of **British** fair play, which I think imbues, every member of this committee, will not allow them to pass a clause like this.

* Is there any law in any **British** speaking community that throws the onus of proof upon the defendant instead of on the prosecutor1?

* I take it we are here to legislate in conformity with the principles of **British** justice, free speech, and fair discussion.

* to think that there is no necessity here for such an Act as we are told was passed by the **British** Legislature some twelve months ago.

* It appears to me that the action of these women, wrongly directed, is at the bottom of the **British** legislation referred to, and that there is some justification for it.

* 5th February of that year, appears a copy of a report, drawn up by the **British** Commercial Agent of the United States, uponthe boot and shoe industry of that country.

* The report calls the very particular attention of **British** manufacturers to the fact, as evidenced by the statistics, that the exportation of boots and shoes from the United States is increasing at a rapid rate.

* The importations from the United States into **British** Australasia in 1898 aggregated a value of 67,000, whilst in 1900 they had increased to 278,000.

* He blames the **British** Government for the Anglophobia which exists on the continent, contending that it is the unpopularity of the Government which has given rise to that feeling.

* There is a difference of opinion even in the old country on this question, and if any part of the **British** Empire calls a public meeting to approve of the policy and the  modus operandi  of the war, and allows the military to attend, that is a breach of **British** liberty, and an attempt to intimidate people into saying what the majority are saying.

* It is proposed that no contract shall be entered into with any company employing any but **British** white subjects on the ships used for carrying mails.

* It is perfectly well known by those who read current literature, that it is with the greatest possible difficulty that the **British** mercantile marine can be manned at the present time, and it is equally well known that half the men employed are not **British** subjects, but are to a very large extent Scandinavians, who are perhaps the best sailors in the world.

* This amendment would exclude from the ships carrying our mails all Europeans other than white **British** subjects ; but there is no doubt that the motion is aimed mainly at coloured labour.

* In my view, the words "white **British** subjects" constitute one of the best features of the amendment.

* I quite agree that Scandinavians and Germans and other foreigners do very good service as seamen, but as these mail steamers are specially subsidized with Commonwealth money, I think that we have a perfect right to say that our revenue shall be spent in trying to build up the **British** Navy as far as possible by affording employment to **British** seamen.

* It is of the very first importance that for such work they shall be manned by **British** subjects, and whatever other reasons there may be in favour of this amendment, that to me is a strong one.

* Let us havethe nucleus of the **British** Navy in the mercantile marine, or at all events in that portion of it which carries the mails.

* A few months ago I attended a great banquet in London in connexion with the Congress of Chambers of Commerce throughout the **British** Empire.

* I believe in England and in the **British** Empire ; and I sincerely hope that this Federal Parliament will not only strive to advance the wellbeing of Australia, but to conserve the interests of the **British** Empire.

* Has the Prime Minister received any official information in regard to the Russian attack upon the **British** fishing fleet in the North Sea, which is reported in this morning's newspapers?

* Postponed clause 14 (Arrangements may be made for **British** or foreign mails).

* With regard to the amendment of the honorable member for Flinders, whether we have a navy of our own or depend' on the **British** Navy it is our duty to have land forces in order to be able to give a fitting reception to any force that escaped the navy and sought to land on our shores.

* I communicated with the **British** Consul in America, and also sought information in Canada with respect to the cost of these machines, and I received from the Canadian Government a reply that the Minister had decided not to afford any information regarding the values and manufacture of machinery of this kind intended for export.

* A short time ago I received an intimation from the **British** Consul at Chicago that when a certain train arrived in that city from Montreal the trucks were opened and Chicago machines were placed in them.

* Some of them were sent to New Zealand, and others to Brisbane, but beforethe communication from the **British** Consul arrived they had been distributed, and nothing could be done.

* So f ar as the clause relating to **British** seamen is concerned, I should not object to its being eliminated altogether.

* It is very often found that a **British** officer who may have a good deal of affectation in his manner will prove himself in time of war to be a most efficient soldier.

* The Executive may put this amending Bill into the hands of the Governor-General before he gets the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Bill, and he will then be in the position of assenting to a Bill amending a, law which is not in force.

* We have been informed that this tax has now been imposed, and I say it is to the eternal disgrace of the **British** administration in South Africa that they should seek to compel the natives against their will to enter the mines to work under the mine-owners' conditions.

* If it was the Boer policy, more shame to the **British** Government to countenance the continuance of it.

* I have been assured on the one hand' that if we carry the proposal of the Treasurer it means the ' complete obliteration of the **British** Imperial Oil Company, and also of the local company.

* An infant not being a natural-born **British** subject 
Whose mother is married to a natural-born **British** subject or to a person who has obtained a certificate of naturalization ; and who has at any time resided in Australia with such father or mother, shall in the Commonwealth be naturalized and have the same rights and privileges and be subject to the same obligations as a person who has obtained a certificate of naturalization.

* The result of that law was that, until 1870, England would admit no **British** subject to divest himself of his nationality.

* I say that it is contrary to all ideas of **British** justice that a man should be condemned and punished before his guilt has been established.

* To whatever party a member may belong, I take it that there is inherent in each of us a feeling of reverence for the principle of justice and fair play underlying the **British** maxim that a man shall be deemed innocent until he has been .proved guilty.

* If the New Zealand agreement had been framed more on the lines of the agreement under discussion, it would have had a better chance of being adopted, and would have been more in keeping with the general principle which should underlie **British** Imperial preferences.

* Without waiting for bargaining, each country should determine what its Tariff should be, having regard to the necessities, and economic and political opinions of its people, offering a reduction of possibly 25 per cent, to Great Britain and **British** dependencies.

* I hope that it will tend to the development of the Sou!h African Confederation in such a way that we shall be able to hold that country as a **British** dependency, that it will give us a larger market for our surplus produce, fruit, and timber, and that the-e will be a great increase in our trade with the sister dependency.

* To those who are strong on Empire questions - and that seems to be the position to-night - I would say this : that it is not wise to encourage the employment of lascars inasmuch as that Great Britain experiences great trouble manning the fleet with **British** seamen, and still greater difficulty in obtaining **British** firemen.

* Those **British** Ministers who Have been most hated by foreign countries have always been the most powerful in the old country.

* Assuming that100 represents the whole trade of Great Britain, she imports from foreign countries 80 per cent., from **British** India 7 per cent., from Australasia 7 per cent., from Canada 4 per cent., from **British** South Africa  1  per cent., and from other **British** possessions  1  per cent.

* The exports from Great Britain to **British** India represent 14 per cent., to Australasia 9 per cent., and to Canada 3 per cent.

* Notwithstanding the adverse conditions in Australia, and the better conditions in Canada, the exports from Great Britain to Australasia represent 9 per cent., to Canada only 3 per cent, to **British** South' Africa 6 per cent., and to other **British** possessions 4 per cent.

* If we are to have fiscal federation that must imply a sacrifice of the interests of the **British** consumer.

* For instance, locomotives are, if anything, one of the main products of **British** industries.

* It is a clause that has found a place, in most of the copyright legislation in **British** communities, and is one that has .been supported by **British** legislation for the promotion and.

* I support the principle of the clause very heartily, knowing its value in the interests of literature - Australian literature perhaps, **British** literature, and the world's literature.

* If those who represented the people of Australia in the framing of the compact laid down in it an imperative duty, and the people by accepting it on more than one occasion confirmed that duty, and if while the Bill was under the consideration of the Imperial Parliament - during which time the fiercest light of criticism, both **British** and Australian, was concentrated upon these very judicial provisions - there was no hint of an alteration in the construction of the High Court, or of its abolition, or of the substitution for it of some other tribunal, a very great responsibility will rest upon those who advise us at this juncture to ignore so.

* That section provides that - 
Under that Act the Privy Council may pass an order or may give a right of appeal from any court in the **British** dominions, with the exception of those in the **British** Isles.

* But there was in clause 74, as it was sent home, a provision that there should be no appeal at all - I take that to mean from the High Court or from the States courts - to the Privy Council on what were called constitutional matters, that is, matters relating to the interpretation of the Federal Constitution or of any State Constitution, except decisions affecting, speaking shortly, the public interests of any other part of the **British** dominions.

* There are also retired Judges from India, from the West Indies, and from other parts of the **British** dominions, who have served their time faithfully and well, and who are now - at all events, members of the Privy Council.

* There are men on the Privy Council, who, for some reason or other, have not been elevated to the House of Lords, and who, while they are not allowed by law to become members of the ultimate Court of Appeal for the inhabitants of the **British** Isles, are considered quite good enough to give final judgments upon matters affecting the subjects in **British** dominions abroad.

* Even if we desired to present a petition to  His  Majesty there should be no necessity for us to say that the " sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland."

* The Governments at Home, who have practically controlled the administration of **British** affairs during the past twenty years, have not been able to go so far as the Home Rulers desire, although many Acts, I am glad to say, have been introduced for improving and ameliorating the condition of the Irish people.

* But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand, or effectually deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland.

* Nothing could be imagined more repugnant to the spirit of **British** liberty and toleration than to permit any kind of labour organization to use a Court of law as the instrument for offering to those who differ from it the alternative of joining or being dismissed.

* He is now in the Old Country, where, if the **British** Army authorities are wise, they will keep him; but I hope that he will come back brimful of information.

* I am quite prepared to admit that, as far as outside defence, and the protection of our commerce is concerned, we ought to be prepared to make some contribution towards the maintenance of something like an efficient **British** fleet.

* I merely desire to point out that twelve months ago he favoured a direct contribution to the **British** Navy, and declared that the maintenance of an Australian fleet would be altogether too expensive an undertaking for us.

* Others have affirmed that they must be loyal and patriotic to Australia- 
**British** authorities applied for Australian troops.

* But that is not the kind of Imperialism which the **British** Government or the people of Great Britain desire to exercise ; and he will be a fortunate and powerful public man who can find the true phrase to describe the position.

* The only phrase that occurs to rae as sufficiently expressive of the unity of the **British** race is that of " **British**  dominionism."

* The Downing-street of to-day does not represent either conservative or liberal politicians, who look upon the colonies as burdens, but represents a public opinion much more enlightened than that which prevailed in the past, and one which demands more and more attention to the development of the **British** dependencies.

* While we contribute this money to the support of the **British** Navy there is not the slightest necessity to neglect our local naval defence by means of naval brigades or naval reserves.

* Downing-street today is sufficiently well advised not to treat, or attempt to treat, Australia, or any other portion of the **British** Empire, in the contemptuous manner in which it did 30 or 40 years ago.

* I wish to knowif the Government favours the introduction of Indians into Australia, and whether the **British** Government has the right to resume the Northern Territory ?

* And he went on to say, in the same interview, that he did not think that the contract between the **British** Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company contained any such provision.

* Sub- sidies were paid to provide swift armoured cruisers in time of war, to maintain the supremacy of **British** commerce, as well as for the carriage of mails.

* It seems that the German companies are determined to cut into the trade of Australia as well as that of other places, and' if the subsidy which the German boats now receive, is not sufficient to enable them to compete for this trade with **British** boats there can be no doubt that larger subsidies will be granted to them.

* It seems to me that the question of speed is so important that in order to bring the different parts of the Empire into communication, and in order to give the **British** Government a sufficient command of swift steamers, we ought to look into the question, for instance, of increasing the speed of our communication with South Africa.

* I think it is worth the while of the country to stipulate with the shipowners that there should be a large proportion of **British** seamen, and if that puts the ship-owner to more expense, then that is a question of compensating the ship-owner again.

* Your final suggestion was, was it not, and I understood it to be only a last resort in case matters became" very desperate, that the Government should be prepared to run lines of their own from **British** Possessions, at all events?

* Would not the merchant to whom goods were sent by **British** ships in that case have an opportunity of raising the price to the consumer to the amount of the value of the article, plus the duty that we paid on all the foreign imports?

* The Peninsular and Oriental Company have a total income of 3,000,000 per annum, including' the 337,000 they receive by1 way of subsidy from the **British** Government.

* F'rom the stand-point of defence, it is very important that only **British** sailors should be trained in our mercantile marine.

* **British** sailors.

* He declared that if war were to break out to-morrow, and it became necessary to withdraw from the mercantile marine of Great Britain the sailors who were associated with the Naval Reserve, the **British** mercantile fleet would be absolutely manned by foreigners.

* that a Ministry, coming face to face with this Parliament in connexion with a matter of great national importance, should not havegiven themselves away to a **British** Minister before the discussion began.

* How about **British** subjects' ?

* **British** subjects are dealt with in many places as coloured labour.

* It is impossible to deal with Britishsubjects on the same footing as you deal with other coloured people- 
That is to say that the alien coloured labour would be shut out absolutely, and that the educational dodge would shutout coloured **British** subjects.'

* He goes on to say - 
It is only a question of the assent by the King to legislation dealing with **British** subjects.

* I assert that it shocked the conscience of the **British** Empire that a man who came out under perfectly honorable conditions, with his trade union introduction in his pocket- 
No question to be submitted to the Navigation Conference which is to be held in London next vear will claim closer attention than that of the manning of **British** ships.

* It was made very manifest to the Commonwealth Navigation Commission that the number of **British** subjects engaged upon these ships is rapidly declining, and, in my opinion, the time is not far distant when legislation will have to be enacted with a view to encouraging their employment.

* The **British** people will say, " Thank you for nothing.

* Like the previous speaker, I fail to see that the adoption of this proposal would be in the best interests of the natives of **British** New 
In reply to your query about the working of liquor laws in **British** New Guinea, I refer you to a minute passed by a Committee of our Mission in March last, and forwarded to the Commonwealth Government through our agent, the Rev.

* There are only two doctors in the whole of **British** New Guinea.

* **British** New Guinea has a coast-' line (on the mainland) of 1,700 miles, and islands representing a littoral of 1,900 miles more, or 3,600 miles in all.

* But is it not rather curious that a few days ago, when we were discussing a proposal to grant exclusive representation on the Council of **British** New Guinea to the white residents of that Possession, many of these honorable members, including the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, supported the amendment designed to carry out that project?

* It is solely because these islands are out of control of the administration of **British** New Guinea that the natives are able to obtain supplies there.

* I hope that the Government will do their best to make some arrangements with the State to so alter its boundary as to enable the authorities in **British** :New Guinea to exercise control over the adjacent islands.

* If representations be made that the present frontier is not designed in the best interests of the native races of **British** New Guinea.

* 7334  Papua (**British**  [REPRESENTATIVES.

* The Church of England Bishop of **British** New Guinea.

* When not protected by the laws already in force in **British** New Guinea he will  takeit.

* In those parts of **British** New Guinea where the authorities have absolute control over the traffic, the natives do not obtain liquor; and if the Government succeed in securing an alteration of the Queensland frontier in the direction I have indicated, I think we shall do all that we are called upon to do at present in the interests of the native races of the Territory.

* I am absolutely against the proposal in the contract, and would substitute for it the provision contained in the **British** contracts, which the Ministry have sought to make it appear - probably without knowledge - is similar to the provision in this contract.

* The Prime Minister said that the Postmaster-General read from a **British** contract a provision similar to that in the present proposal.

* After that clear statement of the position by honorable members, the Ministry cannot get out of this position, either they thought thev were doing the same thing as the **British** Government, or they are acting on the principle advocated by honorable members in the corner, who have openly avowed that they support the proposal of the Government because it is 
The Ministry would hope to get the money from the **British** lender, I suppose.

* The Government profess to wish to copy the **British** contract.

* The **British** public service has adopted the principle of State annuities, which I believe in much more firmly than I do in the payment of a lump sum.

* The poorer classes of' the community have to pay the heavy impost, because the chairs affected are not made in Japan or China, but are Austrian, **British**, and American, and made from a class of wood which cannot be obtained here.

* It carries on a wholesale and retail storekeeping business in the islands, and the Government propose to subsidize a monopoly, which we have no right to support, in order that it may enter into competition with a German company for the trade of the Marshall Islands, which are beyond the sphere of **British** influence.

* I have no objection to giving the company every facility to trade freely within the **British** sphere of influence, but, seeing the resentment which has been shown by the Germans to our invasion of their trade, I think we shall be taking great risks, and may have to pay dearly in the future for our temerity, if we continue this subsidy.

* I am informed that there is now a vessel trading between the mainland and **British** and German New Guinea, which is in every respect superior to that employed by Burns, Philp, and Company in the New Guinea service, being a vessel of 160 tons, whereas the company's vessel is only 106 tons.

* Are commercial relations between two of the most important divisions of the **British** family forever to remain dormant in order that the profits of a company may be maintained?

* Are the vital interests of the **British** Empire to be neglected ?

* It was time for 'the **British** people scattered round the world to set about putting their house in order.

* If not, why did three of the States contract with the Canadian and **British** Governments with reference to the establishment of the Pacific cable in order to break down a monopoly?

* Every time that the democrats of Australia attempt to do something to put the white man on a level of equality with the gentleman ' of colour, a wire comes from across the continent, saying - "You must not interfere with the **British** subject."

* I suppose that if 50 or 60 of these coloured gentlemen were to knock a man down- and kick him, the answer would be - " you must not interfere, because they are **British** subjects."

* The treaties into which Great Britain has entered with the Eastern nations provide that, as far as the **British** dominions are concerned, they shall in their powers of legislation be free from the operation of the treaties.

* We ought to be content to rely, as we have done in the past, upon the spirit of the **British** people themselves.

* The position is a sorrowful one, not only for to-day, because in other problems which will arise the effect will be felt when we are again compelled to approach the **British** authorities.

* How is it that they have ruined the growers of cane-sugar  in some of the **British** possessions ?

* We know that not long ago the **British** Government were considering the condition of the sugar-growers in **British** possessions, and their being brought into competition with the growers of bounty-fed sugar.

* A great many honorable members of this House, and of all Parliaments throughout the **British** dominions, are fortunately engaged in trade or have private business to attend to, which necessitates their devoting two or three days a week to their private callings.

* A certain amount of time must be given by honorable members to their private business, and we do not desire that the Victorian State Parliament, the Federal Parliament, or any other Parliament in the **British** dominions, should be ruled entirely by professional politicians.

* The Legislature of **British** Columbia passed an Act enabling the Corporation of Vancouver to make by-laws for regulating, with a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease, the entry and departure of ships at the port of Vancouver, and the landing of passengers and cargoes from ships or from railroad cars.

* I think that the Prime Minister can now appeal to the **British**, authorities with confidence knowing that he has the States at his back, and that all the members of this Legislature are also behind him.

* It is evident, from the statement accompanying the Bill, that the Minister has followed the latest **British** legislation on marine insurance, and in doing so he has been quite justified.

* It is highly desirable that our marine insurance law should accord with that of Great Britain, especially in view of the modernness of the **British** law, because Great Britain is the heart of the insurance business, not merely of the Empire, but of the world.

* The value has to be substantiated, and if we were to allow substantiation to be done away with, we should offer a premium for fraud 
I desire to know from the Prime Minister when the report of the Secretary for External Affairs, relating to **British** New Guinea, will be presented to the House?

* In Victorian Acts references are given to the exact year of the **British** Acts cited, so that we know exactly where to look for the original legislation.

* I suggest that the word " **British** " should be used in the marginal notes where the reference is to a **British** Act, just as the word " Canada " is used before the word " Act " in the reference in the marginal note to clause 15.

* Would it not be better for Australia, and particularly for our producers, if Ministers made our wishes known to the **British** Government ?

* He is a Hanoverian by birth, but under the laws of the land of his nativity he has ceased to be a Hanoverian subject, and he is not a **British** subject.

* He is eighty years of age, and was in receipt of an old-age pension for two years, but immediately it was found ihat he was not a **British** subject the pension was taken from him, and he has been left to starve.

* Our contribution towards the expense incurred in that way by Great Britain has been ^200,000 per annum, but for all practical purposes that6 defence has been provided by **British** money, **British** ships, and **British** sailors.

* It is true that quite a number of young Australians have been trained on **British** vessels during the last few years, and that, according to Admiral Fawkes, and the present Admiral on the Australian station, they have acquitted themselves exceedingly well ; but for all practical purposes we may say that the sea defence of Australia has been pro0vided by **British** men, ships, and money.

* I understood that whilst advocating the naval and military defence of Australia by Australians, and defraying the cost of that defence out of Australian money, we were going to ask the people to contribute the funds necessary for it ; but the Treasurer, in the course of his speech, read the following statement : - 
We are acting in complete sympathy and accord with the Imperial Admiralty, and with the people of the other self-governing Dominions of the Empire ; and, above all, we are showing to the world that the **British** Dominions beyond the sea are determined, without any pressure, but of our own free will, in a time of peace and prosperity, to make provision so that, should the day of adversity unhappily come upon us, we shall be in a position to stand shoulder by shoulder with our kinsmen of the Old Land.

* As this man has **British** blood through his father and grandfather, I desire to ask the Minister that he may be permitted to stay in the Commonwealth.

* I cannot, on the spur of the moment; say what precedent there is in the action of the authorities of any other **British** community for what has been done; but the terms of section 13 of the Papua Act may assist the right honorable member in coming to a conclusion as to the constitutionality of what has been done in this case.

* I have it on the authority of the Minister of External Affairs that a great number are applying for naturalization now ; and I should say that by the end of the year all those who are qualified and desire pensions will, if not already **British** subjects, avail themselves of the provisions of the Bill.

* mother country, come forward with that old traditional policy of building up a tariff wall against the mother country, and at the same time assure the people that the only distressed persons in the world for whom they had an affectionate interest and anxiety we're the **British** manufacturers ?

* It is quite novel that the appeal of the **British** manufacturers for consideration, for the relaxation of this policy of protection, should have received so much, I will not say practical, but rhetorical sympathy from the Prime Minister, and the position would have been indescribably absurd if the protectionist flag of isolation and war against the mother country had been displayed side by side with a new loyal emblem of Imperial devotion.

* But under the flag of protection  Mr. Deakin  as the friend of the mother country, and  Mr. Reid  as the enemy of the mother country, would have been too ridiculous; because  Mr. Reid's  whole political existence has been devoted to removing tariff barriers from the path of the mother country, and  Mr. Reid  happened to be the only man in the **British** Empire who, with the aid of his loyal friends, was able to pass a tariff policy which outrivalled  in breadth and liberality even the **British** Tariff itself.

* Perhaps it is as well that at the outset we should obtain a supply of new coins from the **British** mints, but after having obtained the 2,000,000 worth of silver coinage, as well as the bronze coinage required for circulation in the Commonwealth, we could afterwards supply our own increasing requirements.

* It is rather a weakness to make it apply to **British** white sailors only.

* I have repeatedly read articles in the English magazines and reviews affirming that the idea of limiting the employment of sailors in our mercantile marine to **British** seamen is fast gaining ground in the mother country.

* I regret that the honorable member for W est Sydney has thought fit to make his amendment go so far as to provide that this white labour shall be limited to **British** seamen.

* I think it is a retrograde movement for the **British** race to attempt to exclude other European nations.

* The case of  Mr. Craig  has been brought forward on more than one occasion in this Chamber and in another place, and I think that in the interests of the Commonwealth and of **British** New Guinea an inquiry should be made into the charges which  Mr. Craig  has preferred.

* When they undertake the responsibilities of Commonwealth citizenship they become entitled to the rights enjoyed by natural-born **British** subjects.

* A woman who, not being a **British** subject, marries a **British** subject, shall in the Commonwealth be naturalized, and have the same rights and privileges, and be subject to the same obligations, as a person who has obtained a certificate of naturalization.

* Some time ago the **British** Government found it necessary to appoint a Commission to inquire into the arrangements which were made by the War Office in connexion with the South African campaign.

* That Commission has recently presented a report which reveals a startling state of affairs, and the **British** Government will find it necessary to take prompt action to effect reforms.

* The **British** Commission on the conduct of affairs in South Africa will do for the land forces what Lord Charles Beresford and other reformers have done for the **British** Navy.

* At the Conference which was held upon the subject of the control of **British** New Guinea at the beginning of 1883, and at which, it will be remembered, resolutions were adopted which led to theformal constitution of the Federal Council of Australia - a3 honorable members who choose to look up its proceedings and to read the papers placed before it will see - the position was clearly put before the **British** Government of the day.

* The result of annexation in the case - of **British** New Guinea has been already to lay upon us a "burden of 20,000 a year.

* If the **British** Government, for instance, went so far as to saddle the Imperial funds with the acquisition of any greater portion of New Guinea than is already possessed by the Empire, the responsibility, and the responsibility for all time, of managing and paying for the management of the land so acquired would no doubt fall upon the Commonwealth, especially if such steps were taken at our instance.

* The Honorary Minister, who represented the' Go- vernment at the Imperial Defence Conference, says that offers of the resources of the Commonwealth to the **British** Government ale empty unless we can do something effective.

* The **British** Fleet will protect us on the high seas, and we shall be ready to give a hot time to any enemy landing on Australian soil.

* It has been said in the past by certain people that there is no need for us to defend ourselves, because the **British** Navy will defend us.

* Our real defence, apart from the **British** Fleet, must ever remain in the strength of well-trained land forces.

* think it interesting to hear a few of the facts bearing on the question : Under an
              agreement, the result of the Imperial Conference of 1887, the administration of
              **British** New Guinea was intrusted to the Government of Queensland, with the condition
              that, in matters beyond ordinary matters of administration, the States of Victoria and
              New South Wales, which also were contributories towards the cost, should be consulted.

* Le  Hunt, when I was last in Sydney,
              and from the facts I gathered then, and the papers which have been transmitted to me,
              I am of opinion that there will be considerable difficulty with regard to the
              administration of **British** New Guinea, unless the Commonwealth shortly takes the matter
              in hand.

* The main question of
              policy for this Parliament to decide will be, whether it is right to cause to be
              handed over to us, if- possible, the administration of **British** territory in New
              Guinea.

* the control of the Solomon Islands so far as they are in **British** hands,
              either as an adjunct to New Guinea and part of the same territory, or as another
              territory ' of the Commonwealth.

* But most of the companies that are creating this clamour are **British**-owned, having their head offices in London, the directors being probably interested in other enterprises and inclined to give a preference to **British** productions.

* At the present time the Orient Company have only one vessel on this coast manned by lascars, but their intention, as shown in the reply to a question put to the Postmaster-General in the **British** House of Commons, is, unless something extraordinary occurs, to increase the proportion of lascars employed on their steamers.

* All the other **British** over sea lines, except the mail steamers, are manned by white men, a very large proportion of whom are **British** subjects.

* I would like the clause postponed so that we may see whether it would not be possible, in addition to insisting on white labour, to require that a certain prpportion of the men employed should be **British** subjects.

* Although we have determined to give a preference to **British** goods brought here in **British** ships, we should allow time to importers to direct that their goods shall be sent by **British** ships.

* per dozen on **British** wool hats means 150 or 200 per cent.

* The honorable member for Wentworth said that this restriction would be detrimental to the **British** Navy; but I hold that one of the best ways to build up the navy would, be to provide that only **British** white subjects should form the crews on moil boats which receive a. subsidy from the Commonwealth.

* In regard to **British** subjects, I hope the honorable member for West Sydney will stick to his amendment ; and I believe that so far as the **British** Government is concerned, the measure will be passed in that form probably more easily than in any other form.

* I wish to know if he has made inquiries, and has come to the promised decision, as to whether the preference given to **British** manufacturers is that approved by this House, and approved, for the most part by Ministers?

* Whilst I am in favour of this proposed appropriation as an earnest of our intention to provide for the defence of our coast, I certainly am not in favour of our withdrawing from the Naval Agreement under which we contribute , 200,000 per annumto the up keep of the **British** Navy.

* The **British** Navy is the chief arm of our defence.

* But even if the vessels of a hostile force succeeded in raiding us, it is questionable whether they would be able to get away with the spoil, because the **British** Fleet, having command of the sea, would probably .

* The Admiral of the **British** Fleet should have full control over the vessels provided by Australia.

* In the case of woollens and similar goods, we find that Great Britain already supplies us with 75 per cent., and the purchase of the balance of 25 per cent, from foreigners or locally only keeps the **British** merchants in check.

* I am not such a believer in the **British** merchant as to think he would not avail himself of the opportunity' to get a higher price if he had the chance.

* Honorable members opposite have expressed grave fears that -**British** trade is depreciating ; but, according to page 383 of the report of the Imperial Conference,  Mr. Lloyd  George laughed at such fears, and pointed out that the increase in the cotton trade alone, in four years, represented 20,000,000, or more than the whole of the trade with Australia.

* The Imperial authorities will not accept pur offer of preference ; thev are evidently not afraid that **British** trade is going down too fast.

* When the **British** postal authorities submitted a proposal to the late Government to adopt penny postage from England if the domestic rate ruled between here and the old country, I felt justified in recommending my colleagues to adopt the Empire rate of 2d.

* - that is, to apply the rate at present in force in Australia to all **British** mails.

* Because we agreed to do that, the **British** Government consented to bring penny postage into operation as between the old .country and Australia.

* rate would mean a loss of about ,7,000 per annum, assuming that it did not lead to any increase in the volume of correspondence, and the Department considered that it would be well justified in incurring that loss for the sake of inducing the **British** Government to adopt penny postage in respect to letters sent from England to Australia.

* Once we have secured the position of Australia, I shall be prepared, even without reciprocal treatment, to grant a preference to **British** imports.

* The Government are seeing and will see that the law is applied equally to **British** and foreign ships.

* The only complaint I know of is that the foreign ship referred to was treated more harshly than was the **British** ship ; but that is not a fact.

* It is the intention of the Federal Government to strictly enforce the provisions of the Customs Act against **British** and foreign ships alike.

* Unfortunately, foreign nations far removed from these islands - nations whose interests are not nearly so directly centred in them as are those of the **British** - have already established themselves there.

* It is true that our relations with those powers have been of a friendly character, but I understand that there has been considerable friction locally between the **British** residents, who have borne the heat and burden of developing these islands, and their foreign neighbours.

* I consider that the **British** people have a special claim to recognition in connexion with the occupancy and the development of the trade and commerce of these islands.

* The influence of the latter is growing, and is practically menacing **British** occupation.

* That is contrary to the principles of **British** law.

* I am not aware of a law in any **British** community that compels a man to give evidence rendering him liable to a criminal prosecution, so long as he objects to do so, and his plea is a  bondfide  one.

* The amendments in the Papua **British** New Guinea Bill were to have been printed and circulated to-night, but as that is not now possible, I dp not propose to proceed with the measure until Tuesday next.

* If honorable members will look at the files of the  Times  they will see that  Mr. Balfour  stated that he favoured preference to the Colonies, because it would have the effect - and I am using almost his identical words - of discouraging the growth and development of vested interests in Colonial industries, and of thus leading to a greater consumption of **British** goods.

* Mr. Balfour,  however, stated that one of the advantages, if not the object of the scheme, was to stop the development of Colonial industries and lead to a greater consumption of **British** goods.

* I think I see clearly that if the **British** Empire had protection against the outside world, the menace to other nations would be so great that we could dictate our own terms.

* that it is precisely of the class of Bills which have been allowed in the past, and that as we have been led to understand the **British** Government will not take exception to such Bills, we are content to abide by their decision that they will not be embarrassed.

* When honorable members talk so roundly - and surely everybody has the right to talk roundly - of the position they mean to take up in wresting assent from the **British** Government - which, by some sort of implication, is said to be a hectoring or selfish n Government, instead of one which extends uniform protection over all parts of the Empire- by declarations of the kind proposed, let us consider the position for a minute.

* Of course, we have no wish to leave the Empire ; but if we imperil our relation with the Empire, or create friction which may ultimately lead to severance, let it be remembered that it is under the protection of the **British** fleet that we make our proposals - under the protection of the first line of defence, which all can assume as an everyday right of their own, forgetful that it is nearly all paid for by the taxpayers of Great Britain and Ireland.

* We find that there is no provision made for according the preference just as it is required by the decline of **British** imports in proportion to foreign imports.

* In the case of the item under consideration, we find that the proportion of **British** imports to foreign imports was greater in 1905 than in 1903.

* In other words, there is not the same necessity for granting a preference to **British** imports in this case as there was in the case of the item which the Minister has agreed to reconsider.

* If the ratio of increase in imports is maintained, then in the course of a few years **British** dynamite, &amp;c, will command practically the whole market here.

* AtPort Darwin we have a harbor with a rise and fall of 26 feet high-tide springs, a harborsome- 6 miles in length by 4 miles in width, capable of sheltering the whole **British** fleet, and manoeu vring, them, too, without the slightest fear of a collision.

* When heasserts that we must not interfere with individual liberty, and supports war rather than peace, he surely forgets that, so far asthe **British** race is concerned, war has always been their last resort, and that, when it hasbeen entered upon, their desire has been to bring it to as speedy a termination as possible.

* I clearly set forth that I believed the proper attitude for this Commonwealth was to tell the **British** Government what we mean ; and I also said I believed the **British** Government would see a way out of the peculiar difficulties surrounding the subject.

* I then drew a picture of the difficulties which might arise in the Government of the **British** Empire, partly made up of the colonies and partly made up of great Imperial interests in connexion with India and her spheres of influence, and I simply said - it was purely a hypothetical idea - that if in the future in any of those difficulties, emanating from the Government of the Empire itself, it was found impossible to reconcile the demands of the colonies with the aspirations of the colonies, then I, for one, if I had on the one hand a picture of Australia in the same condition as the United States of America, and it was necessary to choose - if that was the only condition under which we could remain part of the **British** Empire - I would know what course to choose.

* This is a form of machinery similar to that adopted in dealing with territories of aii kinds in the **British** Empire.

* They will not be able to fly the flag of "Australia for the Australians " so far as the **British**' Empire is concerned.

* If we are not prepared to trade with the **British** Empire and with other nations, they will not wish to trade with us, and, under such circumstances, we might just as well discontinue the running of our mail steamers, abolish our cable services, and live isolated from the rest of the world.

* I. consider that Ministerial supporters are thoroughly loya) to the **British** throne, but, at the same time, they are not loyal to **British** trade and commerce.

* It is not a question of what the representative of the **British** Government proposes to do, we desire to know whether it is not possible to induce that Government to fall into linewith the views of our Government, which, I hope, will represent the public opinion of this country.

* To ask the **British** Government what it will accept?

* - The honorable member seems to forget that the Conference is meeting to discuss, not offers of  Dreadnoughts,  but the future defence of the **British** Empire.

* Has the Honorary Minister been instructed to say that we are willing to largely increase the naval subsidy and give up building destroyers, or will he say that we shall continue to present  Dreadnoughts  whenever they are demanded by the **British** Government?

* At any point around Cockatoo Island, the largest **British** warships could float, and the docks there are sufficient to accommodate the largest vessels of the kind likely to come to Australia.

* I see no distinction between the greed of the **British** capitalist and the American capitalist.

* We cannot do better than adopt the method which has been pursued all over the **British** Dominions and in the United States.

* I am rather sorry that he should have constituted himself the latest champion of the party which he joins in denominating " the stinking fish party," the party which is always prepared to repudiate the possibility of anything good coming out of Australia - the party which has attempted to blacken the good name of this community, and to hold us up before the world as a people who would shut out **British** subjects from cur shores, and as having actually refused to allow drowning men to land'.

* That it is desirable that the attention of the Governments of the Colonies and the United Kingdom should be called to the present state of the navigation laws in the Empire, and in other countries, and to the advisability of refusing the privileges of coastwise trade, including trade between, the Mother Country and its Colonies and Possessions, and between one Colony or Possession and another, to countries in which the corresponding trade is confined to ships of their own nationality ; and also to the laws affecting shipping, with a view of seeing whether any other steps should be taken to promote Imperial trade in **British** vessels.

* Honorable members will - recall to mind the coal export duties that were passed by the **British** Government to provide funds for special purposes.

* No doubt the representatives of Western Australia are also anxious that the Transcontinental Railway Survey Bill should be dealt with this session, and I am confident that the honorable member for Cowper desires that the **British** New Guinea Bill should likewise be passed.

* If ever it were necessary to have the assistance of the **British** Fleet, it is necessary now; and the assistance is becoming more imperative in view of the fact that the theatre of international complication, and of naval trouble, must be in the Pacific.

* With regard to what has been said as to what we want, I think there is a great tendency for us to lean upon **British** officers, who come here with all their **British** traditions and **British** ideas as to defence and drill.

* In that introduction, which is most interesting to me, particularly as coming from a man who has had recent experience in a very difficult class of warfare, one who has read the German and French works on military matters, and who has at the same time a strong **British** and professional spirit, he says this with regard to the lessons which the war has taught : - 
That may be, but I am sure that the existence of this provision will  not  help them.

* It has occurred to me that the independent orbits in which the great communities assembled under the **British** Crown revolve, whilst perhaps remote one from the other, all work harmoniously in the great scheme of the **British** Empire, and those who wish to.bring these mighty forces into closer relationship might easily find that discord, instead of peace, might be created, and that instead of mutual self-respect and self-restraint the less amiable forces of political life might be let loose upon the Imperial tie.

* There is another project less ambitious than that - and more tempting - which seeks to federate the **British** Empire, at any rate, in matters of trade.

* That project is one which should always be seriously considered ; but again I have to say that neither  h-om  the point of view of the **British** nor of the colonial people have I yet seen the outline of a scheme which could be seriously discussed.

* There is a still more practicable and more attractive proposal, upon which the Prime Minister has pronounced himself favorably, namely, that the self-governing colonies should in their scheme of customs duties differentiate between **British** and foreign products.

* This Act may be cited as the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Amendment Act 1906.

* The schedule to the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) 1906 is amended by omitting in the column headed "Duties" all the words in the first and second sub-headings after the words " United Kingdom.

* "- 
In the schedule, as it will then stand, it is provided that preference shall be given to the goods named which are the produce of the United Kingdom imported in **British** ships.

* The
            principle is also - introduced that all the male inhabitants of' the Commonwealth
            who have been here fora period of six months, who are **British** subjects, and between the
            ages of 18 and 60, shall be subject to be called upon toperform military service.

* We ' ace a part and parcel of the
            **British** Empire, and our.

* W&gt;e may wish to have some say in the matter ; but wars are not made  by  us or by the **British** Empire for the mere sake of war.

* I find there that the **British** commerce in that yeal- totalled in value some.thing like
            970,000,000.

* As against that sura, the cost of the **British** navy which
            protects and maintains this commerce amounts to something like 20,000,000 per
            annum, of which these States contribute about 268,000.

* As an offshoot of the **British** nation, we consider ourselves to be an enlightened people, and, perhaps, more advanced in civilization than most other nations, but we shall not be able to fully sustain our claim in that regard unless we provide for our poor in their own homes, instead of requiring them to seek a refuge in charitable institutions.

* I do not go the whole length with some of my friends in reference to prohibiting the introduction of Chinamen, but after Australians and Canadians, and, in fact, the men of all the **British** dominions have shed their blood in the Transvaal in defence of the rights of **British** subjects, it is not right that Chinamen should be imported., fo perform work which should be given to our fellow white subjects.

* I trust, therefore, that our interference in what may be regarded in some .quarters as other' people's business will have  ;Some  effect, and that the importation of Chinamen into the Transvaal will not be persisted in, but that **British** subjects will be employed  in  recovering gold from the mines there.

* We are a part of the **British** Empire.

* Australians have nothing to fear, but we must be reasonable and admit by action as well as by word that Australia is not the whole of the **British** Empire.

* The history of the past two years has proved that the **British** Empire is federated, bound together by the bonds of love and affection.

* These are the bonds that bind, and so we find Lord Salisbury, in a speech addressed to the members of the **British** Empire League, counselling caution and careful consideration before the existing federation is put into a more concrete form.

* Years pass on, and a similar proposition is made, not by one of the **British** colonies in Northern America, but by the whole of those colonies combined as the Dominion of Canada.

* Those figures show that a large increase has taken place in the number of lascars and foreigners employed upon **British** ships, and a corresponding decrease in the number of Britishers so employed.

* During the past ten years I find that the lascars upon **British** ships have increased by 12,288, and the foreigners by 8,750, a total increase of 21,038 seamen, whereas the number of Britishers so employed has decreased by 7,155.

* The late Government conveyed the intimation to the **British** Government, and I may assume that  Colonel Foxton  has been informed that there is no alteration.

* A Convention has been held in London, at which an agreement - subject to approval upon this side of the world - was entered into between the French and **British** Governments.

* **British** settlers, upon the other hand, enjoy no such concessions from Australia or any other country.

* If the suggestions made by the late'  Mr. Seddon  and myself be granted, the future of the **British** settlers, as well as of the French, in the New Hebrides - but particularly that of the **British** settlers, who have been subjected to many disabilities -  will at last be placed on something like a permanent basis.

* We re cognise that the very existence of Australia, from the time of its birth, has been dependent upon the **British** Navy.

* We have, in the division of Papua, an illustration of what might have happened to Australia but for the **British** Navy.

* We know that the Island of New Guinea has been divided amongst three different nationalities, and but for the **British** Navy the same fate might have befallen this Continent.

* I am glad that the Prime Minister admits that it is because of the power of the **British** Navy that we have been able to hold, and still hold, the Northern Territory.

* I go further, however, and say that it is because of the power of that navy, and the fear of the **British** flag, that we are able to hold, and still hold, not merely the Northern Territory, but the whole of Australia.

* It deals with **British** expansion during the Victorian era, and the writer points out that, despite the fact that there was a large decrease in the population of Ireland, the population of the United Kingdom doubled itself during the reign of Queen Victoria.

* One has only to look at the men on board the vessels of the Auxiliary Squadron in Port Jackson, or those on the steamers trading between Australia and South Africa, and Australia and Vancouver, in order to gain an idea of the true type of **British** stoker.

* The incidents of the wreck served to show in a very marked way the difference between white and coloured seamen, and when I remember how well the **British** on the  Quetta  behaved, I feel proud to be a Britisher.

* How can any honorable member think of comparing our **British** white sailors with black men, and talk of **British** stokers as the " scum " of the earth?

* It would be well if some step were taken to make these islands a part of the **British** Empire, or at all events, to bring them more directly under **British** control ; but I do not think that the proposal to increase this mail subsidy is calculated to assist us in that direction.

* I believe that the .interests of the **British** people would be best served by our assuming control of them.

* If we succeed in establishing some reasonable system of governing **British** Papua we may feel disposed to accept some responsibility in regard to the New Hebrides.

* I have only to repeat that, while I am sure it is our desire to be at peace with the nations of the world, I think that we ought to secure these islands for the **British** people.

* I am afraid that we are embarked on a course of which this, and the other measures of a similar character that we have passed, rare the preliminaries, and which is altogether different from the standard that English Judges and **British** people, in consequence of the experience of the past, have set up.

* We are giving such unrestricted powers that, if they were used to their full extent and were not controlled by very high principles on the part of those exercising them, they would bring us back to the old Star Chamber system of **British** jurisprudence.

* It was the very excesses resulting from unrestricted powers being given to **British** Judges, that led the **British** people to adopt the principle - and a very sound principle I think it is - that every Briton should be deemed to be innocent until proved to be guilty.

* Has he been in communication with the **British** Government with a view to the visit of a **British** naval squadron under Admiral  Sir Percy  Scott, to Australia, and is he in a position to say whether an invitation to visit Australia is likely to be favorably considered by the **British** Government?

* Their aid and the hard work they underwent in maintaining order at Tien Tsin was beyond all praise, The Commander-in-Chief of the **British** Contingent,  Sir Alfred  Gazeley, said he could not speak too highly of the usefulness of the Colonial contingents.

* They had been, he said, an objectlesson, not only to their fellow Britishers, but to our Indian subjects, of the patriotism which inspiredall parts of the **British** Empire.

* Another authority is  Sir Peter  Scratchley, who, in 1876, reported that he considered that the Australian colonies were exposed to attacks from one or more cruisers - as a maximum, a squadron of four - which, eluding the **British** cruisers, might capture merchant ships in harbor, demand from Our capitals payment of many millions of money under threat of bombardment.

* I would next quote, a passage in a report submitted by the Colonial Defence Committee of Great Britain in March, 1901, in which it is stated that, although the Admiralty have accepted responsibility for protecting all **British** territory against foreign aggression, they may not always be in a position to prevent raids by hostile cruisers, their object being to destroy shipping or other accessible property of value in the **British** possessions in different parts of the globe.

* We do not desire to see the colonists hiring **British** ships at so much per ton per annum to guard their shores.

* It does not give our New Zealand and Australian fellow-countrymen the sense of personal interest, of personal possession, in the **British** navy which I most of all desiderate for the future.

* I should like to quote, not only these authorities, but the opinions of three **British** Admirals ' in support of the contention to which I now give prominence.

* Admiral Hopkins says - 
That is the testimony of a **British** Admiral, not of a faddist.

* He says in the  Spectator  of the 28th of March last - - 
Admiral Bowden Smith's suggestion for giving ' facilities for naval training to  a  certain number of Australians in a **British** cruiser is an excellent one, and entirely consistent  with  the spirit of our .

* My own opinion, in view of the preferential trade proposals we have recently had before us, is that a better form of assistance would be to give the products of the **British** settlers of the New Hebrides free entry into the markets of Australia.

* If the' Ministry will undertake to pass such an alteration of the Tariff as will permit of the free importation of produce grown by **British** settlers in the New Hebrides, l' shall make no further objection to the vote.

* I direct attention to the fact that **British** settlers in these islands are at a disadvantage when compared with their French rivals, because the Great Republic patriotically assists her subjects, and, while their produce is admitted free to the market of Noumea, a like concession is denied to the **British** settler.

* A despatch came from England stating that the **British** interpretation upon the convention of 1S60 was not only that the Chinese Government was to permit emigration to Australia, but that Australia was not to prevent Chinese from landing.

* In 1887 we were called to account by the **British** Government for our attempted breach, by the Chinese Restriction Acts, of the true obligations of the colonies.

* At one period we find the **British** Government encouraging the emigration of Chinese and seeking to fasten the obligation on the colonies to accept them.

* Now we are told that if we make any attempt to apply a strict colour policy the **British** Government will not assent to it.

* If our clear intention upon this matter is put before the **British** Government the better it will be for the Imperial Government and for Australia.

* We occupy these lands, not for ourselves alone, but for the great **British** people.

* One of the best ways in which we can show our loyalty to the Empire is to hold these lands for the **British** race, and to save them from contamination.

* If we allow the working classes of this country to be brought into unfair competition with Asiatic races, if we permit the morals qf the people and their stamina to be corrupted and depraved by the influx of these undesirable people, we shall indeed be proving recreant to the trust which the **British** Government have reposed in us.

* Under that Constitution, we are bound in honour and loyalty  to hold these lands for  the **British** race, and to save them from the contamination and degradation which must inevitably result from a wholesale influx of alien races.

* On the contrary we credit them with the most sincere desire to uphold the **British** character of our population.

* When we were in Committee upon another Bill, a little while ago, **British** methods were cited as a guide to us.

* Why, then, do not the Government tell us whether a similar provision to that advocated by the honorable member for Boothby is embodied ' in the Old-age Pensions Act which recently passed the **British** Parliament.

* **British** Empire had the same coinage, and that the **British** coinage was legal tender throughout the Empire.

* The last  speaker  said that we were going to reject a coin that is legal tender throughout the rest of the **British** Dominions.

* The question of a reciprocal arrangement to secure the circulation of our coin in Great Britain on the condition of the circulation of **British** coin here can be dealt with after the Bill is passed, if we include in this Bill the power to prevent **British** coin being legal tender in Australia.

* I have here a copy .of a letter from  Mr. John  E. Newton, the  Chairman  of the Council of the **British** Cotton Growers' Association, containing his report upon various samples submitted to him.

* Mr. Newton  says - 
**British** Cotton Growing Association.

* As I have already said, it cannot be rightly contended that in the proposal before the House we are recognising to the full our Imperial responsibilities, seeing that, as the Honorary Minister has pointed out, the **British** Government is to contribute towards the upkeep of the proposed fleet 250,000 a year, which will more than pay interest and the contribution to the sinking fund.

* In my opinion, our people, as Australians, and as members of the **British** Empire, are enthusiastic patriots, and quite ready to provide for a fleet at their own expense.

* According to my calculations, it will require  298,000  to provide interest and a sinking fund of  5  per cent., though that leaves the statement of the Honorary Minister, that the **British** Government is virtually finding the money for "a fleet, practically correct.

* I refer to the words "employ directly or indirectly other than white **British** subjects."

* They are reserved for naval service in time of emergency, and consequently they must have all **British** subjects on board.

* There is no reason why we should confuse the issue of a white and coloured Australia by using such an exclusive term as "**British** subjects."

* We have no right to place a ban upon them to the extent indicated, because if they are employed on the mail steamers - those steamers being reserve naval ships - they must be **British** subjects.

* It seems to me that their methods simply offer a premium or inducement to the **British** Government to take exception to this provision.

* Only a few weeks ago, I endeavoured to secure a mail service to King Island, which is a **British** settlement containing a population of 700 white men and women.

* there are only 214 **British** subjects and thirty-four missionaries.

* It is now proposed that we should increase the mail subsidy to these islands by 6,000, despite the fact that an island situated midway between Victoria and Tasmania, upon which are settled 700 whitehearted, white **British** subjects, cannot obtain adequate mail communication with the mainland.

* In Tasmania, there are places like Camp Creek and Rover Creek, where there are from 200 to 300 **British** subjects, and which are denied the benefit of a post-office because it would involve an expenditure of 15 a year.

* By acting thus, he deprived **British** subjects who had resided there for forty years of the benefits conferred by a daily mail.

* From the " Statistical Abstracts of **British** Trade," which can be seen in the Library.

* He said that if the French troops would only smoke French tobacco the **British** Army would never face them.

* To-day **British** consols are returning only 22/1 per cent., and I venture to say that the construction of the eight vessels which will be required to undertake our new mail service will not cost more than 312,500 each.

* It means something more than the mere flying of the Australian flag over a **British** ship.

* If the PostmasterGeneral is so solicitous for the welfare of 
T - This definition of the term " **British** possession " does not oblige us to use the words in our future legislation; but I have adopted it because I find it in the Imperial Acts Interpretation Act, and because it will be convenient, if ever we use the phrase in any Commonwealth Act, that it shall "mean there exactly what it means in the English Act.

* I agree with the honorable member that, if we were referring to the great Dominion of Canada, to what may yet be the South African Dominion, or to this Commonwealth, we should seek more appropriate language than is here employed ; and there is a great deal to be said in support of his contention that in the course of time these words which, perhaps, were very applicable a century ago, have now ceased to be so applicable to a great portion of the **British** Empire ; but that need not deter us, if we do use the phrase, from using, it in its accepted sense.

* The Opposition have time after time expressed its full belief in the principle of the preferential treatment of **British** goods; but they have announced their decided objection to the Government proposals, since they believethat they simply impose disabilities upon the **British** nation and **British** goods.

* It has been clearly demonstrated that the total preference proposed to be given to **British** goods does not exceed  2  per cent.

* **British** imports.

* After the stormy passage which they had to make under free-trade, with foreign and **British** rings combining to stifle colonial industry, it is remarkable that none of our factories have been strangled, and that none of our manufacturers come on their knees to the protectionists of Melbourne to beg for assistance to keep their enterprises alive.

* The writers of the letter are Messrs. Cohen, Nelson, and Co. 
As the honorable member for Melbourne Ports interjects, this compulsion is foreign to **British** methods, and I do not approve of it at 'all - first, because it- is un-**British** and foreign ; and secondly, because I do not think it is at all necessary.

* It is essentially foreign to the genius of **British** administration for any department of public business in dealing with any class of  His  Majesty's subjects to make innocent mistakes the ground of police court prosecutions.

* Mistakes in the beginning of a new Tariff are absolutely certain to happen, as fraud is absolutely certain to be attempted ; but if the whole business community are put into the police court, whether they be guilty of fraud or innocent error, then the business men of Australia are exposed to persecution, which is a disgrace, and foreign to the methods of administration in the **British** Empire.

* The **British** trades unionists have been spoken of by Lord Rosebery as the aristocracy of labour - not an aristocracy with which the idea of wealth is associated, .

* The best examples of the qualities which we most admire in the **British** race, are to be found in the history of the trades union movement.

* It is a sensible application of the betterment principle which has been advocated all over the **British** Empire.

* It is well known that Rand stocks are not held entirely by **British** investors and speculators.

* The great question is whether we, as an integral part of the Empire, are justified in interfering by making a suggestion either to the **British** Government.

* Outside of the United States, and including about fifteen portions' of the **British** dominions, the salaries paid to the Judges do not represent anything like the sum which it is proposed to pay to the occupants of the High Court.

* Probably it has been framed on the lines of the Merchant Shipping Act, which is, 1 suppose, the finest Act in the **British** dominions.

* I desire to say that to-morrow we shall, as announced, proceed with our proposal to extend a preference to **British** goods in **British** ships.

* But the good sense of **British** communities led them to the  conclusion  that without the right of combination there could be no real freedom of contract, because to get actual and ideal freedom of contract, the contracting parties must be upon an equality, so that they may bargain fairly and reasonably with each other.

* It would be as well, however, to mention what was the attitude of the Secretary of State, as representing the **British** Government at the conference.

* In 1S97 the Weights and Measures or Metric System Act, 60 and 61 Viet., c 46, was passed by the .**British** Parliament.

* Numbers of these fellows get off the ships at Fremantle, get on board the trains, go up to Kalgoorlie, and are employed almost immediately on arriving there, whilst **British** workmen are thrown out of employment.

* Further, in connexion with the signalling that takes place in the mines, these fellows are unacquainted with the conditions that prevail, and are a source of danger, not only to themselves, but to the **British** workmen who work with them.

* I have risen to protest against the supersession of the **British** flag by what is called the Australian flag in connexion with our Military and Naval Forces.

* I hope that we are not to have a permanent supersession of the **British** flag.

* I merely desire to guard against the dropping of the practice of flying the **British** flag over our public buildings, and in connexion with our Naval and Military Forces.

* We have no reason to be ashamed of the **British** flag.

* Every honorable member knows I refer to the Union Jack and **British** ensign.

* The Australian flag cannot be described as the **British** flag, but the Union Jack is the **British** flag as we know it.

* I raise this point, because I know that there is on the part of a certain section of the representatives of the people in this Parliament a strong undercurrent of antipathy to anything **British**.

* I do not wish to see anything in the nature of an indignity offered to the **British** flag.

* It ill becomes some of our young Australian friends to  attempt  to put a slight on the **British** flag.

* I remind them that their forefathers were Britishers, and would not have been in this country but for the protection of **British** rule.

* We are now making a departure from this principle of **British** liberty.

* Is it fair, under these circumstances, to depart from the accepted principle of **British** law, and hold a party guilty until he has proved his innocence?

* The first is the MasseyHarris Company, a Canadian company, of which the proprietors and workmen are **British** subjects, carrying on busi-ness in Toronto, and which distributes over 55,000 a year in Australia in wages and other similar expenditure.

* And for this reason - that from that moment, according to the constitutional practice in all **British** countries, the duties are collected in accordance with the terms of the resolution.

* Clause 5 is only intended to give extra territorial effect to the laws of the Commonwealth with regard to **British** ships trading between various ports of the 'Commonwealth on  'One  continuous voyage. '

* An attempt was made by a high ecclesiastical gentleman in New South Wales to interfere with the negotiations of the Government so as to create a wrong impression as to the purpose and meaning of the visit, and to read into it a covertly hostile demonstration against the **British** nation.

* They also made it clear that the fleet visited New Zealand and Australia, not only as a compliment to the people of these Dominions, but chiefly as a compliment to the **British** Empire, of which they form so important a part.

* The late  Mr. Seddon,  when he acceded to the wishes of the manufacturers of New Zealand, provided not only for their protection, but also for preference to **British** manufacturers.

* How can he vote for such a measure when he must know that, if its provisions are strictly carried into effect, **British** manufacturers will be excluded from our markets.

* In our humanity we have provided in the Papua (**British** New Guinea) Bill that certain funds shall be appropriated to the assistance of infirm or destitute natives.

* It was explained that the prisoner was the first white man ever sentenced to death in **British** New Guinea.

* As almost the whole of the importations under this head come from Great Britain, it is clear that the duty would be almost entirely against the importation of **British** products.

* I shall intimate later on the direction in which my mind has been working with regard to the solution of this problem, and to show that the great mass of our best thinkers and ablest politicians have been moving, however blindly, in this direction - that they have been endeavouring to see how the difficulties, which have been experienced not only in the Federal Parliament, but in all the Parliaments of the **British** Dominions where the Executive system of government has been adopted, can be removed.

* It will be my endeavour to show, as the honorable member for Perth has done, by reference to the development of the **British** Constitution, that the ideal under which this very system was brought into existence has been departed from by reason of the power which Cabinets have asserted.

* That the House do now adjourn,  it is with the greatest possible satisfaction that I have the honour to inform honorable members that we have to-day succeeded in completing, provisionally, a treaty for reciprocity with **British** South Africa.

* The difficulty has been that almost the whole of the trade between the two countries consists of exports from Australia to **British** South Africa, our imports from there being very small at present.

* Philp, and Company the charges levied upon them for the right to trade in the Marshall Islands, which are altogether beyond the sphere of **British** influence.

* I do not see any reason why the steamers should be required to call at all sorts of outside places, beyond the sphere of **British** influence, merely to suit the convenience of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company.

* The idea of conscript tion has always been utterly repugnant to **British** people.

* From infancy we have been taught to regard conscription as something which the **British** people both here and in the old world will not endure.

* We must depend for years hence upon the **British** Navy.

* ; but let me point out that- 1872 was a boom year - that from 1870 to 1872 **British** trade increased, as the result of the FrancoGerman war, to the extent of some 60,000,000.

* He would have us believe that this is a proper comparison- 
If the values which prevailed in 1872 had ruled in 1902 the value of **British** trade in the last-named year  would have- been r 50,000,000 greater than it was.

* If honorable members will take the **British** Tariff they will find that there is raised by customs duties about 23,000,000 a year, of which only about 1,000,000 is obtained on articles somewhat similar to those on this Tariff.

* If it be true that there is no similarity between Great Britain and Australia - and I emphasize it for the sake of getting it at last into that nebulous thing which is known as the grey tissue of their brains - if honorable members concede that they have to obtain between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000, and that if they had the **British** Tariff they would collect only 100,000, the reference is a contrast, and not a comparison.

* But I say without any hesitation that it ought net to be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to make some concession to New Zealand in the matter of trade, which will not shut us out from New Zealand markets, but which, on the contrary, will enable us to secure the same preferences as are granted bv New Zealand to **British** South Africa.

* I point out to the Government, however, that the case is sufficiently urgent, and that business interests involved are so large as to warrant Ministers in entering into negotiations at the very earliest moment, with a view to concluding some equitable business arrangement between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, which will, at least, place us on as good a footing in, doing trade with that part of the Empire as is **British** South Africa.

* In determining what procedure to recommend, we had first to consider section 49 of the Constitution, which enacts that the powers, privileges, and immunities of the Parliament shall be such as are declared by it, and that, until they are so declared, they shall be those of the **British** House of Commons.

* The **British** House of Commons has hitherto been the sole judge of what constitutes a breach of.

* I do not indorse his observations to the effect that the white men who are employed in the stoke-holes of the mail steamers represent the "scum " of the **British** race.

* I express no opinion whatever as to the character of those people, or  as to the desirability or otherwise of purging the **British** marine of coloured labour.

* At the same time I am not prepared to go beyond the limits of the Commonwealth and to declare that black **British** subjects shall be denied employment by the **British** Empire or by the- **British** mercantile marine.

* To drive these coloured men out of **British** ships at the expense of the Australian taxpayer would be a monstrous injustice.

* To-day he meets us with a smile upon his face, being evidently under the impression that it is the smile which **British** statesmen are wont to assume upon coming out of  salons.

* The principle of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Great Britain embodies the most up-to-date law inthe **British** Dominions dealing with this question.

* That shows that the Territory was known to other generations and was visited by ships before we, as colonists, settled in any part of the continent, and certainly, if it is the magnificent country that some would have us believe, the colonizing instincts of 'hose who visited the northern shores of Australia long before the **British** landed on this continent would have induced them to form settlements there.

* Will the Prime Minister consider the advisableness of the Commonwealth securing the services of the champion brass band of Australia - the Newtown Band - to perform in the Australian Court at the Franco- **British** Exhitftion, as part- of the scheme for advertising Australia, for which this House has just voted20,000?

* For the first time in the history of a **British** Parliament, there is a deliberate proposal: to put the power of prohibiting trade outside Parliament.

* We have established trading relations with other parts of the **British** Empire, and with the rest of the world, meeting differences in skill, advancement, numbers, or efficiency between our workmen and their competitors by the imposition of duties,.

* That vessel was given to the three States administering the Territory by the **British** Government and she has cost us nothing, except perhaps indirectly in helping to maintain the Administration, as carried on by these States for a number of years.

* the CommanderinChief of the **British** Army, who, after years of service, retire on a pension.

* If she had so chosen, she could have handed it over to a chartered syndicate, whether foreign or **British**.

* Is there any other place under the **British** flag where a similar proposition could be made?

* The cost of manning for the **British** Navy, as compared with the German figures, affords a striking example of the difference in cost between voluntary and compulsory service.

* No doubt of it; but the Admiralty engage with the whole **British** fleet to look after that, and I hope the honorable member will disabuse his mind of the idea that I want the Australian fleet to go to China, unless there is real danger of eventualities.

* Not for the purposes of **British** trade, as some people have suggested, but for the purposes of protection and defence of the Empire.

* That is to say, there is such great demand for the raw material in the United States, that there is at the present time a shortage in the old country ; and the **British** Cotton Growers' Association has been formed with the view of promoting the growth of cotton within the **British** Empire, their attention being directed to Australia, amongst other countries.

* Within the last few years, since the study of tropical diseases was systematically undertaken, especially by the **British** Colonial Office, the advances made in the preservation of life and health in the tropics have been enormous.

* This is borne out by the experience of **British** residents in the worst parts of Africa.

* They will consist of Australians and New Zealanders to the very greatest extent possible, but if it happens, before the full complement of these men has been made up, that there are some of the **British** bluejackets on those vessels there will be something in the objection thatit would be invidious to have two rates of pay operating on the same vessel.

* That is a way by which the  invidiousness  complained of may be avoided, and avoided all the more easily when it4 is considered that, although the Australians and New Zealanders who serve in these ships are to receive higher rates of pay than the men of the **British** navy, Jack will be comforted by the reflection that at the end of his term of service he will be entitled to draw a pension, whereas the provision which we are making does not carry with it that advantage.

* A well- known firm of **British** makers has found it more profitable to manufacture in the Colony than to pay the Victorian duty.

* If the people of the mother country would do as  Mr. Chamberlain  wishes' them to do, and give a small preference to the products of the **British** dependencies, I believe that production would be stimulated to such an extent that before long the Empire could supply itself with foodstuffs.

* the wages paid in an industry are to form the test by which the admission or prohibition of goods is to be decided, and notwithstanding all the clap-trap we have heard from Ministers about preferential trade with England, there is not a single line of **British** manufactures the introduction of which might not be objected to if that is to be the test applied.

* I should like to know if the Minister will agree to exempt **British** goods from the operation of the Bill?

* The decision of the Imperial authorities to obtain in future from the **British** possessions- all the supplies of meat required for the **British** Army, is a great thing for Australia and New Zealand, from which these supplies will be chiefly drawn.

* The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has stated that the existence of scandals caused the **British** Parliament to alter its previous system.

* Before I got into Parliament my confidence in a legal tribunalwas shocked by the effects of the **British** system.

* For instance, no distinction is made in any entries or returns between produce grown by **British** and foreign settlers : the materials for making such distinction not being procurable.

* As a matter of fact, the point had never been taken in Sydney, and, therefore, the question could not have been argued ; but if it had been taken, it would have been known at once that the jurisdiction was claimed under an unrepealed section of a **British** Act - an Act which had been repealed and re-enacted in Great Britain, but was still held to be in force in New South Wales.

* The **British** Parliament has carefully exempted all questions as to the constitutional powers between the Commonwealth and the States or between the States themselves.

* So long as we remain an integral part of the **British** Empire - and I hope that the connexion will continue^ - I suppose we must have some intermediary between the Crown and the Commonwealth.

* In the past we have been too much given to preferring imported timbers, and are only just -realizing the value of a possession which we have been allowing to go to waste, although persons outside the Commonwealth have long ago realized, its value, and even the **British** Admiralty is beginning to recognise the usefulness of Australian timber, as the following cablegram shows - 
I allude, of course, to employers in the more stable industries.

* I say that if Australian employers and workmen are not prepared to move along the same lines they must be much more unreasonable than are their **British** comrades.

* It is well known that the **British** workmen have always declared themselves absolutely opposed to compulsory arbitration.

* I see, for example, thai the Queensland Act relating to the driving of cattle through populous towns is in force in **British** New Guinea.

* The **British** Government have undertaken to maintain a certain force in Australian waters, with the understanding that the force at present maintained here is by no means to be the only force that will be maintained in times of necessity.

* The sum which we contribute is only about one- 150th of the total cost of the **British** Navy.

* The **British** Government have undertaken to defend us from attack beyond the seas, which is the only kind of attack we have to fear.

* My idea, as honorable, members are all aware, 'is that the kind of navy which we require in the **British** Empire is not a separate small navy for Australia, a navy for New Zealand, a navy for the Cape, and a navy for Canada.

* If the **British** Navy lost command of the sea, it would be the prelude to the dissolution of the great Empire which has grown up almost iri our own day.

* Let us pull together and stand shoulder to shoulder for the Empire; and do not let us call our Navy the English Navy, or the Navy of the **British** Isles, but the Empire's Navy - that is, the Navy of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and every other **British** possession.

* That is sufficiently exemplified by the attitude which the Prime Minister has adopted towards the **British** immigrants proposed to be introduced by General Booth.

* Minister has exaggerated unnecessarily the alterations of the law required with regard to **British** immigrants.

* But the new clause that we are now discussing goes further than thisand says that we shall not allow any ships coming here and receiving public money for carrying our mails to employ any otherlabour than that of **British** white subjects.

* Then, again, the **British** Government may not see their way to enter into a contract on the lines that are now proposed, because the cost involved would be so much greater.

* But I would ask - Has that principle ever been established in the **British** Parliament ?

* This principle has never been established in any **British** Parliament.

* The feeling pervading the whole **British** Empire is that it should possess a force which should be purely of a defensive character, and not for purposes of aggression.

* If we are going to specially consider the importer of **British** produce or manufactures in a foreign ship, we should, upon the same principle, extend consideration to the importer of foreign goods in a **British** ship.

* It moy, of course, be said that in building up another Britain, in the Southern Hemisphere, thus providing another home for our countrymen, and by extending **British** influence and trade, we have been doing a greater work for the Empire than by contributing towards Imperial naval defence ; but I think the time has gone by for us to use such arguments', as both duty and stern necessity require that we shall stand shoulder to shoulder with the motherland in the determination to maintain inviolate the integrity of the Empire.

* It would be interesting to know the exact motives which have influenced Canada to refrain from making any contribution to its naval defence, while every other portion of the **British** Empire contributes something or other to its naval defence.

* The **British** Imperial Oil Company was the first to import kerosene in bulk, but only 10 per cent.

* Although the honorable member for Cook would not accept the assurance of men who have considered the question, and who are thoroughly convinced that the strike amongst the employes of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation has been settled on fair terms, he is as solid a member of the Labour Party as we have, and surely it is **British** and Australian, when a quarrel is over, to let the hand-clasp be firm.

* Generally, I am a strong advocate for the State control of the liquor traffic, not only in **British** New Guinea, but throughout the Commonwealth.

* I think that liquor, except so far as it may be required for medicinal purposes, should be excluded from **British** New Guinea.

* That is another principle in which I believe; but I do not see how it can be applied to the circumstances of **British** New Guinea.

* I refer to a scheme which would provide for the transmission of cablegrams which would be open to the whole of the **British** press.

* Newfoundland, the oldest Colony of Great Britain, was left out of the Federation of **British** North Ame'rica, and she is still outside it.

* .- While having no sympathy with combines and trusts, I must say that some of the provisions of the Bill are, in my humble opinion, contradictory to **British** fair play and justice.

* That does not, savour of the **British** justj.ce that is being constantly belauded.

* I would say to her - " You open your ports to us, and I am prepared to give you a preferential tariff without waiting for the result of the **British** elections, and without waiting to see what you will give us in return.

* down for **British** goods, whilst at the same time I should not care how high it was made against the foreigner.

* In the former case it is unmistakably shown that the contracts were made upon the responsibility of the **British** Government, and were afterwards submitted in their completed form to the House of Commons.

* A little while ago  Mr. Haldane  commenced a speech in the House of Commons by pointing out that there is no design or system in connexion with the **British** Army: 
I will show its application in the course of a few minutes if the right honorable n.ember will permit me to do so.

* There are many good officers in the **British** Army who do not wish to be given their military titles while in private life.

* If they compare with the **British** soldier, God help the latter.

* Is it not a fact that these republics have been taken possession of, that industry and commerce are maintained, and everything else is pursuing almost its normal course, but that these 10,000 or 13,000 people are standing in this aggressive attitude, waiting for every opportunity to destroy the railways, and the farms, and in everyway to break in upon the peace and harmony of the community  1  Yet the honorable and learned member would lead the public of Australia to suppose that the **British** are there endeavouring to crush these' poor devils into the earth, to kill them, to mutilate them, or behave in any other inhuman manner towards them.

* What are the **British** people fighting for ?

* They say - "We propose to establish in these two republics great **British** colonies, in which there shall be the freest citizenship in the world, equal to that' in- Australia.

* Our action in assisting the Empire has the twofold effect of satisfying the patriotism of every wholesomely-constructed citizen and of recognising our obligation to the **British** Empire.

* Has it not been demonstrated to Germany and Russia and France that if either of them, or all three of them, come to loggerheads with Great Britain she may count not only upon the **British** colonies, but possibly upon the whole of the Anglo-Saxon races of the world ?

* It has consolidated the **British** Empire, and it has brought us together.

* That is the object of this legislation, but it is not the aim of **British** legislation.

* I understand that a local manufacturer's business was acquired by a well-known firm of **British** fuse-makers, subject to the condition that the vendor should not resume operations here.

* We are told - although I cannot say whether or not the statement' is correct - that through the agency of some of his relatives, the latter once more set up in business, with the result that the **British** firm, which had established its business here, and which is a large user of fuse powder, induced the sellers of that explosive in Great Britain to refrain from accepting any further orders from their local opponent.

* As a number of explosives which are permitted to be used are made in Great Britain, surely if we have any serious intention to extend the preference proposed we should insist on preference for these **British** goods.

* I am not certain that the extension of the 10 per cent, preference to **British** goods will increase the cost of the articles to the consumer by anything like that amount.

* To increase the duty on foreign explosives by 10 per cent, will not necessarily increase the price of them bv that amount, and so far as concerns the explosives mentioned as being used in coal mines in New South Wales, it seems to me that those who believe in preference have a right to give some form of encouragement to **British** manufactures in this respect.

* Is it a fact that the effect of this instruc tion was that the publications described could get their cover papers in free if **British**, or  10  per cent, if Foreign, instead of paying 15 per cent, or  20  per cent, under the Tariff?

* **British** or Foreign origin?

* Be that as it may, the great patriotism which has been so eloquently descanted upon by the Prime Minister is represented, after all, by the fact that we are going to build a naval unit by means of **British** money contributed by the **British** taxpayer.

* The Princess Royal was a woman who endeared herself to every man of **British** blood by her thoroughly English character.

* Her  husband, the Emperor Frederick, was, as we all know, one of the greatest friends on the Continent of the **British** Empire to which his wife belonged.

* I notice that  Mr. Mosely,  in speaking of the difference between American and English workmen, refers tothe efforts of **British** workmen to limit production.

* I am convinced that **British** manufacturers, if they are to obtain the best efforts from their workmen, must come to an understanding with the Unions as to a fair piece price, from which there shall be no " cutting when the men earn large Wages.

* I shall advocate only measures intended to guard against the mistakes which have been made by the old nations of the world, and I hope that in the future - perhaps not in the early future - Australia will be not looked upon as the dumping-ground and tail-end of the Empire, but as one of the greatest and brightest territories under the **British** flag.

* It has been decided that a vessel leaving Calcutta, going to London, discharging portion of her cargo there, and then going on to some other port in the **British** Isles, as the port of final destination, is not a vessel engaged in the coasting trade.

* There have been decisions on other prescriptions of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, to the effect that ocean vessels sailing from one port in the **British** Dominions, and touching, in the course of their voyage to the final port of destination, another **British** port, are not vessels coming within the coasting trade provisions.

* Under the present measure the provision is made to apply only to cases in which a **British** ship begins and concludes her voyage within the limits of the Commonwealth.

* We get the protection of the **British** Navy for a very small consideration.

* The **British** Navy protects our interests in our mutual commerce, and it also protects our share of our commerce with **British** possessions which never touches the shores of Great Britain, and in which that country; is.

* Sixty-one per cent, of the trade between the United Kingdom and foreign countries is carried in **British** vessels, and we should therefore be careful not to injure the freight earnings of the Mother Country.

* Vessels of **British** registration, representing 106,000,000 tons, were entered and cleared at foreign ports in 1902, while only 48,600,000 tons of foreign registration were entered and cleared at **British** ports.

* The  Times,  in a series of articles written to aid  Mr. Chamberlain's  policy of reprisals against foreigners and preferential duties, had to admit, after a very careful consideration of the whole question from the point of view of the shipping trade, that that trade afforded a noble target for reprisals by  foreign  countries, and that even if subsidies were granted, as was suggested, to **British** shipping about 47 per cent, of the ships of **British** registration would be prejudicially affected.

* I have been looking through the evidence given before the select committee of the House of Commons on **British** and foreign spirits, and I have found some interesting facts bearing upon the comparative merits of the different kinds of spirits.

* - I think the result of the investigation of the **British**  Commission  or of the evidence that the French Commission received was this : That taking tlie wine spirit, the spirit obtained from the wine, which would be a genuine brandy, the ingredients in that were less deleterious than in those obtained from spirit derived from grain.

* He was taken out of his bed about nine o'clock one night, and  escorted  to an hotel in **British** New Guinea, where he was brought before certain justices, and tried on this charge.. Depositions were taken, but in this, as in the other case, they cannot be found.

* He asks nothing more than that which any man living under the **British** flag has a right to expect - a fair trial by a jury of his countrymen, and 1 hope that the Prime Minister will appoint a Committee in order that his case mav be re-heard.

* .This book, from which I propose to quote, was published in 1S98, and the author endeavours to show that the black races were originally generated in the tropical areas where living was easiest, whereas our **British** races are the product of men who, by evolution, brought about by the  harder  work they had to do in the temperate and colder regions, became stronger and stronger, and gradually established a hardier, more robust and vigorous constitution.

* This writer says - 
The strong brawny **British** workman is employed there, and I believe that he is not materially disadvantaged by the class of work in which he is engaged, although I am sorry to think that his children may be disadvantaged.

* In referring to the case of the six hatters who were denied admission to the Commonwealth, until the intelligence had been cabled not only over the **British** Empire, but over the whole civilized world, the Prime Minister waxed indignant at any person attempting to criticise the Immigration Restriction Act.

* It will be remembered that when the Bill containing the education test for immigrants was under consideration, it was pointed out over and over again that the provision, if strictly enforced, would shut out, not only numbers of reputable Europeans who would make most excellent colonists, but might also shut out hundreds and thousands of **British** subjects.

* There are numbers of **British** subjects who could not pass an educational test, and who nevertheless might be industrious, reputable, honest people, and would make desirable colonists.

* The consequence was that the people on the gold-fields were compelled to apply to the **British** authorities, and it was entirely owing to the separation movement that Western Australia is now a State of the union.

* In the scheme which I desire to see adopted, the granting of pensions should not be subject to review except where the recipient has not been resident in Australia for the prescribed number of years or is not a **British** subject.

* A country occupying that position may reasonably be asked to Sanction a Federal scheme of old-age pensions which will have no taint of charity about it, and which will apply to all **British** subjects who have lived in the Commonwealth for the prescribed period.

* I believe nhat there should be trade reciprocity between the different portions of the **British** Empire.

* But all proper information should be given to the country, especially in view of the fact that telegrams are coming out from **British** Ministers, our own representative, and others, as to what their individual opinion is.

* The Prime Minister knows, as well as I know - I was with him at the time - what the views of **British** Ministers are.

* In discussing questions of the relative powers of the Union and the States, the exposition of their Constitution by American jurists, whether in their judgments or their commentaries, had always been founded on the principles of construction which had been equally adopted as guides by **British** lawyers.

* We think that, sitting here, we are entitled to assume - what, after all, is a fact of public notoriety - that some, if not all, of the framers of that Constitution were familiar not only with the Constitution of the United States, but with that of the Canadian Dominion and those of the **British** Colonies.

* Purely patriotic considerations should lead us to recognise that it is time we established a Commonwealthowned line of steamers, in which we could1 train seamen, not for the **British** Navy, but for our own Australian Navy.

* The **British** Government at one time believed in paying subsidies, but now it has discontinued them on the American lines of steamers.

* There has been an invention in England by a man named Perrin, who, after considerable delay such as all inventors experience, succeeded in getting his appliance brought under the notice of the **British** public.

* But the inventor's rights have been sold in America, a company there having paid the **British** company over 1,000,000 for the privilege of manufacturing tubes and pipes of all classes under this process.

* A change was made ' in that year because Provinces which, like **British** Columbia, joined the Union later, had received only  80  cents a head, and that was limited to a population of  400,000  persons.

* The Dominion Parliament makes a representation in a certain way, and the **British** Parliament passes an Act carrying it out.

* The rule followed in the past has been to adopt the rifle used in the **British** army- 
Has the Prime Minister received a reply to his recent cablegram to the **British** authorities in connexion with the New Hebrides?

* to which we belong, and that what we now propose to do with regard to the -ships of the mother land is not done towards us in any part of the **British** dominions.

* We know very well that our existence here as a people is dependent upon the fact that we are a part of the great **British** Empire, and yet we are not prepared to differentiate in the least degree in favour of our own countrymen.

* Of that number only 6,671 were carried by oversea ships; viz., 2,352 carried by foreign ships and 4,319 by **British** ships.

* The coastal passenger traffic totalled 102,871, of which number 16,189 were carried by oversea steamers - 13,577 by **British** vessels, and 2,612 by foreign vessels.

* Of the latter number, 11,042 were carried by **British**, and only 2,102 by foreign vessels.

* Steamers which are not **British**.

* But there is certainly no necessity whatever why we should interfere in the slightest degree with ocean-going vessels, and particularly with those that belong to **British** lines.

* I have not said much about **British** shipping; but, as no one can show any need for this foolish legislation, it is a poor business when, under such circumstances, Australia is placarded throughout the length and breadth of the Empire as taking unfriendly action against the mother country.

* At any rate, I do not know of any part of the **British** Empire which would so legislate in regard to the mother country, on which we depend for defence, and to which we are always saying we are proud to belong.

* When this general discussion is finished, I intend to submit an amendment that oversea **British** ships trading to and from Australia and calling at ports, as the P. and O., Orient, and other steamers do at the present time, shall be exempt from the operation of the Bill.

* Under these treaties **British** legislation has been passed, and it has been possible under it for the several States to so legislate as to apply the **British** law.

* We propose to remove that doubt by treating the Commonwealth as one **British** possession, by vesting in the GovernorGeneral the authority under the Imperial Act, and by enabling him to appoint his deputies in the States to carry it out.

* Amongst the whole of the **British** possessions Canada is the only one which has set aside **British** law in respect of this question, and enacted legislation of her own which prescribes not merely the procedure under which the Dominion will grant extraditicm, but provides that application for the extradition of persons who have committed offences within its borders may be made directly to any foreign Power instead of through the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

* If we imposed a duty 'of 100 per cent, as against the foreigner, and of 95 per cent, as against **British** imports, would not that be a preference?

* upon candles of **British** manufacture when the principal commodity of which they are composed is dutiable at only id.

* Every one who supports the idea of an Australian Navy, and is anxious for the extension of Australian national sentiment in that regard, will regret that an honorable' and learned member, under the guise of trying to push ahead this, in some ways, very laudable ambition, has made insinuations as to the integrity of a people and a Government to whom ' we owe much, and as to the honesty of the **British** naval officers on this station.

* I have never looked at the Agreement from the narrow, selfish point of view, trying to determine the exact value of the monetary  quid fro quo;  but those who care to do so, and wish to know pre cisely the advantages which Australia obtains under it, should be interested to hear that, while our contribution is only about 200,000 a year, the **British** authorities spend 700,000 per annum, or three times as much, in Australia, and, in addition, we get a large number of men trained in the finest naval service in .the world.

* Respect for the late Queen and the great and noble work she did whilst she discharged the important 'functions of the ruler of tHe **British** Empire would not be best expressed by a vote for the purpose indicated.

* I recognise that whilst the **British** Empire is enormously wealthy, millions of  His  Majesty's subjects are living on the very verge of starvation.

* Where is that party who opposed the Turner Government, although it came into power stronger than any party under the **British** flag?

* It was my privilege to introduce the first Women's Suffrage Bill in any **British** Legislature, but on that occasion I could not get a seconder.

* The proposal of the honorable member for Wimmera is that we should pass a high Tariff against the world, fixing rates which would keep out both **British** and foreign importations, and then, as a pretended preference to the mother coujntry, raise the rates against foreign countries still higher.

* The commerce of Canada enjoys the protection of the **British** Fleet just as does that of Australia, yet she contributes nothing to the Imperial Navy.

* If we, like Canada, declined to make any contribution towards the expenditure upon the **British** Navy, it would still be to the interest of Great Britain to protect us, so long as she felt that we remained part and parcel of the Empire.

* What is the **British** ./race to-day but the progeny of various nationalities.

* To my surprise, Parliament agreed to the taking over of the control of **British** New Guinea without a division.

* I believe that the people of Australia are scarcely conscious that we have acquired **British** New Guinea.

* It has been said, and said with pride, that one of our Army Medical Corps, sent from New South Wales under  Colonel Williams,  proved a lesson and an example even to the **British** Medical Corps in South Africa.

* place of disadvantages it would give them in common with all their fellow-subjects an advantage in the Im perial markets, and take in .return a reciprocal advantage in the Colonial markets ; the first markets in the world, instead of being opened as now to all without distinction, would give a preference to **British** subjects.

* Instead of providing for it, as the Government have done; bv the addition of a second column to the schedule, I should insert in the covering Bill a clause providing that preferences of jo per cent.,  15  per cent., or  20  per cent., should be given to every part of the **British** Empire that was prepared to grant corresponding concessions to Australia..

* They are fancy biscuits which the **British** manufacturer can turn out cheaply, because of his large local market and his export trade, but it would be unprofitable for our manufacturers to make them.

* above the prices at which Britishmade biscuits of the same kind can be bought, and, in some instances, Australian biscuits are as cheap as **British** biscuits.

* Of course, I know that some honorable members objected to the  Dreadnought  offer ; but it came before the **British** people in such a form as to impress them with our sincerity in desiring to be, not merely a nominal, but an.

* It might have been, as some honorable members say, a paroxysm of feeling ; but whatever prompted the pffer of a  Dreadnought,  it had the result of impressing upon the Home Government and the **British** people our sincerity in desiring to take a hand in the affairs of the Empire.

* The procedure, to my mind, is most unusual, and has never been equalled in any **British** Legislature.

* I am desirous, not of coming into conflict with the Chair, but of protecting, if I can protect, those liberties which have been enjoyed bv representatives for centuries in the **British** House of Commons and in all English speaking Legislatures, and which have now, for the first time, so far as my knowledge goes, been ruthlessly assailed.

* I think that he would have done well had he reminded the Committee of the area which is embraced by **British** New Guinea.

* There are handfuls of white miners scattered over great areas, in the valleys, leading to German from **British** New Guinea.

* Has  His  Majesty's Opposition, which throughout the centuries has been regarded as one of the most majestic of the institutions of the **British** Empire, sunk to such a state of degradation that they intend practically to lay all ideas of principle aside?

* The measure was passed under pressure from the **British** Government - a pressure which a consider able number of honorable members of this Parliament wisely, or unwisely, did not withstand.

* That in the opinion of this meeting the policy of the **British** Government in their conduct of the war in South Africa meets with the approval of all loyal South Australians."

* Whatever our feelings may be in regard to the conductof the war in South Africa, or as to the attitude taken up by  Mr. Chamberlain  on behalf of the **British** Government, we must admit that it is in the highest degree reprehensible that members of the military forces as such should be directed by the Minister for Defence to attend a public meeting of the character of that to be held in Adelaide to-night.

* The presumption is that **British** silver coins will circulate in Australia without limit, while Australian coins will not be negotiable in Great Britain.

* Has the Treasurer made provision to prevent any further inflow of **British** silver coins?

* The honorable member for North Sydney did not convince me that it is impossible for the **British** Government to allow Australian coins to circulate in England.

* I think that the arrangement the **British** Government are making with us we could make with them - there might be a reciprocal arrangement to retire a certain number of coins annually.

* Last night we discussed an agreement for reciprocal trade between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and I hope very shortly to make a similar proposition in regard to another **British** dependency.

* reciprocal relations between Great Britain and her colonies will cause a great influx of **British** white persons into Australia.

* (**British**), is.

* At that time, its leaders and foremost men were Tory parliamentarians and Tory members of the **British** peerage.

* Nearly every Tory peer in the **British** Parliament at that time, and up to 1835, was a member of the organization; in fact, it then comprised very few others of notoriety.

* Notwithstanding the explanation of the Attorney-General as to the high  character of the  **British** tribunals, we can hardlybeled to suppose that if the High Court is to be as good even as the best of these it will attain to that state of perfection suggested by him as not only possible but probable.

* I think we ought to have the best tribunal, and I do not think the Privy Council is the best available, even in the **British** Empire.

* The rule followed in the past has been to adopt the rifle used  in  the **British** Army.

* On the last division, I voted with the Government for what I consider is a very full measure of protection, but they are placing me, and, I am sure, other honorable members in the Opposition corner, in a false position by resisting the proposal that this duty foe reduced as against **British** imports from 2d.

* They readily gave way when it was proposed that a preference should be granted to **British** manufacturers of biscuits, and the principle underlying the proposal in this instance is the same.

* Consequently, the original provisions in relation to coloured peoples have affected **British** citizens who seek to enter the Commonwealth under contracts to perform manual labour.

* No free- man of the **British** race,, or of allied races,  nasi  ever been prevented under the Immigration Restriction Act from!

* mail ships shall be manned, not merely by white men, but by white men of **British** nationality.

* We- might have.a clause in all contracts, providing that vessels carrying mails should be manned by **British** white subjects ; or we could go a step further - and if we decide to refuse to pay for black labour, I should be inclined to support this proposal - and make these vessels a training ground for Australian seamen.

* Is the Government aware that  Mr. Max  Hirsch has been appointed Victorian correspondent of the **British** Board of Trade?

* It was contrary to the constitutional principles of all **British** communities to deliberately undertake to form an Administration when he knew that he had not a majority on his general programme.

* Does the honorable member imagine that a community of **British** people would submit to society - and I use the word "society" in its broadest sense - being completely subverted according to principles which have never been successfully embodied in the laws of any community in the world?

* In connexion with the matter of aliens and the extent to which foreigners, chiefly Italians and Austrians, are displacing **British** workers, a meeting of Kalgoorlie ratepayers last night indorsed the request by the municipal council that a Royal Commission should be appointed to investigate the matter.

* Having lived in Victoria for many years, and having a full knowledge, of its conditions, I do not hesitate to say that, in no other **British** community hasmore been done to remove the inequalities of  the various classes.

* Section 5 of the Constitution provides that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force only on **British** ships whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth.

* Now, under those words, it does seem that Inter-State vessels whose first port of clearance is, say, Fremantle - take an 
And the laws of the Commonwealth shall be :'n force on all **British** ships.

* First of all, all the Queen's ships of war are excepted altogether, and then there is a further definition of **British** ships which are to be ships only, " whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth."

* On 31st July the Honorable  Mr. Philp,  Premier of Queensland, telegraphed to me as follows : - "It is usual custom for **British** New Guinea Government steamer  Merrie England  to receive annual overhaul and she is now in Brisbane for that purpose.

* Queensland and also with the* Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, on the question of the future of **British** New Guinea.

* This Bill reverses the principles of **British** common law, because there restraint of trade must be unreasonable.

* The very fact that the climate of **British** New Guinea is tropical is an argument for prohibition, because every one knows that a tropical climate is disastrous to those who are in the habit of using alcohol to any extent.

* Now that we have an opportunity to prohibit the use of alcohol in **British** New Guinea, we should avail ourselves of it.

* The Minister for Defence has referred to the want of knowledge as to the history of the Pacific cable, and, as I have found that a certain amount of ignorance prevails upon the subject, I propose to read a letter written by  Sir Horace  Tozer, the Agent-General of Queensland, published in the  **British** Australasian  of 11th July, 1903, in which he gives some particulars as to the history of the enterprise.

* We pointed out that "it was an alternative route to the East, passing entirely through territory under **British** control, that its importance from a strategical point of view was manifest, and the possession of the first cable across the Pacific was a matter of the highest  commercial importance."

* A very great' responsibility rests on our shoulders in regard to the 350,000 blacks in **British** New Guinea, and no means that we can take should be considered too stringent to insure the end which we have in view - which is, that they shall not be permitted to obtain intoxicating, liquor.

* There is a saving common sense in **British** communities which enables them to adjust their disputes fairly and honorably.

* We must realize that this loan, if floated, will not command anything like the price at which Canada can command money in the **British** market to-day.

* He said, for example, that the distribution of **British** or other imported goods in Australia would constitute an Australian industry, and as such would be protected from unfair competition under the clause.

* It could not then be objected that, those engaged in Australian industries would be allowed to combine and unfairly destroy an industry which took the shape of distributing **British** goods, whilst the distributors of such goods would not be permitted to combine to unfairly compete against Australian producers.

* According to the Attorney-General, the distribution -of **British** woollens in Australia would be an Australian industry, and under the clause competition, even unfair competition, which would affect only a portion of Australian industry, could not be interfered with.

* The distribution of **British** tweeds would form only a portion of the industry connected with the -distribution of woollen goods amongst us, and, according to the Attorney-General's reading of the clause, no measures could be taken to protect the distributors of **British** tweed against the distributors of Australian tweed, or  vice versa.

* But the Attorney-General has told us that the distribution of **British** goods here would become an Australian industry, and he has stated, further, that the clause does not deal with unfair competition which results in injury to one particular section of an Australian industry.

* The distribution of Australian tweeds would constitute only a section of that Australian industry, because the distribution of **British** tweeds - according to the AttorneyGeneral - would also form a portion of that industry.

* The distribution of tweeds, as the Attorney-General admitted, would be an Australian industry, irrespective of whether the goods distributed were of Australian or **British** origin.

* Let us look at the position from the other standpoint, namely, that under this provision we can penalize the distributor df **British** tweeds if he engages in unfair competition against his fellow distributor of Australian tweeds.

* If the honorable and learned gentleman takes up the other attitude, and 'if he states that the distributor of **British** tweeds can be penalized for unfair competition, then it is grossly unjust that the distributor of Australian tweeds engaged in similar competition with the object of injuring or destroying the other branch of the industry - the distribution of **British** tweeds - should go scot free.

* Now when I push home the argument, he reverts to the position which I maintained at first that the **British** distributor would be liable to unfair competition on the part of those distributing the Australian article, and that under this provision he would have no redress, although if he himself indulged in what a jury deemed to be unfair competition he would be liable not merely to heavy fines, but to twelve months' imprisonment.

* His  arguments against it are that he fears, first of all, that if the sale of alcohol in **British** New Guinea were prohibited, there would be a considerable loss of revenue - - 
When it suits the leader of the Opposition he describes Papua as a distant island which no one ever visits, but now he would have us believe that it is a place of call for thousands of people who require to replenish their stores of liquor.

* Some honorable member with a fair degree of mathematical skill has calculated the consumption of whisky, brandy, and gin per head per annum amongst the population of **British** New Guinea.

* I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he will cause to be laid on the table of this House copies of any despatch or other documents received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the subject of a proposed Imperial Conference of representatives of various parts of the Empire, with a view to establishing a Common Navigation and Merchant Shipping Law for the **British** nation; and whether the Government intend to take any action in the matter?

* If any honorable member will move to add to clause jj, which provides that the Act shall not be construed to apply to domestic servants or personal attendants accompanying their employers to Australia, the words, " or saving during a time of threatened  or actual industrial disputes to any white **British** subject," I shall support him.

* But before dealing with the prohibition question, I wish to referto the statement that the officials in **British** New Guinea have done their utmost to protect black labour.

* I would rather see every white man taken out of New Guinea to-morrow, and have the country left to the native races as it was before the **British** took possession, than send to them - as we are proposing to do now by means of this amendment of the Prime Minister - a curse in the form of liquor.

* Four **British** tenders were received in addition to one by Lysaght Bros.

* wirenetting the difference between the accepted **British** tender and that of Lysaght Brothers was not so great.

* Nothing in the Papua Act 1905 shall be deemed to prevent grants or dispositions of freehold estates in land within the Territory being made in pursuance of rights of purchase acquired under the law of **British** New Guinea before the commencement of that Act.

* I believe he even goes further and says that as a matter of general **British** law this jurisdiction may exist without it being specially conferred by Act of Parliament.

* As to the comparative rate of growth, the remarks of the honorable member for West Sydney reminded me of comparisons which I have heard re garding the relative increase in the **British** and other navies.

* It is not altogether due to that ; and in regard to his statement of the rigidity in **British** parties, I think there could be found recent examples of Honorable members crossing the floor on certain Bills in the House of Commons.

* In the advertising work that we undertake we shall put only the absolute facts regarding Australia before the **British** public.

* Of course, we are not responsible for (hem, but I can assure honorable members that, now that the State Governments have consented to the Commonwealth undertaking the general advertising of Australia, and now that we are to have a High Commissioner, we hope to be able to undertake more extensive advertising operations, and whatever we put before the **British** public will bear the impress of truth.

* That body passed a resolution inviting the whole of the trade unions and organizations of Australia to join in a representation to the **British** Labour Party in the House of Commons, as to the undesirability of sending any more immigrants to Australia.

* I have made inquiries into the question of the drink traffic in **British** New Guinea, and I admit that there will be some difficulty in preventing smuggling.

* One of the officials with whom I had an opportunity of conversing told me that it would be impossible, with such an extended coastline, and with such a small staff of officials as they -have in **British** New Guinea., to prevent the introduction of contraband spirits.

* The whole scheme was summed up very succinctly by a member of the **British** House of Commons, who is now travelling in Australia.

* The people of South Africa have also responded, not by increasing the duties against foreigners, but by decreasing the imposts upon **British** goods.

* There has been no talk of increasing duties against the foreigner as a means of diverting trade into **British** channels.

* It is proposed to build up a higher wall against the foreigner, but not to remove one brick to facilitate the introduction of **British** goods.

* We propose to divert trade into **British** channels to the extent of only : per cent.

* The point I wish to emphasize is that if we prohibit **British** steamship companies from employing men who, after all, are our fellowsubjects, we shall encourage the introduction of more and more Germans into our mercantile marine.

* Minister to offer a real preference to Great Britain by allowing the present duties to remain operative as against foreign goods, and by lowering those duties as against **British** goods.

* It merely means that year after year New Zealand will be in a better position to oust goods of **British** manufacture from that colony.

* It provides for the Marshall, Gilbert, and Ellice groups, where **British** and Australiantraders are exposed to the serious competition of a German' line of steamers.

* We had the advice of Captain Rason,  Mr. Woodford,  the Resident on the Solomon Islands, and other **British** officials, who,, quite apart from ' commercial considerations, could give us an independent judgment, and place their large knowledge at our disposal.

* India has a population of some 350,000,000 coloured1 **British** subjects, and I doubt if there are as many hundred thousand whites to be found there; but neither the white nor coloured races are allowed to exercise the franchise.

* Ltd.; Wotherspoon  v.  Currie; Johnston and Co.  v.  Orr, Ewing, and Co.;  all of which were cases which arose before the passing of the first **British** Trades Mark Registration Act in the year 1875.

* In the event of tho passage of the Imperial Naval Subsidy proposals, has he made any, and, ifso what, arrangement with the **British** Government as to its taking over the officers and men engaged in the State vessels?

* Although the Prime Minister declined to allow the 48th clause of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to be recommitted, on the ground that that course was unnecessary, he adopted a different attitude in regard to the Papua (**British** New .Guinea) Bill.

* Again, to take a more nearly, analogous case, **British** Columbia in the same year refused to join the Union until the Dominion Parliament had definitely undertaken to construct the Canadian-Pacific railway.

* In the great city of London, one person out of five dies in a lunatic asylum or other public institution, and yet the **British** nation votes 80,000,000 a year for war armament.

* at works in Footscray, suffered arsenical poisoning through working amongst iron  pyrites,  and also to a statement in the **British**  Lancet  that, in a certain trade in England, the average working life is only seven years, and that the women who work in it never, bear a child again - that those workmen and workwomen who wash themselves with water pre, as it were, pockmarked by the action of the acid.

* The objection to the proposal that Australia should provide  Dreadnoughts  for the Old Country was that it would prevent the creation of an Australian Navy to co-operate with the **British** Navy, and would be no part of the scheme which the supportersof an Australian Navy favour.

* I do not think that there is a single ship in the fighting line of the **British** Navy to-day which was there sixteen years ago; indeed, as a matter of fact, the developments in naval architecture are such that the tendency now is to place vessels on the scrap heap even earlier than formerly.

* We have had official intimation from a **British** Consul in the United States that there is one obvious means whereby the returns made to us, though correct so far as the transit companies are concerned, may be rendered practically useless.

* The **British** Consul showed, however, that after the implements had been placed on board the train, and had apparently been sealed up they were available at intermediate points.

* I understand that in all **British** communities it is recognised that the King on his Throne, as well as the humblest in the land, is subject to criticism.

* solemn legislative enactment to remove from workmen the disabilities which the Judges read into the law, the law has gone back, by those very decisions limiting the definition of " workman," to very much the same position as before, and the workers have lost the advantages that the **British** Parliament intended to give them.

* Though **British** trade with Canada since 1807 had increased 49 per cent., general imports had increased  02  per cent.

* The use of **British** cylinders would mean more in carriage, and would generally prove more expensive.

* Those who have opposed it seem to consider that we should rely ever on the **British** Navy, and that we are under no responsibility to provide for our own defence.

* So much stress having been laid upon the impregnability of Great Britain's position, and the certainty that the **British** Navy could sweep the seas of its foes, I have gone to the trouble to ascertain, from the data available, what the position of the navy is, and what is the financial strength of the country which supports it.

* That showed that the strain was being felt by the **British** taxpayer, and that the Government was compelled to relieve the tension.

* The facts which I have stated justify us in doing what we can for our self-defence, instead of relying solely on the **British** Navy.

* I have every respect for Great Britain; but the grand Old Country that mothered us, mothered the present population of the **British** Isles, who are not our patrons, but our peers.

* We are part of the Empire, but not the sons of the present **British** people.

* It is a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence with the people who practically constitute the **British** Empire to-day.

* We have to deal with matters of fact, and one of the facts, as I see them, is that those who practically control the movements of the **British** Empire, and are principally concerned in its defence, are interested, not so much because of love of us, as because of love 06 money.

* The right honorable member has asserted that the **British** taxpayer has to foot the bill for the navy, but that individual does it more or less unconsciously.

* We must do something better than the payment of a sum which is a mere bagatelle, as compared with the 32,000,000 required for the maintenance of the **British** Navy.

* It is the first line of defence, as we all admit; but the integrity of this Commonwealth is just as essential a factor in the protection and maintenance of **British** trade and **British** interests, as is the upkeep of the navy, so far as this section of the Empire is concerned.

* The **British** Navy is at present fully efficient ; but let us assume that its efficiency is by force of circumstances impaired in any way.

* Personally, I should be prepared to support the raising of as much as 10,000,000 to found one, so long as the sinking fund to liquidate the debt could be provided in a way that appealed to me as just and right, and provided also that we could arrive at some satisfactory arrangement with the **British** Admiralty as to the control of the ships.

* An utter dependency upon the **British** Navy is not to be tolerated bv a self-respecting community nor is it justifiable on the part of a country with such limitless natural resources as we have.

* **British** battles of late have been on land; and if ever the Old Country wants assistance it would most likely be in the shape of land forces.

* We have been told by the right honorable member for Swan that we are, as it were, in the ' position of a son in his father's house - that we are utterly dependent on the **British** Navy, and that all we have to do is to further finance that navy.

* He might, without comment, have arrived at the conclusion that he was not satisfied with the guilt of the defendant, and that, in accordance with the practice in **British** courts of justice, he should give him the benefit of the doubt, but that, having regard to the wording of the section of the Act under which the prosecution had been brought, he had no option but to convict.

* The honorable member, at all events, is willing that one of the best known principles of **British** justice - a principle that has come to be regarded as "sacred - should be disregarded in order that a conviction may be secured.

* I find no fault with legitimate efforts for their suppression, so long as these are founded on recognised principles of **British** justice.

* He said that the **British** halls of justice had never been polluted with the tar-smeared hoof of the politician.

* They know the law, and as lawabiding citizens, though they may at odd moments rail against it, they respect it, as every **British** citizen does.

* To reinstate an officer who has practically been kicked out of the **British** Army in South Africa, and returned to Australia practically in disgrace, is a very serious step, and the Government should exercise the greatest care in taking action, in that direction.

* I would use both voice and pen in making my wrongs known throughout the **British** Dominions.

* These rags were woven into the cloth which we buy as **British** tweed.

* A tariff, unless sufficiently high to check **British** and foreign imports, is, in the protective sense, inoperative, and, therefore, no aid to local industry.

* The best part of the blood of the **British** race comes from a stock emanating from the coldest countries in Europe.

* I bring under the notice of the Treasurer not a wild-cat experiment, or an absurd idea, or theory of the Labour Party, but an experiment which has been carried to a successful issue in a part of the **British** Empire.

* The propriety of dealing with public works in this way is creatinga great deal of attention in America, and I glory in the fact that the system was first tried under the **British** flag in a country which enjoyed home rule, and minted its own coinage.

* I entertain that anxiety not because I doubt the absolute impartiality of any possible Judge of the High Court, but because in dangers and difficulties which may come upon us, when the conditions of life are harder than' they are now, there may be some degree of apprehension as to the entanglement of that high and pure tribunal of a **British** community in the desperate struggles of large bodies of  His  Majesty's subjects.

* Theoretically this is one of the grossest invasions' of the ordinary rights of the individual and of the first principles of **British** justice which we can conceive.

* It is provided that a woman who, not being a **British** subject, marries a **British** subject, shall be naturalized.

* I am a little at a loss to interpret the cable message,' which gives only an abbreviated report of  Mr. Balfour's  speech, because at the Imperial Conference it was plainly intimated, even by **British** Ministers, that, having regard to their revenue necessities, they were not in a position to consider such reciprocal arrangements as we proposed, even though based upon a policy of free-trade throughout the Empire.

* When speakers, notably members of the **British**' Government, used the expression " tax '.'

* If he says that that is **British** law, I defy the Attorney-General 10 prove the statement.

* Can it be pretended that this is in accord with **British** law?

* A tender of payment of money, if made in coins which are **British** coins or Australian coins of current weight, shall be a legal tender - 
Provided that a tender of payment of money, if made in **British** coins other than gold coins, shall not be a legal tender for any amount after a date to be fixed by proclamation.

* I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Australian correspondent of the London  Times  was correct in informing that journal, on the 1  6th  August, that the Prime Minister had sent through him a message to **British** merchants and the supporters of preference on the subject of the Government's intention in reference to that policy?

* Will he explain the meaning of his statement to the **British** merchants that " the Government is determined to make preference effective," and state whether, in his opinion, it is in keeping with that determination that the Government proposed a preference equivalent to  16.2/3  n wire netting, which, under pressure, they changed to a preference equivalent to  '33.1/3  per cent., and finally voted for an amendment making it  50  per cent.

* It would be easily possible to call to mind a series of cases in the history of the old country which have marked turning points in the development of the **British** Constitution.

* The **British** Constitution differs from our own in character and essence, so far as an unwritten Constitution differs from a written Constitution ; but honorable members have only to glance for an instant at the law reports of the United States of America to see that, in the definition of the written Constitution of that country, the law courts have played so important a part that it would be possible to write a complete history of the United States, and to record every one of its developments from such reports alone.

* What I was alluding to was this : that exemption certificates are not generally used in connexion with **British** subjects.

* I- disagree with the honorable member for Bourke in the view that our naval defence is merely the defence of commerce in the restricted sense ' of the protection given to ships in mid-ocean which are carrying goods between other parts of the **British** Dominions and Australia.

* I should also like to direct attention to the parallel which it seeks to establish between the treatment which is meted out to **British** subjects and that which is accorded to Chinamen.

* We talk largely of our Empire, but we are favouring, not the **British** ship-owners but the foreigner.

* Trouble also arose in connexion with two other ships, the  Ivedene  and  Heathdene,  which were under **British** articles.

* The Constitution with which we propose to endow **British** New Guinea is similar to that which all of the Australian States had at their foundation.

* Considering that there are only about 250 **British** white subjects in New Guinea, I fail to understand why there should be any desire to introduce the elective system at this early stage in its career, and I do not think that' it is necessary in the interest of the native population to do so.

* Many of the men whom we sent to South Africa in the defence of the Empire came from our country districts, and proved to be some of the most useful soldiers at the disposal of the **British** officers.

* The right honorable gentleman knows that in a communication which he recently received in reference to the way in which the differenttroops from Australia performed their' work in South Africa, the **British** officers highly commended our forces.

* Amongst the advantages that were prominently brought before the people as likely to follow from the federation of the States was the fact that instead of speaking as several disunited States upon matters of vast importance such as this, we should be able to make our influence felt as a united people ; but at the very first stage of our national existence, instead of  approaching   the **British** Government with firmness and determination, and straightforwardly and honestly putting before them the wishes of the Australian people, the Government propose in this Bill that we should speak with fear and trembling.- The whole of the actions of the **British** Government in connexion with the Australian colonies have been of a character which should have inspired us with every confidence, and have deprived us of all.

* "When the federation of Australia was first placed before the Imperial Government they hailed with delight the advent of a new nation growing up under the **British** Grown, and everything that lias been done by the **British** Government in connexion with the birth of the Commonwealth should have induced us to regard them with feelings quite opposite to those which now seem to animate the Government.

* I believe with the honorable member who last spoke that the **British** people think more of us Australians, and of our friendship and kinship, than they think of the Japanese or any other people ; and this House will be recreant to its trust, and to its pledges to carry out the wishes of the Australian people, if we do not let the **British** Government know what is the  true  feeling of the Commonwealth on this subject.

* I maintain that in a country like New South Wales it is our duty to preserve the type of the **British** nation, and that we ought not, for any consideration whatever, to admit any element that would detract from, or in any appreciable degree lower, that admirable type of nationality.

* That is the usual form of a debenture, and in all **British** communities such a debenture is equivalent to a first mortgage on the undertakings.

* When  Sir William  Macgregor held office as Administrator of **British** New Guinea, he recommended the policy of making grants of land to religious bodies, and told the missionaries to plant their lands with cocoanuts in order that they might in that way secure a certain amount of revenue to carry on their work.

* My idea was that **British** New Guinea could be made a large copra-producing country.

* Government decides to add a battleship to the **British** Navy as a gift from Australia, these banks will be prepared to provide in London, as an advance to the Government of the Commonwealth, the necessary funds either in one sum for the purchase, or in instalments for the building as may be required ; such advance would be repayable, at the convenience, of the Government, in London, within, say, six months after the close of the next session of the Commonwealth Parliament, and' would carry interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly.

* I have the honour to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of your letter of the 23rd inst., intimating that if the Commonwealth Government decided to add a battleship to the **British** Navy as a gift from Australia, the Bank of New South Wales and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney will be prepared to provide in London, as an advance to the Government of the Commonwealth, the necessary funds, to carry interest at 3 per cent.

* Asto the financial conditions of the territory, if honorable members will look at clause 46, they will find that it turns into an enactment the second part of a resolution passed by this Parliament two years ago, granting- 20,000 a year for a period of five yearsfor the administration of **British** New Guinea.

* I believe that they are trying to do something, but I do not think that the management of the German territory has been as successful as that of the **British** territory.

* In connexion with that matter clause 38 provides that no ordinance authorizing the purchase of land by private persons, except from the LieutenantGovernor, or from purchasers from him or from the Administrator of the Possession of **British** New Guinea shall come into operation until the Governor-General has signified his pleasure regarding it.

* It is provided also that the Administrator may give notice that lands are open to applications for purchase in any part of the possession, the land to be specified in the notice, which is to be published in the **British** New Guinea  Gazette,  the London  Gazette,  and the official  Gazette  of each of the colonies and New Zealand.

* From an advertisement published in the **British** New Guinea  Government Gazette,  of 2nd December, 1899, I find that certain freehold and leasehold lands were announced for sale.

* If honorable members knew how the Germans carried on their trade, they would be aware that a quantity of material has been imported into England, and re-exported to Australia as **British** goods.

* They cannot, therefore, be exported from England as being the product of **British** labour.

* It is quite clear that it was intended by the Convention, and also that the practice of the **British** and State Parliaments has uniformly been that the House of Representatives, the Lower House or popular branch of the Legislature, should have this control.

* And, since I agree with those who contend that this amendment does increase the burdens of the people, therefore the balance of reasoning being, as I think, in favour of the rights of this House, there must be some very good and sufficient reason shown why we should depart from the practice of **British** Parliaments.

* Mr. WEBSTER (Gwydir).- The course of events during the last hour is in my opinion unparalleled in the history of **British** Parliaments.

* I do not think that in any **British** Parliament any such power is relegated to the  Chairman  of Committees as that which has been exercised to-night.

* Under the old **British** law monopolies which were detrimental to the public were hit at.

* Injury to the public is a term well known to **British** law.

* Now, legislation of this kind, as far as
            the **British** colonies are concerned, began, as honorable members are well aware, in
            Natal, and if honorable members will compare the provisions of the Natal Act, as I read
            them, with the provisions in the first sub-clause of clause 4, they will see the extent
            of the difference between that Act and the Bill now before them.

* The provision in the
            Natal Act, corresponding to that in subclause (a) of clause 4, reads as follows : - 
Any person who, when asked to do so, fails to write out, in the characters of any
              language of Europe, a passage 'in English of fifty words in length, taken by the
              officer from a **British** author, and append his name in his own language.

* The New South Wales Act of1899 describes a prohibited immigrant as
            " a person other than of **British** birth or parentage, who when asked,&amp;c., shall
            fail to write out in any European language " - of which a form is given in the
            schedule, although it may be changed as is provided for a certain number of words.

* Subject to any objection which may arise on the ground of international
                comity, it is firmly established by the well-known case of Musgrove and Chun Teong
                Toy - if it needed to be established - that there is a right on the part of
                governments and powers as between each other - and the whole of the **British** Empire
                is looked upon by foreign nations as one power - to exclude such persons from their
                territory as seemto them undesirable.

* Any attempt to impose disqualifications on the basis of such distinctions,
              besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of
              equality which have been the guiding principle of **British** rule throughout the Empire.

* As you are already aware, this company employs none but- **British** workmen in its manufactures, and having a large vested interest throughout the Commonwealth, is, we.

* He declared that **British** manufacturers did not contemplate losing the Australian trade.

* It has been held by that Court that in such circumstances the breaking of the Federal Customs seals on board a **British** vessel is an infringment of the law, and renders the master of the vessel liable to be fined.

* In the one case it was held that the Commonwealth had power practically to fine a person who was not a **British** subject for a breach of the Commonwealth laws, while in the other it was held that a fine could be inflicted upon a man who, while being a **British** subject, was not domiciled here.

* I have before me a copy of the  **British** Printer,  which contains a list of wages paid to compositors in some of the cities in England.

* The fact that the proprietors of these directories use the low wages and long hours of **British** printers as a lever ought to be a sufficient reason to induce us to make the duty 6d.

* The expenditure in connexion with the administration of affairs in **British** New Guinea has been entirely under the control of officials, and I find that although the annual expenditure has amounted to between 38,000 and 39,000, only about 2,000 has been spent on public works, nearly all the rest having been absorbed by the payment of salaries.

* That the following sub-clause be inserted after sub-clause (2) :  - "(2a) The non-official members shall be three in numberuntil the resident white **British** population totals One thousand, and one additional representative shall be added for each additional One thousand of such population.

* There isno direct attempt here to injure any oneconnected with any portion of the **British** Empire, but we have to see that Australia - a vast and rich continent, possessing somuch raw material - shall not remain in the slough in which she is, but shall prosper much more rapidly than she has done in production and manufacture.

* A **British** firm, too, is entering into a large contract for the supply of certain articles which are being made in Japan, but sent here as if made in Great Britain.

* Mr. Whitelaw  had been charged by  Mr. Hartnoll  with being a pro-Boer, and following that up, the right honorable gentleman said, as he has said here, that he knew of one instance where  Mr. Whitelaw  had made some statement, in connexion with the war, antagonistic to the **British** side, and then he remarked that he would sooner see a pro-Boer hung than returned to Parliament.

* With regard to the alleged  pro-Boerism  of  Mr. Whitelaw,  I desire to say - in case any false ideas should get abroad - that  Mr. Whitelaw  volunteered with his son to go to the Transvaal, and fight for the **British**.

* I cannot understand thegrounds that can be advanced in justification for putting a foreign trading vessel on a better footing than a **British** vessel ; norcan I understand why the limitation is somuch greater, andthe power assumed is somuch less in this particular Bill than that, assumed in similar legislation which hasbeen passed elsewhere.

* In New Zealand the legislation extends to over-sea shipping, irrespective of whether it be **British** or foreign, so long as the vessels trade between the ports of that country.

* There is no part of my public career to which I look back with so much pleasure as the time when my Government were enabled to render assistance to the **British** Government.

* Above all, we should not forget that our safety depends on the prestige of the **British** flag.

* That bloodshed would have been averted if a firmer policy had been pursued at the beginning, and it was the same want of firmness after Majuba Hill which resulted in the conclusion of peace, immediately following the signal defeat of a portion of the **British** army, that encouraged the Boers to take a course that has proved their own destruction.

* In asking for this contingent, the **British** Government may have been actuated by a desire to save the reputation of Australia itself in the eyes of the civilized world, because it would have been a reflection on Australia if we were to have held back when Great Britain was engaged, so near our own shores, in a war in which we could render such material aid.

* This is one of those cases where  Mr. Morgan,  the representative of the **British** Manufacturers' Association, intimated that duties of 15 and 10 per cent.

* So long as we are a part of the **British** Empire no nation can attack Australia without also attacking Great Britain.

* So should I. I have heard it stated that the **British** Empire pays away 800,000,000 annually in hard cash for its imports.

* I notice that the UnderSecretary of State for the Colonies,  -Mr. Winston  Churchill, at a Western Australian dinner in London the other day  declared himself in  favour  of preference as between the dependencies of the **British** Empire.

* I notice that under present conditions Australian trade with **British** Possessions has a tendency to increase, and under a system of intercolonial reciprocity, such as is suggested by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, that movement would certainly be accelerated.

* He speaks of the Italian residents of Malta electing non-official members to the Legislative Council there, in opposition to the **British** race.

* As the white population of **British** New Guinea is so numerically small, I am of opinion that it would be better to pass the Bill in its present form.

* The cry of "Australia for the Australians " means the exclusion of **British** people as well as of other white races.

* .- There appears in this division the item " Expenses incurred by **British** Consul, Chicago, advertising Australia, 150."

* On the one hand we have the Standard Oil Trust, and on the other the **British** Imperial Company, which approaches us under the specious pretence that it is a **British** Trust, and ought, therefore, to be encouraged.

* Recently we noticed that, whilst Natal was ready enough to embarrass the **British** Government, she was only too anxious to fall back upon Great Britain for her defence.

* We ought either to be ready to accept the tutelage ofthe **British** Government, or we ought to be prepared to shoulder our responsibility for having given umbrage to nations like Japan - by reason of our White Australia policy - by defending our action through the taxation of our own people and by the force of our own arms.

* The colonial jams have therefore, in free competition, driven the **British** and foreign products out of the Western Australian market.

* I wish to call the attention of honorable members to the **British** practice in regard to the choice of a Speaker, and to contrast it with what happened yesterday, when the Prime Minister presided over a party caucus to decide who should be nominated.

* In a statement of what took place in  1874,  Todd, in volume I. of his  Parliamentary Government in England,  says - 
That is the **British** practice.

* At page  78,  volume 1., of Pellew's  Life of Lord Sidmouth,  we learn how careful Ministers were not to suggest that they were behind any particular individual - 
For over one hundred years, **British** Ministers have refused to let it be thought that they were trying to influence the election) of a  Speaker.

* Thus,  May  lays it down that in the **British** House of Commons the administration of the expenditure sanctioned by the Civil Service Estimates cannot be debated, whereas you, sir, propose to allow a debate upon the question of administration, and to exclude discussion upon questions of policy to which the extract quoted from  May  makes no reference.

* Then, again,  May  acknowledges that in the case of some Estimates an exception has been made in the **British** Parliament, and that, by established usage, the Minister in charge of the Army or Navy Estimates may make a general statement concerning the services for the year upon the first votes that are proposed to theCommittee, and a general discussion upon the Army and Navy services is taken thereon.

* It would be a serious departure from the procedure which has been established here if effect were given to your ruling, which is not in accordance with the practice laid down in  May,  inasmuch as you, sir, are prepared to allow a discussion to take place upon administration - a discussion which is not allowed in the **British** Parliament.

* It is also undesirable that no provision should be made that only Australian and **British** seamen shall be em p loved.

* I think that the Prime = Minister might very fairly imitate that example, and say that none but Australian or **British** seamen shall be empoyed on these mail boats.

* I am also certain that the majority would be overwhelming in upholding the determination of the **British** Government for the permanent retention of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal as part of **British** territory for all future time.

* The words uttered by the Prime Minister this afternoon, when he expressed the hope that his sons and his son's sons for all time would be members of the Australian Commonwealth, still associated by wholesome and natural ties to the **British** Empire, constitute a sufficient reply to that assertion.

* I hold that in this time - a blessed one, I think - we are in duty bound to respect the responsibilities which Australia has naturally upon her shoulders in association with the **British** Empire.

* If we are to go on peacefully, and to have no soldiering in this country or elsewhere, why do we not ask the **British** authorities to remove their ships of war from Austral-Pacific waters  1  They have been here for years and years.

* Almost since the inception of settlement in Australia, the **British** navy has been represented here by one or more war vessels protecting our interests, giving confidence to the settlers, and assisting in maintaining government.

* We must not stand alone, if we are to partake of the benefits and the protection of the **British** men-of-war around the coast of Australia.

* I am not so anxious that it should go to the **British** speaking people as that it should reach that part of the world in which the utterances have been made.

* When the honorable member for Hindmarsh saysthat there is no justification for a measure like this, he surely must be somewhat oblivious of events that have taken place during the last two or three years, and of the relationships now existing between the **British** Empire arid Japan.

* The people of this country believe that our Constitution was framed in a spirit of lovaltv to the **British** throne, and if a statement of that kind is accepted by the party to whom the honorable senator belongs, it should be indorsed by them.

* He has fought under the **British** flag, and, if necessary, would do so again.

* We have had "handed over to us by the **British** Government, as has been pointed out before, the power to govern ourselves, to control our own affairs within the four corners of the Constitution ; and, so far as this .particular matter is concerned, it is contained within the Constitution and has been handed over for our control 'and direction.

* In view of the attitude hitherto taken up by the Government of India with respect to shipments of coolies even to **British** possessions, I feel assured that, in the event of delay taking place between the passing, of the Bill here and its acceptance by the Home authorities, representations by this Government to the Government of India would be quite sufficient to prevent any contract being legalized in that country for the employment of coolies.

* The Government of India have not only discouraged the engagement of coolies for  Fiji  and **British** New Guinea plantations, but they have surrounded their engagement with restrictions of which the planters in those places complain very bitterly.

* I have just made the suggestion to the Prime Minister that he should make representations through the **British** Government to the Indian Office.

* I would urge upon the Prime Minister that he should not too readily accept the assertion that all these coloured people are **British** subjects.

* While I shall object to the appointment of highlypaid officials in connexion with our forces, 1 shall be prepared to give every encouragement to our young men to join volunteer and  partially-paid  regiments, because I recognise that, while we need not proclaim ourselves as a fighting nation, we have our responsibilities as part of the **British** Empire, and, as Australians, must prepare to defend our hearths and homes.

* We have to remember that **British** steamers are now obliged to fight against vessels subsidized by the Governments of France and Germany, and when we are considering arrangements with a view to increasing our trade, we should take into account the desirability of sustaining our own people against their competitors.

* In Western Australia a large amount of **British** capital is invested, and its business with Great Britain is proportionately greater than that of any other State.

* I have received information which I have not vet had an opportunity to verify, to the effect that a certain quantity of strawboard is manufactured in the United Kingdom, but that there are no imports from that country into Australia; because it is said, that the freights on such goods from Germany to Australia are infinitely cheaper than are those from England to Australia, and that this absolutely prohibits **British** competition.

* If this be true, it shows that the proposed preference would be of no benefit to the **British** manufacturers.

* To make it effective, we should either grant a very substantial reduction of the duty in favour of the **British** strawboard, or remove the impost altogether.

* An arrangement had been made with the **British** Admiralty for the use of part of the original, block, and, I ' think, that an arrangement had also been made with Messrs. Birt and Co. for the use .

* so-called local manufacturers import bulk blue from Reckitt's and other **British** makers, and after putting it through a slight treatment - which is really a process of adulteration - sell it as their own product.

* It will thus be seen that the proposed duty would simply be another tax, almost wholly upon **British** manufacture.

* The Government, which professes to be so greatly in favour- of extending a preference to goods from the United Kingdom, is actually proposing to levy a prohibitive duty upon **British** blue.

* per head to the people of this country ; but the **British** nation has always shown that, although charged with being a nation of shopkeepers, when need arose, its national ideals were as high as those of any nation in the world.

* The King of the greatest Empire the world has ever seen is to be crowned monarch, not of England, but of the whole **British** people.

* Foreign nations look on England with envy and admiration in connexion with **British** colonization.

* What the **British** people call the " Golden South " must not be represented meanly.We must not go to our first great festival as an old, shrivelled, broken-down, flat-chested woman, but as a bounding, bouncing maiden, full of hope and happiness, and certain of her destiny.

* I am informed by a missionary that it is the unanimous wish of the missionaries in **British** New Guinea that the sale of intoxicating drink to the natives should be entirely prohibited.

* They should be eschewed by healthy persons that wish to remain healthy in the climate of **British** New Guinea.

* Strategically, Sydney, as the naval base of the **British** fleet in these waters, is the most important port in the Commonwealth.

* Before the command of the sea can be gained and the enemy's fleets can be penned up in their own harbors, 'hostile vessels will no doubt roam at large - I do not think they will roam long - and their object will be, whilst avoiding the **British** squadrons, to do as much damage as thev can to our commerce, and our strategical centres.

* On this point, I should like to quote the authority of the **British** Empire on garrison defence, namely,  Garrison Artillery Training for 1Q04,  volume II.

* This authority lays it down that the class of vessels likely to be used in such raids as I have mentioned are - 
As briefly indicated in section II.,' the form of attack to which the ports of the **British** Empire are most liable is raid by torpedo boats, with the object of destroying shipping or docks within the defences.

* Therefore I say that, on the best authority in the **British** Empire, -our principal naval base is at the mercy of the first raider who pays it a visit.

* The maintenance of **British** supremacy at sea is the first condition of the security of Australian territory and trade in war.

* As such attacks reveal the position of the raiding vessels to the **British** ships, whose duty it is to bring them to action, they must necessarily be of a hasty and fugitive character.

* I think that it was by an Act passed in 1869 that the **British** Government acquired power to take over the privately-owned telegraph lines of the Kingdom; but the honorable member quite forgot to mention that up to a short time previously, the old semaphore, or hand system, had been used, notwithstanding that private companies had done much to improve the telegraphic system since its introduction, by Cooke and Wheatstone, about 1837.

* Notwithstanding these facts, the control of the telegraphic service by the **British** Government has not been an unmixed success.

* In addition to a natural protection, which ranges from 107 per .cent, to 204 per cent., the Committee has imposed a duty of 25 per cent - on foreign importations, and it is now proposed to make the duty on **British** importations 20 per cent.

* .- Some honorable members seem to think that Australia represents the Empire, and that we could imitate the example of France and Germany, by insisting that **British** vessels shall be manned by **British** seamen.

* We are only a portion of the Empire, and we cannot expect to exert any material influence upon the conditions which control **British** shopping.

* An exporter desiring to secure the preference would look about for a ship manned by a **British** crew.

* .-I know of no necessity for the proposed increase of duty on this item, but if the increase is agreed to, there should still be a preference afforded to **British** imports.I therefore move- 
That would give a preference of 5 per cent.

* I thinkwe might very well give **British** imports this small amount of preference.

* The **British** Fleet in Australian waters visits Jervis Bay very frequently to practise gunnery.

* I  have no hesitation in saying that just as New South Wales has given the **British** Fleet in our waters every facilitv tobuild al necessary works, docks, &amp;c. for the repair of its ships in Sydney Harbor, so she would be willing to afford the Commonwealth every opportunity and convenience, and possibly to set aside portion of the harbor for naval purposes.

* The **British** Empire to-day is dependent wholly for its continued existence upon .

* I have before me a copy of the report of the **British** Steam-ship Subsidies Committee.

* Another committee on the manning of **British** ships sat in 1896 under the presidency of the Right Honorable A. J. Mundella, President' of the  Board of Trade.

* Both of those committees pointed out the alarming decrease in the number of **British** seamen and the causes to which this decrease might be attributed.

* In the report on the manning of **British** ships, it is pointed out that 47 per cent, of the seamen employed, in the **British** mercantile marine are foreign, consisting either of lascars or of foreign white seamen.

* There are, of course, engaged in the coastal trade of Great Britain a much smaller proportion of foreign sailors; but in the ocean trade there are 47 per cent, of aliens amongst the crews of **British** vessels.

* **British** seamen are becoming noticeably fewer and fewer.

* Much is said with regard to re- lieving the competition to which the chief **British** shipping companies are exposed,  but nothing whatever is proposed with a view to remedy the most cruel and onesided competition to which the **British** seamen is subjected.

* I for one can derive no consolation from the fact that a ship flies the **British** flag whilst her crew consists principally of aliens.

* Beresford, and the members of the Navy League - who may be considered to be experts upon this subject, and to have the best interests of the Empire at heart - say unreservedly that unless something is done to encourage **British** seamen the mercantile marine, as a nursery for **British** seamen, will become extinct.

* We seek by these clauses to avoid the condition of things which is unhappily existing in the **British** mercantile marine, and we are endeavouring to build- up on the coast of Australia a mercantile marine which will be manned by Australian seamen, who may in times of difficulty and distress be of some service to the Commonwealth.

* The bulk of the seamen of Australia are **British**, not Scandinavians.

* I know what I am speaking of when I say that the bulk of the men in the Australian coasting trade are **British**, not Scandinavians - and when I say Scandinavians I include all persons who are not **British**.

* I should say that at least 70 per cent, of those engaged in the coastal trade of Australia are **British**.

* I may point out that many **British** ships that come to our ports have hardly a **British** citizen aboard.

* Without going into the matter at great length, it appears to me that it is highly desirable that the seamen manning Australian vessels should be **British**, and that every effort should be made by us to bring about that result.

* I would point out one case to show that the honorable and learned member was entirely ignorant of the facts when he declared that the section of the Customs Act, which imposes a fine for the breaking of seals outside the territorial waters, is a class of legislation unknown in the **British** Empire.

* the simple reason that **British** ships will be given a preference.

* We propose to allow **British** ships to trade on our coasts on precisely the same terms as are imposed on Australian vessels, and to exclude from the coastal trade of Australia all foreign subsidized vessels.

* **British** vessels are unfairly handicapped where they have to compete against these foreign subsidized vessels, and in the evidence taken by a Select Committee of the House of 
Commons upon steam-ship subsidies, bitter complaints are made by **British** steam-ship owners about the unfair competition to which I refer.

* The Government, therefore, propose, if the clauses now before the Committee are agreed to, to prevent foreign subsidized vessels from competing in the Australian coastal trade with **British** and Australian vessels.

* But **British** vessels will be permitted to do so if their owners pay the same rates of wages, and are subject to the same conditions, as apply to the owners of Australian vessels.

* We propose to giv: **British** vessels the same rights as are given to Australian vessels, if the same wages are paid to the men on board them as are paid to the crews of the Australian vessels, and to exclude foreign subsidized vessels from the benefits of the measure by refusing them permission to engage in the Australian coastal trade under any circumstances, so long as they are subsidized.

* No doubt the consequences would be that **British** subjects would suffer retaliation at the hands of Continental nations.

* I venture to say that if we state honestly and directly what we want, the **British** Government will stand by us and assist us in bringing about the end we have in view.

* Mention has already been made by one or two honorable members of the fact that in the **British** Isles there are quite a large number of people who could not possibly pass this educational test.

* I will quote one more authority, not a **British** writer, but one belonging to the United States.

* There is a time, as it would be with me, when, if efforts were made to practically take away my reputation without justification, my **British** blood could stand no more; and I should have no hesitation, if the man were worthy of it, in making myself a sacrifice in order to show the people the curse that is amongst us.

* Any average between these two extremes can be obtained by a selection of articles upon which varying rates of duty have to be paid- I have never attached any value to the 7 per cent, calculation, except that placed upon it by the **British** Board of Trade, which made it, viz., as showing the average duty paid upon the products named in the return.

* The value of the return lay in the fact that the Board of Trade considered that the articles named represented the principal **British** exports.

* I may inform honorable members that in Canada the duty upon wire netting of **British** origin is 20 per cent., the intermediate duty - which is a sort of semipreferential duty - is 27 per cent., and the duty under the general Tariff is 30 per cent.

* The rates, proposed- 15 per cent, against foreigners, and 10 per cent, against **British** manufacturers - are not too high, and will not bring about any material increase of' price in the local article.

* When the debate' was adjourned last evening, I was referring to the evidence of three **British** Admirals, who sustained the view that in certain conditions the colonies would be justified in establishing local navies for special local service.

* Another **British** Admiral who may be quoted in support of that view is Admiral Fremantle, a distinguished naval officer of England, who, in an article published in the  United Service Magazine  a few months ago upon this question, uses the following sentences : - 
These three **British** admirals may be cited in support of the principle contended for by various public writers and members of this Parliament.

* Hordern, of the **British** navy, and yet he has admitted in an article published in the  United Service Magazine  that, under certain circumstances, the local naval forces might be utilized for the purpose of dealing with emergencies which would inevitably arise during the course of a naval war.

* He says - 
The sea is all one, and therefore the **British** fleet should be all one.

* In the same way, although the **British** fleet may be all one, there are divisions of the fleet, the various divisions being assigned to different quarters of the globe.

* _ May I remind honorable members of the fact that the **British** Isles have always had a special force assigned for their protection and defence.

* What would the people of England think of any person who suggested that, for purposes of concentration of naval force in any part of the world, the shores of Great Britain should be left unguarded for a single moment  1 
Later on, he urges the provision of a North Sea fleet always cruising in **British** waters.

* That additional station will be a further source of defence for the **British** Isles, and its ' establishment shows that the Admiralty recognise that there are certain positions which require to be permanently watched, and which should not be interfered with by any demand for concentration of fleets in any other part of the globe.

* I believe that the statesmen and people of England will think just as much of us as citizens of the Empire if we plainly set forth our views on this subject and tell them how we wish to discharge our obligations, as if we blindly vote a subsidy of 200,000 to the **British** Admiralty.

* On the other hand, there is a desire to keep **British** justice and Australian justice up to the high standard which it has hitherto maintained, and from which it would not be to the interests of the community to allow it to fall.

* Yes ; **British** subjects would not come directly under this clause, but a subject of Japan - an Empire with which Great Britain has entered into an alliance - would be affected by it, and the natives of the independent States of India which are not under the Empire would also be involved.

* The 16th section of the Imperial Naturalization Act of 1870 reads as follows :  - 
All laws, statutes, and ordinances which may be duly made by the Legislature of any **British** possession for imparting to any person the privileges, or any of the privileges, of naturalization, to be enjoyed by such person within the limits of such possession, shall within such limits have the authority of law, but shall be subject to be confirmed or disallowed by Her Majesty in the same manner and subject to thesame rales in and subject to which Her Majesty has power to confirm or disallow any other laws, statutes, or ordinances in that possession.

* According to the  Canadian Year Book,  the production of pig-iron in the **British** Isles in 1899 was 10,000,000 tons, and in America 15,000,000 tons.

* If 8,000 is anything like a reasonable estimate of the cost of a trawler, it seems to me that it would be better, instead of paying 12,000 to get one made in Australia, to purchase a suitable vessel in England, Scotland, or some other part of the **British** dominions.

* The article proceeds to remind Australia that it is impossible for the **British** navy to be maintained strong at all points unless it receives greater support from the states of the empire.

* I am prepared to allow any **British** subject to enter Australia, so long as he subscribes to conditions similar to those which obtain here.

* I find that  Sir Henry  Parkes took to himself considerable credit for introducing, on the 24th November, 1887, a Bill embodying the substance of an agreement entered into between the Australian and **British** authorities with reference to the maintenance of a squadron on the Australian station.

* of that agreement reads as follows : - 
If we admit the principle that we ought to contribute to the **British** Navy for defence purposes, I am of opinion that 200,000 is not sufficient.

* That is a very proper provision, but it should not apply to **British** workmen 'brought here under agreement stipulating that they must receive the highest prevailing rate of wages and be paid overtime.

* Altogether, contrary to the terms of the Naval Agreement, there are 570 **British**  seamen on these vessels whose places ought to be filled by Australians.

* As I have already had occasion to point out, the question at issue is whether duties of Customs shall be reduced in respect to goods of **British** manufacture imported in **British** ships.

* These goods will come into competition with other goods of **British** manufacture imported in foreign ships, as well as with foreign goods imported in foreign ships.

* A distinction is made against the last in favour of the first, but if this amendment is carried, the difficulties of merchants and traders will be increased very considerably by the creation of a distinction between **British** ships manned by not less than 80 per cent.

* of white **British** seamen and other **British** vessels.

* Any recommendation made by that Conference, if embodied in the Merchant Shipping Act, will apply to all **British** ships and seamen, and will have my sympathy and support.

* - The people and Government of the mother country gratefully appreciate the patriotic and sympathetic terms of  the  resolutions passed by the House of Representatives, and they welcome this public repudiation by the Commonwealth of Australia of the calumnious charges which have been brought against **British** soldiers, and - 
I do not wish to add fuel to a fire, but there has been placed in my hands a Berlin publication entitled the  BloodyBook of the Transvaal,  with 24 illustrations, by some artist named JeanVeber.

* One depicts the " Glorious Britannia," as she is called, in the flames of hell, amidst the torments and jeers of the damned, with  Mrs. Kruger  amongst the angels deploring Britannia's fate; while the other depicts the General in command of the **British** forces in South Africa in a most devilishly suspicious attitude.

* can only say that the patience' being exhibited here is that which has been exhibited in the **British** House of- Commons, and in the House of Representatives of America, for many years.

* **British** Government during the last four years,showing why a Select Committee could not be accepted by the Government, and would not be satisfactory to the people, of Great Britain.

* However, let me proceed with the speech of the representative of the **British** PostmasterGeneral 
No doubt that is true.

* was contemplated by the Federal Convention that such an officer would be appointed to voice in a distinct way the feelings and aspirations of Australia before the great nations of the world, and particularly in connexion with our relations to the **British** Government.

* We have interests in the South 
If, as the honorable member suggests, the people of France are content, because of a sense of patriotism, to smoke inferior tobacco, that is no reason why a **British** community should be so foolish as to place men in charge of the State manufacture of tobacco who would  not give them the very best they could obtain for the money.

* to **British** Columbia.

* Is it a fact that goods of **British** manufacture being passed through the Customs Department are charged at the rates specified for those of foreign goods ; if so, on what authority ?

* - Provided further that until the Railways of the State of Western Australia areconnected with the Railways of the State of South Australia, the carrying of passengers between a port in Western Australia and any other port in Australia By any **British** ship ordinarily carrying mails to or from the Commonwealth shall not be deemed engaging in the coasting trade.

* - If the Governor-General is satisfied that any **British** ship not registered in Australia trades or intends to trade between places on the west, north-west, and north coast of Australia, between Fremantle and Cape York, and that it is desirable in the interests of those places, or any one of them, for the ship so to trade, he may, by order, exempt the ship from all or any of the provisionsof this Part of this Act, either unconditionally  or  subject to such conditions as he thinks fit to impose, for any period not exceeding three years?

* I hope, however, that that country will yet see its way to accept the idea that the **British** navy should be used for the general protection of the Empire.

* Writing at the time of the Behring Sea disputes, he said - 
I differ from the view taken by the honorable member, because I think that there should be no obstacle to fair Competition between **British** subjects.

* - Spirit casks left empty after any operation, whether they have contained **British** spirits or foreign spirits, are, as a rule, to be refilled.

* Casks of **British** liqueurs, such as orange bitters, of which the strength is under 42 per cent., may be delivered when emptied without the grogging regulations being applied to them.

* We protested against the terms of the dual control, and recently, on hearing that the French Government had appointed a representative, and that the **British** Government had not made a similar appointment, cabied tothe Colonial Office, pointing out that **British** settlers were under disability by reason of the activity of the French official and the absence of a **British** representative.. A reply was received about six weeks ago that the **British** appointment would be made as soon as possible.

* As to the truth of that statement I' have no knowledge, but if, on inquiry, it proves correct, "I shall again communicate with the **British** Government, which has chosen this form of administration, but, for reasons which may be good, though unknown to us,has not exercised the powers it possesses under the joint agreement.

* Only last week there was a riot in a northern town - in Leonora, I think - between **British** and Italian workers.

* Was there ever a time in the history of the **British** nation when men who were willing to give their services for the defence of their country were refused an opportunity to fit themselves to do so?

* Such a state of affairs never existed in the **British** Empire, and I hope that we are not going to bring it about here.

* I want the High Commissioner to be put in the same position as an ambassador, because the time is coming when all the **British** dependencies will become separate nations within the Empire.

* It is bad enough in ordinary circumstances to suppose a man guilty, but when we presume a man to be guilty, and do not allow him to disprove his guilt, we do that which is contrary to our instincts of **British** fair play.

* We ought to apply the old rule of **British** justice, and' afford an opportunity to a master to show that he has done his best to carry out the provisions of the law, and that only anhonest mistake has been made.

* Public opinion there is ripening rapidly in favour of the employment ofonly **British** white seamen on our mail boats, in order that we may keep the **British** marine as a part of the **British** nation.

* Then, again, the exports of **British** produce in the three years 1860-2 inclusive represented 384,000,000, which in the years 1880-2 -had increased to 698,000,000, while for the years 190.0-2 the total was 831,000,000.

* We are asked to protect **British**- goods against pauper-made goods : that is, goods made in countries where protection has been the 'policy for years.

* The **British** post-office is conducted upon commercial principles.

* That is a matter for the **British** taxpayer to decide, though I have not the slightest doubt that - following the example of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in reference to the question of Home Rule - the honorable member for Yarra will be prepared to submit a motion to this Houseinviting it to remonstrate with the Imperial authorities upon the way in which they administer their Postal Department.

* The evidence shows that we are only at the beginning of an era of foreign competition, that that competition is certain to become more and more severe, and that to maintain the **British** iron and steel industry in a state of efficiency,, strenuous efforts are absolutely necessary.

* They send it to the United Kingdom and to other parts of the world,; taking away the trade of **British** manufacturers, and also, which is more serious, taking -away employment and the incentive to produce.

* It makes my blood boil when men ask for preference from Great Britain, and, at the same time, take up the miserable position that we should not appoint **British** officers to positions for which they are better qualified than are our own citizens.

* The other night a member of the Opposition, because he wished to allow **British** goods to be imported into Australia, was told by an honorable member supporting the Government that he was not an Australian.

* I need scarcely remind honorable members that  a  little more than a year ago the Brisbane Grammar School Cadet Corps defeated all the public schools throughout the **British** Empire in rifle shooting.

* The shooting of these corps, in competition with the whole of the schools of the **British** Empire, proves that the Australian youth is quite able to hold his own with the rifle.

* But the **British** Government have undoubtedly laid it down as the basis of their defence schemes that the **British** Navy is, in their opinion, adequate to maintain the general command of the sea.

* That is the policy of the **British** Government.

* We, in Australia, admit that we are dependent upon the **British** Navy to protect us from the great risks which Britons everywhere depend upon their Navy to defend them from.

* Military training may be excellent for the improvement of the national stamina, .but huge military preparations presuppose from a defence point of view the loss of **British** supremacy in Eastern waters.

* of an exceedinglydrastic character, the course which is ordinarily followed in **British** communities, so far as accused persons are concerned, might surely be continued.

* The **British** House of Commons and House of Lords have authorized, by Statute, the publication of parliamentary reports and papers laid before them.

* that, by virtue of section 49 of the Constitution, we possess all the powers, privileges, and immunities of the **British** House of Commons, and that amongst them is the power to authorize the publication by the Government Printer of parliamentary papers and reports.

* According to the article in that journal, the report stated that between 1884 and 1904 the total emigration of **British** subjects and foreigners from **British** ports had increased from 303,901 to 453,877, but that the proportion directed to Australia and New Zealand had declined from nearly 46,000 to a little over 14,000 - a decline which is somewhat disconcerting from the Imperial point of view.

* It was further pointed out that during 1904 the actual net emigration to Australia and New Zealand - that means, I take it, the emigration from **British** .

* All the imported iron was **British** and foreign produce, and the market was quite as free to the Victorian product as to the foreign product.

* -Western Australia imported from Victoria 119 tons 1 cwt., but how is the honorable member to say that that was not originally **British** or foreign ?

* on **British** imports, and Australia is near the bottom with an average of 6 per cent.

* So far as it can be calculated, it is estimated that if the duties levied on **British** goods only were levied on all imports therewould be a reduction of 500,000 in the estimated revenue of 8,229,000 from the new Tariff.

* Our aim and object should be to make the Royal Navy the Empire's Navy, and not solely supported by the people of the **British** Isles, as is practically the case at the present time.

* Admiralty, and with the people of the other self-governing Dominions of the Empire; and, above all, we are showing to the world that the **British** Dominions beyond the sea are determined, without any pressure, of our own free will, in the time of peace and prosperity, to make such provision that, should the day of adversity unhappily come upon us, we shall be in a position to stand shoulder to shoulder with our kinsmen of the Old Land.

* The **British** people are already taxed considerably over 1 a head for the naval defence of the 
The toll system has been in use in the United Kingdom for some time, with the result that it is applied to 90 per cent, of the telephone subscribers there.

* John  Gavey,  Engineer-in-Chief of the **British** Post Office, who makes these very pertinent remarks - 
That proposal was practically, made to override the objection of those who use the telephone to its fullest extent.

* Evidence was also given before the Committee by  Sir William  P reece, one of the greatest authorities on telephony in the **British** Empire.

* He has spoken of such a navy as a tinpot one, and has dealt sarcastically with our universal service proposals twitting us with the desire to save our own miserable skins, and to refuse to support any further contribution to the cost of the **British** Navy.

* My  Advisers sometime ago cabled to the **British** Government suggesting the advisability of a Conference of the self-governing Dominions of the Empire with the Government of the United Kingdom on the question of Naval Defence.

* There are at the head of affairs in the **British** Empire minds quite as alert as is his own,' quite as anxious to preserve **British** supremacy as he is, and they are not likely to neglect any opportunity to protect the interests of Great Britain.

* When we reflect that there are only 214 **British** residents, exclusive of missionaries, in these islands, after forty years of occupation, I think it will be recognised that their resources cannot be of a very attractive character.

* The French exceed the **British** on five islands, the **British** exceed the French on five, and on two the numbers are equal.

* In the Banks and Torres groups - which consist of a series of small islands connecting the New Hebrides with the Solomons, the **British** preponderate.

* The **British** and French have each a Resident Commissioner stationed at Vila, on Efate, or Sandwich Islands, the principal port.

* amending Bill on the lines of the new **British** Act.

* I understand that the rates of duty chargeable on **British** goods are not to be altered, so long as such goods are brought here in **British**, vessels.

* The reason for making a concession to **British** goods shipped on foreign vessels until the 30th August is that, unless the proposal of the Government is agreed to, goods sent from Great Britain at the same time may arrive here, partly in foreign and partly in **British** vessels, and one consignment will be charged a duty of 20 per cent, and another of 30 per cent.

* No difficulty arises in respect of foreign goods, because they are dutiable at the higher rates,  whether brought here in **British** or foreign bottoms.

* Clause 40 of the Papua (**British** New Guinea) Bill provides that- 
My first deduction is that the Ministry would not insert such a provision if it were not a proper one to make.

* Here we are dealing with millions of tons of shipping - the shipping trade of the **British** Empire - and with the contracts upon which the whole of that trade is based, and surely a Bill' of this kind is of sufficient importance to reserve for the pleasure of the superior authorities.

* supposed would confer immediately a security for industrial peace, is to  be " hung up " in the legal rooms of the **British** Government for very mature and careful consideration if these clauses are inserted.

* On the 27th of April, 1S92, a Bill with this object was introduced into the **British** Legislature ; and  Mr. Balfour  and several others spoke warmly in favour of the reform.

* a large proportion of these women are in the **British** Isles.

* It is because of the existence of facts such as those which roy authorities speak of that a proposal is emanating from the **British** Government for preferential trade within the Empire, and it is strange that opposition to that proposal should come from Australia.

* That conference unanimously agreed to the following resolutions : - 
Whereas the stability and progress of the **British** Empire can be best assured by drawing continually closer the bonds that unite the colonies with the mother country, and by the continuous growth of a practical sympathy aud co-operation in all that pertains to their common welfare.

* As members of the **British** race, we have an equally strong desire to be ready to serve in the defence of our country.

* Those who oppose universal training may say that the very name of conscription is repugnant to the **British** people.

* Many persons are anxious to knit the Empire still more closely together, and I would ask honorable members what those persons will think of a proposal to penalize **British** shipping.

* Are we to penalize **British** vessels, and (o allow those of foreign countries engaging in our trade to be free from any restriction?

* Are foreign steamers to be allowed to enjoy a special advantage over **British** vessels in the Australian trade?

* It is somewhat strange that Australia, one of the brightest gems in the **British** Crown, should be about the first to propose to .penalize the shipping interests of Great Britain.

* It would further be able to deal with the question whether these clauses would penalize **British** ships, and thus confer an additional advantage on the subsidized steam-ships of foreign countries.

* I appeal to the Government not to penalize **British** shipping to the advantage of foreign shipping.

* But if the islands are of such great importance as has been represented, from a strategic point of view, I think the **British** Government should take action, and not leave us to spend our money in conserving what are really their interests.

* Of the **British** residents in those islands, thirty-four are missionaries, and there is no doubt that they have been the principal sources of the information derived by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and others who have spoken in favour of  the  subsidy.

* The honorable member for Lang told us that the **British** Government had been exercising control over the New Hebridies for forty years, and that the total re: sult of all their efforts had been the settlement of 245 Britishers in the group.

* I admit that they are **British** subjects, but I cannot call them Australian settlers when they settle outside the Commonwealth.

* That I have withdrawn myself from the **British** Medical Association of which I was a member, and am now, so far as that association is concerned, a non-unionist.

* He should never forget that it is one of the primary instincts of men born and bred under **British** conditions that they shall have a perfect right to work freely for their own living, whether they are members of unions or not.

* The Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Bill having been reserved for the signification of  His  Majesty's pleasure, there is no authority under which to continue to collect them.

* The alleged murderers were tried before the Chief Justice of **British** New Guinea, in November, 1901.

* A considerable portion of **British** New Guinea is still unexplored ; and even in the better-known districts the natives are hardlyyet under the complete control of the Government.

* Will he cause representations to be made to the **British** Government and to the Japanese Government as to the implied threat on the part of the latter in its Admiral's statement?

* Last of all, the **British**- Australian Tobacco Manufacturing  Company, which had been formed to fight the foreign companies, appointed Kronheimer Limited sole distributer of their manufactures in Australia.

* of the **British** Australian Tobacco Manufacturing Company, filed in April last, and I have been surprised to see how great an interest is Held in it by persons who are not residents of Australia.

* I understand that the objections to that system are mainly financial ; and I propose to show that where it has been established within the **British** Empire, and in other countries, it has never been productive of the heavy loss here anticipated, any deficiencies being of a temporary character.

* Prior to 1840, the lowest rate in the **British** Isles was 2d., and that was applicable only to places within eight miles of each other, being virtually a suburban rate.

* I may be told that it is hardly fair to draw an analogy between the system in its operation in the **British** 
Isles, and the system in its operation in the Commonwealth - that the **British** Isles are a thickly populated country, of short distances, whereas the Commonwealth is a country of great distances and sparse settlement.

* It must be remembered, however, that the **British** Isles of 40 years ago were very different from the **British** Isles of to-day.

* There is more analogy between the **British** Isles of 40 years ago and the Commonwealth of to-day, than there is between the **British** Isles of to-day and the Commonwealth of to-day.

* Sixty years ago distance was not annihilated to the extent it has been since, and journeys which now occupy a few hours then took many days ; so that, in the matter of expensive communication, the analogy between the **British** Isles of that day and the Commonwealth of to-day is not very remote.

* The report states : - 
On December 2.5th, 1898, as  a  result of the conference of representatives of various portions of the **British** Empire, held in London, beginning on Jane 25th, 1898, to deal with the subject of reduced postage within the Empire, the rate for letter postage between Canada and the mother country and various other portions of the Empire was reduced from 5 cents to 2 cents per half ounce.

* New Zealand adopted the universal penny postage system in March 1901 ; but it is a curious thing that whilst, until very lately, a person residing there could post letters to distant countries, such as Chili, and most of the South American States, Italy, Canada, and any part of the **British** Isles, the postage to Australia was 2d., and, even now, although letters can be sent from New Zealand to Australia for Id.

* But under the system I am advocating a State Government could go to the National Postal Bank in the State, and get a credit on the ledger, just in the same way as the **British** Government have a credit on the ledger of the Bank of England, and as the municipalities have credits.

* The " **British** Bullion Committee " of 1810, recorded an emphatic statement, that, in the presence of a panic, it is the duty of the Bank of.

* In  1893  thebanks which suspended held  68,000,000  of the people's money ; and of  , 51,500,000  of fixed deposits,  17,000,000  was due to **British** depositors, and  34,500,000  to Australian depositors.

* 1  quote these figures to show why Britishers stopped depositing in Australia - why **British** capital stopped coming here.

* A short time ago a man resident in my electorate complained to me that, although he had taken out letters of naturalization in Queensland and had subsequently secured employment in the railway service of New South Wales, he had been told by the Railway Commissioners that he would have to cease work because he was not a naturalized **British** subject.

* Action has also been taken to provide for a supplyof the new short end Enfield rifle (which is an improved magazine rifle) adopted by the **British** War Office.

* I may mention that in the late Boer war, with 250,000 **British** troops operating, the total expenditure was only some  66,000,000  rounds of ball cartridges, spread over a period of practically three years.

* It is unquestionably desirable that we should show our loyalty to the **British** Government in this matter, and it would be idle to speak of Australia as independent of Great Britain in regard to defence.

* We should be in a perilous position to-morrow if it were not for the protection of the **British** flag.

* When a person invents a design - especially if he be a **British** subject - and registers it here, he should not be prevented, even when there are no manufacturers of goods of that design in Australia, from taking action against competitors elsewhere who may be pirating it and using it to his detriment here.

* We have specifically accepted from the **British** Government the care of **British** New Guinea, as being part of our special Australian duty, and it seems to me that in doing so we have accepted the whole responsibility of looking after it.

* From the stand-point of defence **British** New Guinea is apart of the Commonwealth.

* We have accepted the obligation, and if our troops are not to go to **British** New Guinea under the general terms of their oath they should not be required under the terms of that oath to leave their own State in the performance of their duty.

* AVe must protect **British** New Guinea and our Defence Forces are as much bound to go there if ordered to do so, as they are bound to defend any part of our shores.

* but a navysupplied by the money of the Old Country, to be placed and kept under the control of the **British** Admiralty, against the wishes of Australia.

* Mr.CHANTER.- I understand now that if the Australian Parliament says, "We want to keep these ships for defencepurposes," the **British** Admiralty cannot take them away from us.

* Request- Insert after "Rifles;" in both paragraphs, the words "bearing the **British** or other approved test mark."

* Has his attention been called to the following editorial notice appearing in the  Farmer and Settler  (New South Wales), 7th May, 1909 :  - " The **British** Immigration League of Australia has just welcomed a batch of imgrants from England.

* scurrilous attacks made so widely and persistently in Europe, and by a few misguided persons in the United Kingdom itself, upon the good faith of the **British** people and the conduct of His Majesty's troops now serving in South Africa, call for some public expression of our unabated and whole-hearted sympathy with the mother country and our unbroken confidence in the conspicuous and chivalrous humanity of the Imperial forces.

* On the 6th of January, if I may quote from the  Argus,  I find that the **British** soldiers and officers were charged with having ravished a third of the Boer women and children, and with having then handed them over to the Kaffirs.

* The Secretary of State for the Colonies, exercising his undoubted right of addressing ' an audience of his fellow citizens in England, had previously said that if the **British** army needed precedents for pursuing a certain line of conduct they could find them in the history of the conduct of the armies of other powers.

* He did not accuse those powers of doing anything beyond what was sanctioned by the rights and the laws of war, but merely pointed out that precedent would afford the **British** army justification for taking a much stronger course than has been taken.

* Our troops are serving in this war under **British** generals, and are bound to subscribe to the articles of wai1.

* All these acts which are laid to the charge of **British** soldiers are, when Australian troops are often indiscriminately drafted with them - charges against our troops as well as against those of the United Kingdom.

* On the 13th January, quoting from the same paper, I find that  Mr. Chamberlain  was called by a member of the Reichstag " the most accursed scoundrel on God's earth," whilst the **British** army was described as " a pack of thieves."

* In view of that declaration of war, there were only two things which a merciful and humane **British** Government could do.

* When our gallant French neighbours give way to periodical fits of spleen against the **British** we feel no sort of discomfort, and probably no irritation ; but when a country like Germany talks of being the.

* traditional friend and ally of Great Britain, yet gives way at the same time - because after all it is the nation that makes an alliance, and not the Emperor - when we find practically the whole people giving way to this gust of hatred-- 
These wholesale  fabrications,  imputing the most inhuman, monstrous barbarity to **British** soldiers and **British** statesmen, cannot be disregarded.

* We all know - and there, I think, there is no respectable authority that differs - that in the great wars in which the **British** armies and navies of the past have taken part, the **British** soldier and the **British** sailor was always conspicuous not only for his valour in the hour of strife, but for his tenderness and humanity when the battles were over.

* The **British** Iron Commission of 1902, reporting upon the position there, states that the bulk of the disputes are now settled by conferences between employers and employes - by meetings between organization and organization, and by industrial agreements, extending, in some cases, over several States.

* What is the very essence of the **British** Constitution ?

* So that, if we analyze the Constitution, or recognise the very essence of the **British** system of government, we shall find it impossible, while respecting leading principles, to place the States under the jurisdiction of the proposed Conciliation and Arbitration Board.

* I hold, therefore, that the moment any **British** or foreign vessel approaches within three miles of our coast, it will become subject to the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, whose award will be binding upon it, notwithstanding any limitations - unless they expressly affect this measure - which may be imposed by the Navigation Bill.

* The Premier of New South Wales stated at a luncheon which was held on the  Yongala,  one of the Adelaide Steamship Company's vessels, on December 30 last, that foreigners ought to be forced by **British** legislation to recipro- cate.

* I intend to deal with the question of reciprocity presently, because there is really a good deal of misunderstanding as to what foreigners are doing in regard to **British** trade.

* So that, for the sake of interfering with a freight trade of 25,000 annually which is done by ocean-going vessels between Fremantle and the eastern ports, we are asked to introduce harassing provisions which may militate against the large carry ing trade enjoyed in foreign waters by the **British** Empire.

* At any rate, the bulk of the carrying trade is done by **British** vessels.

* the very large carrying trade which is done by **British** vessels in foreign waters?

* Take the trade of the United Kingdom with **British** possessions.

* Of the vessels engaged in the trade between Colonies and Colonies, 87 per cent, are of **British** registration.

* The figures in this connexion are not, perhaps, so accurate as they might be, but it has been roughly estimated that 96 per cent, of that trade is done by **British** vessels.

* of the trade between the United Kingdom and foreign countries is done by **British** vessels.

* If we take the total **British** tonnage entered and cleared in foreign ports, we find that it represents 106,000,000, whereas the tonnage of foreign vessels entered and cleared in **British** ports amounts to only 48:600;000 tons.

* He says that even if subsidies were granted, they would only prove of great benefit to a maximum of 39 per cent, of **British** shipping, that they would injure 47 per cent., and would have little effect on 14 per cent.

* With regard to married women, it was provided that an alien woman who married a **British** subject became thereby a **British** subject herself, and remained so until after the death of her husband, or her divorce from him, she married an alien ; while a naturalized woman who married an alien lost her **British** nationality.

* As to men and unmarried women, the provisions as to whom I recounted just now, the Bill, as amended, provides that all aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the Pacific Islands, except New 
No, nothing can exclude a natural-born **British** subject.

* As a result, the only difference in fact between women and men under the Bill appears to be this : that there are two ways in which a woman may be naturalized - first by application, and secondly by marrying a **British** subject.

* Under the Bill as originally introduced an alien woman who married a **British** subject would become a **British** subject, and remain so until after the death of her husband, or her divorce from him.

* If she afterwards remarried with  an alien she would cease to be a **British** subject.

* She would be of the **British** nationality which her first marriage conferred upon her.

* Then the naturalized woman who married an alien lost her nationality, and that again was in accordance with either the English Act or with the report of the **British** Naturaliza* tion Committee.

* It was not deemed necessary to provide for women who were natural-born **British** subjects, and who married aliens.

* That would appear to have been so under the **British** law of 1870.

* There are two ways in which an alien woman may be naturalized, one method being by application - a right which she has in common with men - and the other being by marriage with a **British** subject.

* It would appear that the amendment made in this respect has put aside the principle of law laid down in the English Naturalization Act of 1870, that a **British** woman who marries an alien becomes an alien, because the Bill now provides that if a woman who is a **British** subject marries an alien, she shall retain her nationality.

* Therefore, a marriage with an alien will make no difference in the status of a woman who is a **British** subject.

* With regard to children, I have already pointed out that, as originally introduced, the Bill provided that an infant whose father or mother had become naturalized **British** subjects should, during infancy, become naturalized subjects also, but that that qualification should cease upon their attaining the age of 21, when they would have the right to apply for naturalization in the ordinary way.

* Not in the Bill as it now stands, but in clause 10, as originally produced, it was provided that the children of naturalized **British** subjects.

* In the meantime, we shall endeavour to induce the Admiralty to modify some of the conditions in its last despatch, so that we may submit our scheme to Parliament with the enormous advantage of the approbation of **British** naval experts.

* When self-government has been granted to any portion of the **British** Dominions, when its citizens have been in trusted with the right of managing their affairs, you have in the political world something which is analogous to the proposal that we make in the naval world.

* Whether he has seen the report that the **British** Government has already received back the whole of the capital originally invested by it in Suez Canal shares, together with 3 per cent.

* Will he be good enough to say what representations he has made to the **British** Government in this regard with a view to securing some reduction on the existing heavy Canal dues, which considerably increase the charges upon Commonwealth exports and imports?

* one of the most distinguished officers of the **British** Army, on an invitation conveyed through the Governor-General.

* The amendment emanating from the Labour Party is one to differentiate between the tribute of Australian loyalty and those which come from all other parts of the wide world where the **British** race has settled.

* Their proposal is that Australia shall be isolated - that she shall be the only non-unionist in the **British** Empire.

* He actually had the audacity to refer to the Prime Minister as one who was acting hypocritically in attempting to establish a system of preferential trade between the Commonwealth and one of the adjacent Colonies of the **British** Empire.

* The honorable and learned member for Parkes warned the Committee that, if we adopted this treaty, and persevered in 'the policy of granting preferences to the products of other parts of the **British** Empire, we might give rise to international difficulties.

* We must either be prepared to see the manufacturers of Great Britain superseded in their own markets by those of other countries or run the risk of causing some irritation to other nations by granting a preference to **British** products.

* It appears to me that it would be the simplest thing on earth for **British** or foreign ship-owners to evade any provision which we might choose to insert in this Bill regarding the wages to be paid by them whilst their vessels were trading upon the Australian coast.

* Let me take the case of the **British** shipping companies as an example.

* Under these provisions, if **British** or foreign companies engage in the Australian trade, they will have to pay the local rates.

* It is utterly beyond our power to raise the wages of the whole of the **British** seamen, however much we might desire to achieve that end.

* Is it a fact that although sheep-shearing machines (of **British** manufacture) are on the free list, Customs duty at the rate of 25 per cent, is being charged on the whole of the overhead gearing, including the brackets which are claimed to be an integral part of the shearing machine, and useless in themselves for any other purpose ?

* They will, therefore, be admitted free, if of **British** origin.

* Unless the Prime Minister is prepared to make the question of the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants in **British** New Guinea the subject of a Government measure next session it will not be dealt with.

* Honorable members will recollect that, a little while ago, there was a majority of thirteen in favour of imposing a prohibition upon the sale of intoxicants in **British** New Guinea.

* As most of the rugs imported come from the United Kingdom, the duty will affect chiefly **British** manufacturers.

* The total disability of the Australian woollen manufacturer compared with his **British** competitor, is, therefore, on these findings, not more than 2 per cent, on equipment and 10 per cent, in labour, or a total of 12 per cent, .on the value of the product.

* As against this the **British** manufacturer who competes in Australia pays 15 per cent, duty and from 7 to 12^ per cent, charges, or a minimum total of 22^ per cent, on his goods, and this without taking into consideration an average increase in the cost of Australian wool, delivered at the mill in England, of 16J per cent.

* In connexion with the reported withdrawal of **British** warships from the search for the  Waratah,  and in view of the fact that shipmasters seem to be almost without exception of opinion that the vessel is still afloat, will the Prime Minister communicate with the Admiralty as to whether they cannot see their way clear to make another effort to find the vessel ?

* We have also been !old that the incident of the six hatters has caused the **British** investor to look upon Australia as a place to be avoided, and that, because we considered that certain men who had violated our laws should be detained here for several days, there is not a capitalist in the old country who would lend us a farthing.

* In my opinion, the **British** investor does not care a continental rap for section  1 6  of the Post and Telegraph Act, nor for the provision relating to the employment of contract labour in the Immigration Restriction Act.

* the administration of justice, at any rate, in **British** communities, that a magistrate should convict a man if it was not proved to his satisfaction that the man was guilty.

* But it is a new idea in **British** jurisprudence to give this power to the prosecution, to enable a case to be made out.

* We should not strain the broad principles of natural justice which have grown up with the nation, and which, even in the darkest days of our history, were the main security of the masses of the **British** people.

* In all countries there are special Acts which go very far; but I do not think' that in any **British** country an accused is compelled to go before his prosecutor, and put everything before him before being tried.

* The whole object was to indicate the individual origin of the goods, or, rouse the words of some of the **British** decisions, " the quality and make of thework turned out."

* The **British** Empire is composed of about 40,000,000 persons in the United Kingdom, and, say, 12,000,000 white persons outside its shores.

* We are bound by this fact, that Australia is the purest **British** possession in the' world.

* With the exception of a few aliens our people are entirely **British**, and we are as free as any nation in the world can be, with simply an Imperial link in which Imperial interests, being our interests, too, have to be studied as well as our local interests.

* Any arrangement which in the future might seem to be detrimental to the real trading, commercial, and other interests of this country from which it seems impossible to recede, might, by the operation of the very system, by the irritation which it engendered, sow seeds of dissolution which would prevent the ultimate union of the **British** Empire.

* We do another trade not merely with the United Kingdom, but with the **British** possessions.

* I desire a plain, businesslike, transaction, and if ever there was a bargain struck in the world, that bargain by which, for 200,000 a year, we gain the security of the **British** Navy is one of the greatest.

* It certainly does not fit in with the beliefs which have made up the framework of **British** character and **British** liberty.

* It has been placed before the **British** public, and there has been no means of getting at the colonial opinion.

* I look to these High Commissioners, and to the conferences which may be held in future between representatives of different parts of the Empire, to pave the way for this political union, but I deprecate as I said before, any attempt for electioneering purposes, either here or at home, to force a question so full of great importance to the future destiny of the **British** Empire.

* That country is a great commercial country, and the people know that the 2,000,000,000 to which the right honorable member for East Sydney referred in his interview the other day, though perhaps he slightly exceeded the real amount, as being lent to other parts of the world by the **British** people, was earned from commerce, trade, and manufactures.

* I might also mention that His Excellency, to my personalknowledge, was put to very great expense in preparing for his Governor-Generalship, to an amount far beyond anything he could have received by way of allowance from the **British** Government.

* Of course I do not regard the owners of **British** vessels as foreigners in the conventional sense, but they must be distinguished from local ship-owners.

* We know that the seamen on **British** and foreign vessels receive lower rates of pay than are given to the seamen on Australian, vessels.

* Whilst I shall vote for the motion, for the reason that I am a thorough believer in the **British** Empire, and recognise that it will give England a slight advantage over the foreigner, I feel that we ought to do something more than this.

* If this Court is to give effect to the respondent's contention, we shall be placing a construction upon the Statute' opposed to every principle of what, is right and just, and to  the  entire spirit of **British** law.

* 1 
We are members of a **British** community, and we are accustomed to the scales of justice being held evenly.

* As a matter of fact, in the years gone by, **British** law was most effective in protecting the poorer classes of the community, who would otherwise have suffered severely at the hands of their oppressors.

* But let us see what will be the result if we refuse to ratify the proposed agreement with the **British** Government for the payment of the naval subsidy.

* Instead of paying 200,000 a year, which is the amount of subsidy proposed to be paid under the Bill, we should have to pay probably 600,000 or 700,000 a year, and then should be only in the same position as that in which we shall be if we agree to the proposals of the **British** Government.

* In addition to that, no doubt we shall require an Australian navy for the purpose of protecting us from attacks by foreign vessels which may be able to pass the patrolling ships of the **British** squadrons in the seas some distance away.

* I think that the 
Exactly, and that is one of the reasons why Canada does not see the necessity of contributing towards the support of the **British** Navy.

* The present Government remains in power owing very largely to the support which they derive from the French-Canadians, because the **British** vote is at present split.

* But if the **British** vote could be united again, and there should be a change of Government, I am sure that an overpowering influence would be exerted in favour of the payment by Canada of a naval subsidy similar to that contributed by Australia.

* The honorable member says "Hear, hear," but if an enemy were a few hundred miles away from our coasts, does the honorable member mean to say that the **British** Admiral would wait to consult the Governments of the States, one by one, for the purpose of obtaining their consent to withdraw the fleet and engage the enemy?

* I was rather surprised to hear the honorable member for Bland express his disagreement with the general policy of the **British** Navy, and with the necessity for having that navy to protect us.

* I ask honorable members whether, last session, we should have dared to pass the Immigration Restriction Act, had it not been that we relied upon the protection that is afforded us by the **British** fleet  1  Should ' we have dared to flout Japan in the way that we did, had we not been conscious of the strong arm that  was behind us ?

* Should we have ventured to take the action that we did, .had we been standing, as it were, upon our own bottom, and lacking a fleet to protect us  1 
It is all very well to make that statement, because we knew that we had the strength of the **British** Navy behind us, but I hold that the Act in question may yet lead us into serious complications with the Japanese nation. '

* It might act as a check, and keep a hostile fleet at bay for a time, but it would be absolutely useless for the adequate defence of Australia unless a large **British** fleet cooperated with it.

* We find that the nations which have come to the front in modern times are those whose power is really built on iron, such as Great) Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan and Canada, which is one of the growing provinces of the **British** Empire.

* Those of us who intend to vote for prohibition will vote in the true interests of the temperance principle in **British** New Guinea.

* I do not wonder at his theoretical defence of trade unions, because he has belonged to one of the closest trade unions that exists under the regis of the law in **British** communities, and one that visits all kinds of penalties upon any attempt at blacklegging.

* whole conception of trade unionism is different from that which obtains in Australia, or other part of the **British** Empire.

* There we read of abuses, among trade unionsand with trade union officials, just as we read -of corruption in Congress and the States Legislatures - features which happily are absent from the group of Austra- 
Iian States, and from practically every part of the **British** Empire.

* But if we are going to retain the **British**  or mixed duo-decimal system, I hold that our coins ought to be as nearly like the **British** coins as possible, with a mark upon them to enable us to know the authority responsible for replacing them.

* It would save a great deal of time in education in our schools, and when we followed it up by the decimalization of weights and measures, or, at any rate, of weights, as we easily could, we should then have simplified our business transactions, helped towards successful competition with the rest of the world, and established a system that would not only be more easily understood by the people than our present one, but could be in calculation changed from the present **British** system of money and weights to our own with the greatest ease.

* The contracts entered into with the crews are through contracts, and cannot possibly affect the rate of wages in Australia.It is unfortunate that in these times, when so much is being said about the Imperial spirit, we should be embarrassed in our relations with the **British** Government.

* I think it is probable that if the constitutionality of these provisions were tested from the point of view of applying the test only to **British** subjects, the Courts would declare that we have no power to enforce them.

* In connexion with the exclusion of **British** subjects, it has been laid down, apparently by some very able legal writers, that as an inference from the decision of 1747 in the  Aeneus  Mac donnell  case, the power to exclude **British** subjects is not amongst those which are delegated to a colonial Legislature.

* The protest forwarded by the Prime Minister was directed against a wholesale proposal to substitute coloured foreign for **British** white labour in a country whose inclusion in the **British** Empire was partly secured by the efforts of Australian soldiers against a method of development the opposite of that adopted here under circumstances by no means dissimilar.

* There are really only two **British** ownerships, though, in saying that fifty-one of the companies are in the hands of the Jews, I am regarding as to some extent, under Jewish management, the mines of the Rhodes estate.

* We shall have in South Africa a mixed, race - a mixture, say, of mongolians and kaffirs, negro, **British**, and Dutch, all blending together to produce one effete progeny.

* On that occasion he said - 
This proposal requires that we should abandon our system in favour of theirs, and it is in effect, that while the Colonies should be absolutely free to impose what protective duties they please, both on foreign countries and on **British** commerce, they would be required to make a small discrimination in favour of **British** trade, in return for which we are expected to change our whole system and impose duties on food and raw material.

* It shows that we should not disturb the existing trade relations of the Empire, because, on the whole, it will be found that the exports of **British** possessions to foreign countries exceed the imports.

* I find that while the **British** possessions, as a whole, send 43 per cent, of their exports to foreign countries, only 38 per cent, of their imports come from foreign countries!

* The **British** Possessions do not send their exports to other countries merely because of feelings of international beneficence; they know that the balance will be rectified.

* The **British** Imperial Oil Company, in addition to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, is already supplying oil of 100 degrees Fah.

* Messrs. Alexander Cowan and Sons,  agents for the Otto and Crossley engines, which are known all over Australia - and which I have repeatedly used - unhesitatingly recommend the oil supplied by the **British** Imperial Oil Company for use in those engines.

* If it be agreed to, there will still be 2 market in Australia' for the **British** Imperial Company's oil over the, 97 degrees test.

* Yet there are more inhabitants on King Island than there are **British** settlers in the New Hebrides ; and, moreover, King Island forms part and parcel of the Commonwealth, whilst the New Hebrides are beyond our limits.

* It is ridiculous to talk of granting special facilities to the **British** settlers in the Pacific Islands, whilst we are denying ordinary postal conveniences to our own citizens.

* If that is not the position, are we to assume that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat is going to acquiesce in the lowering of the duties at present existing in favour of **British** goods?

* He spoke about the example of the **British** Parliament in this matter ; but responsible government is not achieved by a decision such as that of the Ministry in respect to the Iron Bonus Bill.

* I have never made any pretence of regard for responsible government as it has been understood and written about in **British** communities for many years past.

* I have great sympathy with the remarks of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, who contended that the steamers should be manned solely by Australian or **British** seamen.

* On the contrary, if other proposals made by us to the **British** Government had been accepted we should have been able to do this, and to bring our shipping service into greater harmony with that of the old country, while more closely studying the requirements of the Empire.

* Although no stipulation is made in that regard, however, I have yet to learn that the new fleet will =not be manned by **British** seamen.

* There is at present' on the **British** Register shipping amounting to 9,000,000 tons, whose value is estimated at 150,000,000, and whose gross earnings amount to 90,000,000 a year.

* In respect of that shipping the mother country provides, by, vote of Parliament, 1,127,000 a year - 860,000 for mail services, 200,000 for subventions which enable the **British** Government to claim the services of ships built to her order in time of war, and 53,000 in subsidies for no other consideration than the encouragement of trade.

* From one of the latest numbers of  Dun's International Review,  My point is that, though the **British** Governmentpays only  per cent, upon the capital invested in the shipping of the United Kingdom, the German Government pays as much as 9 per cent., and gives other indirect concessions that, probably, raise the total to  to  per cent, or ri per cent.

* In addition to that,  Sir James  Laing and Sons, who have taken a leading position as the firm responsible for this contract, are associated, so I am informed - on the authority of  Mr. Croker  as their agent - with the following eminent **British** ship-builders : - Vickers, Son, and Maxim, one of the largest ship-builders in the United Kingdom.

* I need scarcely remind honorable members that on Wednesday afternoon next, it is proposed that this Parliament, on behalf of the Commonwealth, shall give its official welcome to the representatives of the Chambers ofCommerce of the Mother Country, Canada, and; in fact, of all the **British** Dominions, who by that time will be in this city.

* The **British** Judge has not yet been appointed.

* The attention of the **British** Government has been called to these statements.

* From the statement referred to, it appears tihat the **British** Government is now  disposed  to accept the offer made by that of the Commonwealth, viz., to accept and deliver as fully prepaid letters from Great Britain bearing the penny rate, while maintaining the existing rate of 2d.

* The estimated loss that would accrue to the Commonwealth by the adoption of the penny rate to the United Kingdom and **British** Possessions is21,000 per annum.

* But we are His Majesty's Opposition, and representative government, as we understand it in the **British** dominions, cannot be carriedon unless there is a properly organized Opposition to criticise the Ministerial proposals.

* I would ask the House, when this debate is adjourned, to go into Committee, and deal with the three postponed  clauses of the Papua (**British** New Guinea) Bill.

* If the proposed immigrants are of **British** birth or descent, all that is necessary is that the contracts relating to their employment shall be filled before their admission, and that such contracts shall show that the men are not brought here in contemplation of an industrial dispute, and that the terms of their agreements are not unfair.

* If the proposed contract labourers are not **British**, there is an additional proviso to the effect that it must be shown that a sufficient number of men suitable for the work are not to be found in Australia.

* The only time that the **British** Government attempted to elect a partisan they were beaten.

* Under no other circumstances should the proposed departure from **British** methods be permitted, it being an axiom of **British** law that no man shall be considered guilty until proved to be so.

* The honorable member talks about **British** justice, but he knows that it is not usual to try a man twice for the same offence.

* Did the Chief Judicial Officer of **British** New Guinea, when asked to report on the " O'Brien Affair," state that the action of  Mr. Griffin,  A.R.M., "could not in my opinion be justified either under section 256 or otherwise."

* Did the Prime Minister, in his speech on **British** New Guinea on the 23rd instant, say, " Undoubtedly  Mr. Griffin  made a mistake in the 'O'Brien Case'"?

* I was glad to hear the Prime Minister forecast a course of action which will give **British** settlers there some trading advantage, so far as Australia is concerned, over the rest of the islanders in the Pacific, who owe us no allegiance and are subject altogether to foreign influences.

* Is it correct, as reported in the press, that he will, when visiting England, endeavour to arrange with the **British** Government that the p rofit on the issue of silver currency in the States b e received by the Commonwealth ?

* In either case, is it his intention to conclude an agreement, if possible, when in England, or merely to obtain the consent of the **British** Government to alternative proposals for submission to the Commonwealth Parliament ?

* Australia should be " Sovereign Lord of **British** Realms Oversea."

* Whether he is aware that the first **British** precedent for use, by the King, of
                the title "Sovereign Lord" was when applied us a "despotism by King John
                to Ireland.

* Treaty entered into between the **British** Foreign Office and the French Republic, dated the 8th April, 1904, relating to the New Hebrides?

* Will he make representations to the **British** Government against its arranging any matters affecting Australian interests in Australian waters without consulting the Australian Government, not only in this case, but in future cases?

* Whether his attention has been called to a telegram in to-day's  Age,  stating that the High Court had delivered judgment in the case of  Strechan  v.  The Commonwealth of Australia,  in which plaintiff was non-suited on the plea that the Commonwealth was not responsible for acts committed by **British** New Guinea officials?

* ls it proposed to bring **British** New Guinea under Commonwealth control, and, if so, when is it proposed to take the necessary action to this end?

* It would be wrong to give foreign and **British** vessels trading on our coast a free hand, whilst we handicap Australian ships.

* From the information obtainable, it seems to me that, strictly speaking, the **British** and foreign oversea, ships do not compete with Australian vessels in the Australian coastal trade.

* I have here an extract from a minority report of the **British** Commission, signed by trades union leaders such as W. Abraham, Michael Austin, Jas.

* In referring to the question of the liability of trades union funds, they said - 
The proposition I am about to make will show that the action taken by us in regard to the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) ' Bill was dictated by no desire to score a party success.

* I move - 
That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the 'Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Act.

* The House of Commons contains 670 members, and the **British** Parliament deals with the affairs of one-fifth of the globe.

* Dickenson, who is the greatest authority upon matters of this kind, says in reference to the **British** and American Parliaments - 
I understand the amendment to be to include the words " wire netting made from **British** manufactured wire, and wire made from Australian ore." 
Yes; and it is regrettable that so many important measures should have been submitted for our consideration after the majority of honorable members have gone to their homes.

* The **British** Board of Trade have told us that the Bill in its present form will not prove acceptable, and yet the Government propose to ask the representative of the Crown to assent to it.

* That is not a **British** way of going to a conference.

* It appears to me that, unless such business arrangements as I have indicated are expressly excluded from the operation of the Bill, some business competitor might urge that a certain combination was being entered into to fix prices to the detriment of the public, and that the parties to that combination might be haled before the Judge or the jury to show that they were justified in doing what every citizen of the **British** Empire has a right to do.

* On the one hand it is important to provide that rivals and strangers shall not be given access to the inner workings of a man's business, and, on the other hand, one of the fundamental principles of **British** jurisprudence and procedure is to give publicity, with only such exceptions as are absolutely  necessary.

* I wish to know whether,in view of the significance of the cable, the Prime Minister will impress upon the **British** authorities the importance of the New Hebrides 
Islands to **British** and Australian trading interests, and the necessity that exists for preventing the control of those islands from passing into the hands of any foreign Power.

* But if large areas of land got into the hands of a few people, who desired to take advantage of the labour of the natives - a condition of things neveryet seen in Australia, and one which we donot wish to see in any part of the **British** dominions over which we have control - all sorts of evils might happen.

* Whether, in view of recent statements regarding the unscrupulous practices of the **British** shipping ring, he has taken steps to guarantee that goods foreign-made and dumped into 
Britain will not be shipped to Australia and landed as goods of **British** manufacture admittable under the low preference duties?

* It has Been the desire of this Parliament that the Commonwealth should co-operate with the States to attract a steady stream of **British** immigrants to Australia.

* The **British** public apparently read the legislation upon the subject, and did not care at all for their own particular taste.

* Then the **British** people were not inspired by Victorian law, but dived into the recesses of the regulations and were consoled.

* I object to the further importation of manufactured articles which has the result of keeping our artisans out of work, and that being so, it is only human that I should not wish to see our food products exported in large quantities to the old world, if the effect there would be to cause the **British** working man to pay higher prices for his eatables.

* I think the **British** people are themselves the best judges as to whether preferential trade would or would not be beneficial to them.

* We know that a handful of (people, no more numerous than is the population of Tasmania, held the whole of the **British** Forces at a disadvantage for a long while, and it took the whole of the mercantile marine of Great Britain to supply soldiers, forage, food and war material during the Boer war.

* I think it must be admitted, also, that he created for us a very excellent feeling among the **British** people.

* I venture to say that if an enemy were to land at Port Darwin he might be able to do some damage at Port Darwin, and to the railway and the railway works there, but it would be an absolute trap for him so long as there were any **British** vessels afloat which could intercept his supplies from his base of operations.

* Every one must admit that if it were not for the protection afforded us as an integral portion of the Empire by the **British** Fleet, we should beat the mercy of at least half-a-dozen nations.

* - Undoubtedly it could effect a landing if we had not the **British** Fleet behind us.

* But just as the Boers were able to give the **British** a lot of trouble - and other precedents can be found in history - we could put any invading nation to an enormous expenditure, both in blood and treasure.

* He altogether forgets that if we were contributing that sum towards the maintenance of the **British** Fleet we should be entitled with the mother country to a full voice in the decision of Imperial questions.

* In his speech at the opening of the Imperial Conference the other day  Sir Henry  Campbell-Bannerman is reported in the  Times  to have put the position thus - 
If we were to contribute 5,000,000 yearly as our full share of the cost of maintaining the **British** Fleet we should be entitled to all the powers and privileges which that expenditure would confer upon us.

* Let us increase it if possible, and by so doing we shall show that we appreciate in the highest degree the protection which the **British** Fleet affords us.

* the **British** Government.

* I admit that up to the present we have not been encouraged to look for any practical outcome from the action which has been taken in the **British** Parliament, which has been generally favorable to the adoption of a different system in the calculation of money values, as well as with reference to weights and measures.

* I recognise that the florin was an instalment of the decimalization of the **British** coinage.

* I say at once that if there were any prospect of the **British** Government taking action within a reasonable time, I should be inclined to take the plunge without further inquiry; but, apart from the practical questions involved in Australia, I do not quite appreciate the wisdom, if it can be avoided, of further differentiating .

* The proposal which we are considering does not ask us to adopt the coinage of Great Britain, nor that of Canada, which is another part of the **British** Empire.

* They are, indeed ; but when the proposal was hot - when the hysteria was at its height - every member of other parties was demanding that the Prime Minister should at once cable to the **British** Government the offer of a  Dreadnought.

* We cannot say now whether or not there is to be submitted to the House a motion regarding the presentation of a  Dreadnought  to the **British**.

* They are prepared to do many things which they all declared ought not to be done, but, although they agreed that a  Dreadnought  should be presented to the **British** Government, they are now singularly silent on the subject.

* I would ask honorable members to note that since the close of the Boer war the **British** Government have mot only reduced the income tax- 
On the face of it, this is a proposal to give preference to **British** goods; but, as a matter of fact,' the preference is to be limited to goods carried in **British** bottoms.

* If the preference is to be given to goods of **British** production, why should any distinction be made between' goods carried in **British** and foreign bottoms?

* A grant to **British** settlers who exported maize to the Commonwealth so as to secure them a fixed minimum price of 6s.

* This plan was recommended by Captain Rason; **British** Resident in the New Hebrides, who received the affidavit of each supercargo as to the shipments.

* If the **British** authorities exercised to the full the powers which they possess, they could do many things which they are not likely to do.

* I am satisfied that the **British** Government would not think of acting contrary to the wishes of the Commonwealth in regard to the control of the Northern Territory.

* He will be able to speak on Australia's resources as a whole, and to put before the **British** people the intentions and aims of Australian legislation.

* Generally speaking, they have taken advantage of the opportunity to impart to the **British** public a knowledge of the nature and resources of their States.

* Thus the office is appreciated by the **British** public and the Australian abroad, and serves this Government in various ways.

* We may advertise generally, to convey to the **British** public a proper conception of the financial security and stability of the country.

* A great deal is now being done to inform the **British** public regarding legislation on such matters as the Tariff, the Commerce Act, and the Immigration Restriction Act, and the work will increase as our Acts increase.

* We have exercised our powers under the Commerce Act to deal with the question of exports; and it seems a logical step to take the view that the produce sent to the **British** market is the produce of Australia, and not the produce of a particular State.

* There is no doubt that if we can place our resources as a whole before the **British** people, Australia need not fear comparison with any part of the Empire, whether in regard to production, manufacture, trade, or in any other respect.

* Such resources are an Australian asset, and we should have no other object than to place before the **British** public, in the fairest and best possible light, the advantages of Australia as a whole.

* Although the members of that committee had the blood of Britons coursing through their veins and talked of loyalty to the **British** workman, they gave this contract to a firm carrying on operations in Germany.

* An association, entitled " The Empire Builders Limited," was formed in London at the beginning of last year, with  Sir William  M. N. Young as  president,  for the purpose of encouraging and assisting by emigration the peopling of the large unoccupied areas of **British** dependencies, and principally Canada and Australasia.

* He arrived in Melbourne yesterday on board the German mail steamer  Zieten  with a party of twelve immigrants, the first, he hopes, of many hundreds of **British** agriculturists to arrive in this State.

* If they would leave us alone when talking their cant, we should not mind, but they attack us for want of patriotism when we have more true **British** feeling in one drop of our blood than they have in the whole of their bodies.

* It' is one of the boasts of the country from which we have obtained our traditions and our institutions that these rival political forces can never interfere with the even, impartial flow of **British** justice.

* My reply is because, a majority of this House believe that when this preference is to be within the power of a **British** Court of Justice, and when it affects the daily rights and opportunities of the working citizens of Australia, the Judge should at least have an opinion - having the discretion in a Court of equity to arrive at that opinion - that there is a majority, not of trade unionists, but a majority of trade unionists combined with others outside engaged in the industry, who have no objection to preference.

* The result of their recommendation was that in 1896 a law was placed on the **British** statute-book, entitled " An Act for the better prevention and settlement of trade and industrial disputes," which provides for a system of purely voluntary conciliation.

* It is more easy to deal with **British** than with foreign vessels.

* I think that the honorable member for Parramatta was labouring under a misapprehension when he charged the honorable and learned member for Corio with desiring to destroy **British** institutions.

* A letter which I have received from Tumbarumba, in New South Wales, raises this very peculiar point : Is a man, born in Hanover, when that country was under the rule of the **British** sovereign, a citizen of Great Britain?

* The House of Commons holds : - That any one born of **British** born parents will be considered a **British** subject.

* Father remained **British**, until he died, to draw his pension.

* Some months ago the Prime Minister, when in London, represented to the **British** authorities that the Commonwealth desires to terminate this agreement, because it regards the subsidy payable under it as a tax upon its -resources, and thinks that the money could be better spent in other directions.

* The **British** authorities replied that, if Australia finds the subsidy a burden, they will not object to the termination of the agreement.

* The honorable gentleman should employ the keenest business acumen in his negotiations, because Australia must have a position in a front street, and must make herself as well known to the **British** public as Canada has done in the past.

* In 1907, she sent ^9,800, and 24,700 **British** persons left Australia.

* Personally, if we could secure free-trade throughout the **British** Empire, I should be ready to support the highest protection against the outer world.

* It is idle for protectionists to declare that they favour the imposition of a duty of 40 per cent, upon goods from the outside world and of only 35 per cent, upon **British** goods.

* There is absolutely no justification for increasing the duties upon these commodities against the foreigner, seeing - as I have already stated - that two- thirds of them are of **British** origin.

* The Government have doubled the duty against the **British** manufacturer in the first instance, then they have doubled it upon the consumer, and finally they have said, "We will increase the impost against the foreigner by 5 per cent."

* The Government believe so strongly in preferential trade .that they are prepared to double the duty, and give a preference of 5 per cent, to **British** imports.

* The duty on apparel- most of our imports of which come from Great Britain - has been increased from 25 to 40 per cent., whilst there has been an increase in the duty on galvanized iron and other **British** products.

* The rest of the **British** Empire supplies 63 per cent, of Australia's imports, while we send to other parts of the Empire 61 per cent, of our total exports.

* I do not believe that anything was intended beyond this : There may be a. hope - I believe there is a hope - on the part of the **British** Government that as the years go on some means may be found - some practical means - by which in matters of external defence the mother country and the outlying territories of the Empire may be brought together in some system of representation.

* Isented to us by the **British** Government.

* that all Australian-born children are **British** subjects; 
Australia, are not **British** subjects unless their parents are naturalized, and that the children of aliens who keep their nationality preserve their nationality in spite of Australian birth.

* Seeing that the subsidy we are paying  200,000  a year) is such a small one in comparison with the immense expenditure of the Mother Country on her Navy, and is really of very little consequence, as has been frequently said by leading **British** statesmen in Great Britain, I think we could better serve the interests of the Empire by turning our attention to the building up of our Navy.

* Why should not the name of an Australian sailor be equal to that of '"a **British** sailor?

* Free **British** and European immigration.

* The early removal from the Federal statute1 book of all provisions which prevent the free access to Australia of white **British** and European citizens and their families, whether with or without capital, provided they are healthy in body and mind, and apparently capable of earning their livelihood.

* Wc have no need of any such system in Australia, or anywhere else in the **British** Empire.

* He is Emperor of India, but King of the **British** Dominions.

* But one must remember that the Ministers of the **British** Empire have an immense amount to do.

* I think that the use of the words " **British** subjects," without a proper definition, would be too broad a provision.

* It would apparently cover all **British** subjects.

* When the right honorable member for East Sydney was in England as Premier of New South Wales, and the politicians of the Old Country were desirous that Australia should contribute more largely to the defence of the Empire, he pointed out that our citizens are engaged in developing an immense territory where the **British** flag is flying, and that trade follows the flag : that Australia is making markets and immense trade for Great Britain.

* Australia cannot do what **British** and European countries have done in the way of providing military and naval defence.

* I believe that the jingo feeling of the **British** race is sufficiently strong in the Commonwealth to induce the people to swallow this scheme with all the expenditure involved.

* The **British** people possess the pluck necessary for a warrior race, but when they are asked to defray what they believe to be unnecessary expenditure, they at once cry out for retrenchment.

* Great Britain is forced to keep pace with the Continental movement, and were it not for this fact it would be impossible to awaken the **British** people sufficiently to the gravity of the situation to induce them, to expend on defence the amount of money they are now prepared to expend for that purpose.

* We shall do all that is required if we assist in the establishment not of an Australian Navy, but of an Australian unit of the **British** Navy, in the maintenance of the supremacy of one great navy to defend one trade - that is Imperial **British** trade.

* The suggestion is that we should make these duties applicable to guns bearing the **British** or other approved test mark.

* Is there a **British** test mark?

* If the officers committed any error they are, and so is the **British** Government.

* From the report of the recent Royal Commission, we find that the **British** Army possessed no uniforms except those used for show purposes ; and that is exactly the position we have been in in Australia.

* At the outbreak of the South African war, the **British** soldiers, we are told, were absolutely without boots, and this recalls a similar state of affairs at the time of the Crimean war.

* I do not think there should be any waiting for information about a new weapon ; I have no great faith as to any recommendation from **British** authorities.

* If the population of Australia is likely to become 100,000,000 within a little over a century, we must ask ourselves, in the interests of the whole **British** race, what is to be the character of this future Australian people?

* If we admit races of another civilization, we are likely to have a mongrel breed, thoroughly out of sympathy with the aspirations of people of the **British** stock, and Australia will then be no friend of Great 
Britain in her hour pf need and trouble.

* We have had kings in England who were statesmen, and statesmen of the **British** race who were kings.

* It also meets the views of a large number of honorable members who desire that the men employed on subsidized ships shall be white, but at the same time do not want to exclude other white men who do not happen to be **British** subjects.

* jurisdiction to legislate in regard to 
**British** ships outside the Commonwealth.

* I should not have felt that this question was so important if it had not been foi' the remarks made by the Attorney-General in regard to the **British** veto.

* I must say, when we have the people of the Commonwealth, the majority of honorable members of the committee, the Government itself, and the acting leader of the Opposition, in favour of the principle contained in the amendment, that to find a Minister threatening honorable members with the veto of another Government which has no responsibility to us- 
That is the position which I understood the Attorney-General to take up ; that this committee should not do what it thinks to be right, but that it should consider the possible veto of the **British** Government, and the delay which would be thereby caused.

* I am going to vote for the amendment, and I hope it will be carried, because I consider that in -addition to the advantage which the amendment possesses over the original proposal, it will possibly bring us face to face at once with the question of the **British** veto.

* The House of Lords and the House of Commons fought it many years ago, with the result that there is now no veto of the **British** Parliament.

* If we have to fight the **British** veto, if we have to say that we shall not submit to a Colonial Secretary vetoing our Acts, we cannot have a better -or more popular cry upon which to act than  this very proposal which is being put before the committee by the honorable member for West Sydney.

* He represents the King, and if the King  personally  elected to veto this measure I do not  suppose  there would' be very much objection, because we could cure that veto in very much the same way as the **British** Parliament cured the veto of their measures, by refusing to grant supplies.

* This has been done to a great extent in the **British** Solomons, and could be done in the New Hebrides without any real difficulty, if they were once annexed or partitioned.

* Australia has certainly little right to talk, since she has, of recent years, practically ruined **British** trade in the New Hebrides, by imposing heavyduties on all island produce that enters her ports.

* A pressure of an unobtrusive sort has been put upon **British** colonists of late.

* It is greatly to be regretted that Australian and **British** settlers should find themselves under such disabilities as to be practically compelled to become Frenchmen.

* Duties are in his favour, instead of against him, subsidies help him out, enemies become friends - the astonishing thing is that the **British** colonists, so far, have taken next to no advantage of this state of things.

* Successful as some of the New Hebridean planters have been, one cannot  conscientiously  recommend **British** youth to emigrate to these islands at present.

* I venture to say that it would not be very long, under such conditions, before this Parliament became one of the most degraded Parliaments in the **British** Dominions.

* It was drawn up in a manner that is foreign to the spirit of the **British** Dominions.

* They do not ask the **British** people to tax themselves to put money into our pockets.

* I consider that he has done more than any other Englishman to consolidate the **British** Empire.

* One of the charges that has been levelled against **British** colonization has been that, when Englishmen went to civilize a country, they took the Bible in ohe hand and the whisky bottle in the other.

* Bay spoke about Australia floating loans at 3 per cent., but theconsols of the great **British** nation, bearing, interest at the rate of 2 J per cent., stand' to-day at only 82 or 83.

* They sent millions of dollars into 'Canada for the purchase of **British** securities, and to feed **British** soldiers who were burning property on the frontier.

* It would be easy enough to utilize the services of **British** consuls in all parts of the world to ascertain whether intending immigrants are desirable or not.

* Of course, it might be that the proportion of **British** coins coming to Australia might diminish the profits that we expect to derive from our local currency.

* It might be that **British** coins might come out here in such large quantities as to displace  a  considerable  proportion of our local currency, and thus diminish our profits in that connexion.

* He says, "These commoner articles in the window are too cheap," and his heart rebels against it, just as did the heart of the tory landlord against the idea of cheap food for the **British** people 50 years ago.

* It is not that the Victorian stock is not as good as that of the **British** stock in any part of the world.

* I want to refer to one or two remarkable expressions in the speech of my honorable friend the member for Gippsland, in which he described the commercial enterprise of Great Britain, which carries half the commerce of the world under the **British** flag, as a species of blackmail levied on the producers and distributers of the world.

* work of the **British** fleet is a work of distributing ; consequently, according to the honorable member, the work of the **British** mercantile fleet is blackmail.

* This service is rendered by the **British** fleet, because other nations cannot build their ships as cheaply as the **British** can.

* I look upon the work of the **British** mercantile fleets, even from a protectionist point of view, in carrying produce from the producer to the buyer, as one of the most magnificent services which the producers of the world can get.

* That is not the maxim of **British** merchants and capitalists.

* It is taken by the **British** merchant in his ships .

* The **British** people import 34,000,000 worth of cotton from America and other parts of the world.

* They supply the whole population of the **British** Isles with cotton goods, and yet they are able to sell in the world's market 67,000,000 worth of articles manufactured from the raw cotton.

* Are these gigantic industries, which send their products into the markets of the world to the tune of 60,000,000 a year, constructed by the pen and ink ingenuity of colonial or **British** politicians?

* Can we so devise our mechanical appliances that our machinery will be better than the **British** or German manufactories ?

* The first was when Australia voluntarily relieved the **British** Government of the extremely onerous duty of defending our important naval positions by declaring that she- would undertake that responsibility herself.

* Can we conceive what would have been the effect upon the public mind, and especially upon those European powers who were jealously watching the **British** operations in South Africa waiting anxiously for the defeat of the **British** Army, if Australia had assisted, the Empire by a cash contribution only  1  But instead, our sons of the soil sacrificed their lives in defence of the mother country.

* It represents only a ltd. per head of the population of the **British** Islands.

* Lord Brassey, who is certainly an expert on naval matters, stated that he agreed with very many eminent **British** admirals that Australians ought to be allowed to contribute to the Imperial defence in a way that suited themselves.

* If this were done, we should have  a fleet  to guard Australian home interests, whilst the Imperial fleet outside would destroy any sea-wolves preying upon **British** commerce.

* Another point which we have to consider is, that by the adoption of the course suggested by Captain Creswell we should avoid the jealousy which would be created by the payment of two distinct  rates  of pay to **British** and Australian sailors on the same ship.

* But one of the parts of this Bill is unprecedented in the history of legislation in any Trade Marks Act that has ever been passed in any part of the **British** Empire.

* I have here Quick and Garran:s excellent work on the Constitution, and at page 598 the effect of descriptions in cases in Eng land of the expression "trade mark" is given in a very succinct way - 
If the object of the Bill is realized - and I do not for a moment say that it will, because we have remembrance that not very long ago the **British** Parliament passed an Act providing for the branding of German-made goods, so that they should not under-cut **British** manufactures, and that, instead of that Act putting down the German article, it advertised it so enormously that it is now more sold than ever before.

* We are also in communication, through the High Commissioner of the West Pacific, with the **British** Resident in the Solomon Islands, and the **British** Resident in the New Hebrides, from whom we have asked the specific information what is proposed to be or can be done when repatriation commences in the groups over which they have charge.

* As the papers have been laid on the table, it is not necessary for me to do more than refer to them; but, perhaps, I may remind those who have not read them that the terms of our cablegram to the **British** Government with reference to Natal were as follows: - 
This is a remarkable invention by a member of the Defence Force.

* Sergeant Matthews has already offered his patent to the Commonwealth Government, but has been told by the Minister of Defence that it cannot be accepted unless the **British** Government approve of it.

* The **British** Government have entered into a- contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company to provide us with a1 fortnightly service.

* But under the new arrangement, the Orient Company was to give us a fortnightly service to and from England, and the **British** Government was to provide for a similar one.

* The Peninsular and Oriental Company will continue to give us a fortnightly service, by arrangement with the **British** Government, but we shall be forced to resort to the poundage system in order to get over the difficulty in regard to a weekly service.

* If we agree to the proposed vote, the money will be paid really to the **British** Board of Trade, which now conducts the Institute.

* Doubtless, if the **British** Government had to pay us for any advantages derived from Australian research, we ought to adopt an item of this kind; but, as a matter offact, the work carried on by the Board of Trade at the Imperial Institute is more particularly for the benefit of English trade and commerce as represented by, say, Manchester and Birmingham.

* When the authorities of the **British** Army obtained samples of brandies they were unable, of course, to think of purchasing the high-priced French brandy to which I have just referred.

* But we have the strange spectacle presented to us that those who come here to make their way in the world, and who have prospered, go about decrying Australia, so that they have made its name odious to **British** people.

* The consequence is that there is an, impression in the minds of **British** people to-day, as we hear from reliable sources, that the **British** immigrant coming to Australia, is in danger of being gaoled, instead of welcomed as a settler.

* Are we to treat those people as a branch of the **British** Empire?

* High Commissioner unless and until there has been handed over to the Commonwealth the complete control of the finances of both States and Commonwealth, so far as borrowing operations on the **British** market are concerned.

* I have here a paper, "Correspondence relating to **British** New Guinea," which has beenprinted since this resolution was arrived at, but the particulars which the House ordered should appear, are not given.

* That in the opinion of this meeting the policy of the **British** Government is approved, of by all loyal South Australians.

* I believe that a representative of South Australia in tins Parliament has expressed disapproval of some of the actions of the **British** Government in connexion with the present wai-, and are we to call in the aid of the military to declare that he is a disloyal subject?

* But the advertisement clearly shows- 

 Mr. THOMSON (North Sydney).In regard to sub-clause (J), I would like tosay that if we accept the permission granted by the **British** Government to mint silver, there might be a return of money minted in the Commonwealth if it were not of the proper weight.

* If of course **British** coin is regarded as foreign, it would be proper to weigh it, and there might be reason to declare it prohibited.

* I do not know whether the **British** working classes would consent to the sacrifice, or whether the colonies would consent to modify their Tariffs.

* ; and in the United States, od.- Is there any evidence there that **British** workmen are worse off than those of other countries ?

* in **British** vessels.

* In 1900 our **British** exports increased to 283,000,000, or an increase of 57,000,000.

* Those statements show that there is no evidence of the decadence of **British** trade.

* No, but they are trying to reverse the policy which **British** statesmen have followed with remarkable success for the last 50 years.

* Is there in those figures any evidence that the productions of German workmen are displacing in the English markets the productions of **British** workmen  1  The Board of Trade report says - 
The importations into Great Britain consist largely of raw material which comes from America, Germany, the colonies, and other countries, to be made up by **British** workmen, and re-exported very largely to the countries of original production.

* Now, looking at the other side we find that the manufactured goods worked up by **British** workmen - paid at higher wages than continental employes, and working for a smaller number of hours per day - and ex-  ported from England, represented a value of 234,7S9,389.

* These figures are taken from the official returns of the Board of Trade, and the position in regard to Germany is summed up as follows : - - 
The condition of the **British** Empire is so satisfactory to-day, and the progress she has made during the last 50 years has been so marvellous, that it is extraordinary to find a man like  Mr. Joseph  Chamberlain contemplating such a leap in the dark as has been indicated by recent cables.

* We have in this stage of our development a large number of men in the interior of this country - men who have been shooting kangaroos, who have been used to the rifle, and who for the purposes of the war in South Africa were the very best material that the **British** Army could possess.

* We ought to lay down the principle that Great, Britain is to defend our shores against invasion ; but I think there might be means adopted by which a larger number of our young men could be introduced to the 
**British** Navy, and by which we should have the right to the nomination of a very much larger number of cadets, under reasonable examinations, every year.

* But seamen, unlike volunteers, cannot be made in a few days, and it would be a good thing if the Commonwealth Government considered the  necessity  of purchasing a training ship, and the possibility of creating material for the navy, even if that material at the present time went over to the **British** Government.

* But if we ask the **British** navy to defend our 8,000 miles of Australian shores, we ought to be ready to second that navy in its efforts.

* I would remind those honorable members that, not long since, we thought we were minding our own business when we supported the **British** Government in the Soudan, and a little later we imagined that we were attending to our own business, and were interested in the permanence and prosperity of the Empire when we despatched troops to South Africa.

* I understand that the leader of the Opposition is vice-president of the **British** Empire League, in Sydney, and I am a member of the executive of the Imperial Federation League, which is working along the same lines to bring about the permanent unity of the Empire.

* training the ordinary **British** soldier is considered to be fit to go into the ranks and to be capable of doing anything which any other soldier may do, and yet we are asked to believe that, because an "officer has been trained in the Imperial Army, he is superior to one who has received his military education here.

* In the very early days of the South African campaign the opinion was expressed - and, no doubt, it was engendered by feelings of patriotism - that the Boers would immediately be crushed ; that they could not withstand the superior discipline of the **British** Forces.

* In the Broken Hill South Mine the duty would mean an added cost of ,1,653; U1 Broken Hill Block 10 an increase of [846 ; in the **British** Broken Hill an increase of 620; in Broken Hill Block 14, .300; in junction North, .320; in.

* I know that he attaches very great importance to the retention by the Commonwealth of the control in time of war of the proposed local' flotilla, and it may, be that, if he finds that the **British** naval authorities will not thank us for naval cooperation unless We are prepared to put our fleet under the control of the CommanderinChief, he  i.will  hesitate about constructing the vessels.

* I intended to ask him yesterday to allow us to see the further correspondence ' between himself and the **British** naval authorities, so that we might know whether they would welcome, or even accept, our co-operation unless given complete control in time of war.

* When the **British** Government had once explained why such action had been taken the matter would have ended.

* We know that already there is a **British** sphere of influence in China, but we do not know that a portion of China, in a few years, may not have become **British**.

* I believe that the **British** Government would readily consent to our accomplishing our purpose in what we believe to be the most effective way.

* But, if we keep the race pure, and build up a national character, we shall become a highly progressive people of whom the **British** Government will be prouder the longer we live and the stronger we grow.

* I wish to know whether the Government will invite the **British** Government to send a special representation of its navy, so that there may be a combined naval demonstration, in Australian waters ?

* If we are to be told that those in the **British** Possessions, who compete with us, are actuated only by such' selfish feelings towards Australia, what is ali this cant about Imperialism, and as to extending the range of sympathy throughout the **British** Empire, by establishing trade relations at the mutual instance of the various citizens of that Empire?

* According to statements made a few months ago in the public press, the importations of the International Harvester Company into Australia were equal to about only onetenth of trie importations of this class of agricultural machinery from other parts of the **British** Dominions.

* It is a little too bad that the Bill should have been framed to strike a blow at an import trade about 70 or 80 per cent, of which comes from -**British** Possessions, and mostly from the mother country.

* The New Zealand Act, I think, does not apply to **British** goods.

* I have such a regard for the true Imperialism at which we should aim, and such a feeling of kinship with the people of the **British** Islands, that I hesitate to agree to a measure to which only a few hours' consideration can be given, prohibiting, their importations.

* The Bill is not only unfair to the **British** people with whom we are allied in blood, but it is also unfair to our local merchants.

* All I wish to point out is that the Argentine may largely challenge us in the markets of the world, and particularly in the markets of the **British** Empire, to which this Bill is mainly directed.

* The bulk of the imports which will be affected by this Bill come from **British** Possessions.

* No; but Canada is a **British** Possession, and there are trusts and combinations there.I have heard some complaints made against the MasseyHarris Company, which is a Canadian concern.

* At all events, the competition of the Massey-Harris Company has been largely complained of, and the Bill aims at stopping, not only American imports, but also at putting an end to the competition of men who are **British** subjects like ourselves.

* It is therefore repugnant to **British** justice.

* We give pensions because persons are in need, and being **British**-born or naturalized **British** subjects, have lived in the country for twenty-five years and paid taxes ; and, to my mind, it is a distinct blot on.

* That in itself is repugnant to ordinary **British** fair play.

* The leader of the Opposition has told us that we are quite safe under the **British** flag, that so long as we remain part of the **British** Empire there is no need to fear, and that the consideration of this question should be delayed, as there is no need to take any action.

* I desire to refer now to the question of the supremacy of the **British** Empire.

* What is the position in regard to **British** battleships that have been "scrapped"?

* In showing their willingness to be in front of the Mother Country in their manner of taking a man's part in the protection of their homes and in the endeavour to help maintain the great Empire to which we all belong, they are setting a worthy example, not only to the Mother Country, but to the whole of the **British** Empire.

* The imports were almost wholly **British** and foreign produce, only 345 cases out of 95,243 containing the Australian article.

* The **British** citizen, no doubt, has many failings, but he is the best we.

* **British** control ; and the last' view is, that we might ratify the proposed agreement, reserving to ourselves, as we necessarily must, for our future consideration as a Parliament, any scheme of Australian local defence supplemental to or in substitution of the present arrangement.

* The second possibility is the one that is advocated by the opponents of the Bill - namely, that we should commence and look forward to the early establishment of a purely Australian Navy, entirely independent of **British** control.

* There have been suggestions made, both in the House and out of it, that we should borrow ships from the **British** Government - that in effect we should say to the **British** Government - " We desire to establish an Australian Navy, entirely independent of you ; and for that purpose we come to you to advance us the means of carrying out the scheme ; we do not directly ask you for your money; but we do something more - we ask you for what you have purchased with your money ; you have ships that you undoubtedly would not have built if you had not thought them necessary for the defence of the Empire, and we want to borrow those ships from you, with your guns on board, in order to mark our independence of **British** control."

* It seems very difficult to imagine a purely Australian Navy, composed of purely **British** ships, armed with purely **British** guns, with the proviso thatif an enemy appears anywhere but in the immediate proximity of Australia, those **British** ships are not to stir a single league, and those **British** guns are not to fire a single shot, to defend the honour, or maintain the supremacy, of the **British** flag.

* Thatseems to me to be an impossible position - a position that Australia could not consistently seek to create, and one that the **British** Government would scarcely dream of granting.

* That is the necessary advocacy of those who say we should establish an Australian Navy by borrowing **British** ships.

* But borrowing **British** ships, and saying that 'the **British** Government shall have no control over them without the consent of the Federal Government, is what I cannot understand.

* I do not want to mention names, but more than one honorable member has suggested that course; and borrowing has no meaning foi- the purposes of this discussion unless the ships are to befree from  thecontrol  of the **British** Admiralty.

* Under such circumstances, we should not have a purely Australian Navy to be retained in Australian waters at the will of the Commonwealth in time of danger, even though the **British** Admiral desired its presence elsewhere.

* We have never taken up the position that the squadron should, be entirely independent of **British** control - manned, officered, and commanded by Australians solely.

* We have never taken up the position desired by those who oppose the Bill, that there should be an Australian Navy, under purely Australian control, though composed of **British** ships, and armed with **British** guns.

* I was amazed to hear the extracts, which were written not from the Australian standpoint, but from the **British** taxpayers' stand-point.

* So that he assumes that our contribution under the existing agreement is to continue by progressively decreasing amounts until it vanishes, and I presume that the **British** fleet will vanish at the same rate as the contribution.

* We should have five ships, only second-class cruisers at their best, and some of which would be deteriorating, and if we did not have the full complement of the **British** ships on the station we should lose the additional protection that they would have afforded us.

* The great defect of the present agreement is rectified in that it is no longer a mere money contribution, because the new agreement gives us what is desired by the **British**' Government and the colonies - a personal interest in the navy  thatis  defending us.

* The agreement further insures to the Australian manhood an opportunity of cultivating and encouraging the maritime spirit that is plainly essential to national greatness in these days, and, more than that, it offers to Australians and New Zealanders opportunities of rising to the highest positions in the **British** naval service.

* Surely, when we consider the greater efficiency, and remember that at the end of ten years the ships, if of the second class, will be replaced by better ships at the expense of the **British** Government, do we not gain something in addition to the 150,000 a year that we save by adopting this agreement ?

* It seems to me that by such means we have embedded in our policy a personal interest in the **British** Navy, a means of educating those of our youth -who desire it in naval affairs, and all that at less cost - which is a very important matter to us at the present time - than would be involved in the only other scheme that presents any features of' practicability even on its surface.

* -I do not know whether the honorable member means to say that the ships of the **British** fleet are dingeys.

* We could pay the 200,000 and get the magnificent protection of the **British** fleet, and could also spend 150,000 a year towards the establishment of an Australian Navy.

* 1 am not so arguing ; but I am not going to be guilty of what I consider to be the unfairness to the **British** Government of saying to them - " We intend to be utterly independent of you, but we will take advantage of the position that you dare not be independent of us."

* Therefore, we cannot afford to take up the position that we can &lt;lo without the **British** Navy for our defence, or to think that with our enormous coastline of 8,000miles- ona portion of which, as I have already said, it is indispensable to have undisturbed sea communication - five second-class cruisers are going to do all that we desire for Australia.

* Are they prepared to allow any foreign power already in possession of the islands, such as the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, to carry out any policy they please n those islands without expostulation by Australia, and without an effort on the part, of the **British** Government ?

* Are we still to depend on the **British** fleet ?

* Thefigures  relating to the Commonwealth are as follows : - With United Kingdom, 50,582,000; intercolonial with Commonwealth, 27,264,000; with other **British** dominions, 11,675,000;.

* Does any honorable member mea.n to say that that indicates an intention on the part of the **British** Government to forget the interests of Australia and New Zealand ?

* I may be told that that is a piece of **British** testimony.

* A navy, as we are told, and especially the **British** Navy, does not wait skulking in a harbor in a position of defence.

* If an enemy declares that we must fight, the **British** Navy goes out, and looks for him, and undertakes what are called offensive operations.

* That is the traditional policy of the **British** Navy, but that is not war of aggression.

* I think that  no case whatever has been made out, and no case can be made out, for believing for an instant that this agreement will tie us to any aggressive policy on the part of the **British** Government.

* I should be perfectly prepared to trust to the **British** Admiral who kept it there, in the belief that he was doing what was best for Australia as well as for every part of the Empire.

* Honorable members may see in that work how every nation of any magnitude is hurrying to1 deserve the reproach, if it be a reproach, which Napoleon hurled at the **British**, that they were a nation of shopkeepers.

* For more than a century, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,and the Cape went on their toilsome way, carrying on the necessary work of pioneering and colonization, progressing in the manner that is now demonstrated, their efforts very often unappreciated, their importance unacknowledged, their destiny unperceived, their very existence frequently ignored; bub there came a moment, one signal moment, when in a flash, the flash of that red glare that lit up the fields of South Africa, there stood revealed, not only to England, but also to ourselves and the world at large, the unity in all essential particulars, of the great white nations that gather under the folds of the **British** flag.

* But the most unfaltering allegiance to Australia is not incompatible with that larger **British** citizenship to which we all aspire, and whatever our troubles or our triumphs - and no man can foretell them - I trust that the paths of ourselves and our brethren may so far run together that we may as Australians always proudly claim as a right to share in the perils and the glories of the united **British** Empire.

* If the honorable and learned member for Wannon makes further inquiries, he will, I believe, find that **British** ships trading along the coasts of New Caledonia are not as unhampered as he seemed to think when he spoke the other night.

* Therefore I shall vote against the inclusion of the proposed new clauses in this Bill, so that they may receive full consideration from the members of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill 
Therefore a Chinese who is a naturalized **British** subject, or a natural born **British** subject is entitled to the franchise in Queensland if he owns a piece of land of a certain value.

* Disqualifications under the Queensland Act are set out in section 8, which reads as follows :  - 
Is in the naval or military service of the **British** Empire or of Queensland on full pay; or 
Our coastal and harbor defences, if they were not supported by the **British** Navy, would be worth nothing.

* I believe that it will be necessary for us to issue interminable bonds - bonds resembling **British** Consols.

* It cannot be said that the Irish people have been unjustly treated so far as their representation in the **British** Parliament is concerned.

* Some time ago, when a redistribution of seats in the **British** Parliament was proposed, it was established beyond doubt that, in proportion fo population, Ireland possessed more representatives than England, and considerably more than Scotland.

* I maintain that during the past fifteen or twenty years the people of Ireland have received the very greatest consideration at the hands of the **British** Parliament, and even if I stand alone, I shall be found opposing any motion which contemplates interference by this branch of the Legislature in a matter in which we are not concerned'.

* We have too many shocking examples of the terrible neglect that has been too justly attributed to the **British** nation in this regard.

* The present proposal is to go beyond what was originally contemplated,' and to interfere with the shipping of the **British** Empire and of other countries to an unnecessary degree.

* We cannot shut our eyes to- the effect which a great deal of the legislation passed by us during the last three years has had upon the feelings of the **British** people, andi upon the minds of European peoples, as the work of an integral part of the **British** Empire.

* Who can doubt for a moment that the effect of our endeavouring to exercise jurisdiction, with regard to our laws, upon **British** ships, when they are upon the high seas, will be to cause suggestions to be made for reprisals upon Australian vessels when they reach England?

* I pointed out last night, and shall not now dwell upon the matter, the anomalous character of a policy by which, while foreign ships are given general opportunities, and have subsidies to help them to compete with our own ocean-going steamers for Australian trade, we not only abstain from giving equally substantial subsidies to **British** steamers, but actual^ seek to handicap them in the race, and so make their chances of success Jess than they were before.

* The Prime Minister last night seemed to recognise nothing more in these provisions than a proposal to legislate for foreign and **British** shipping alike.

* Surely the Government know that the moment that it is pointed out that this legislation is calculated to reduce the profits of foreign steamers the owners of those vessels will have no difficulty in inducing their respective Governments to increase their subsidies, and so place them once more at a great advantage over Australian and **British** steamers?

* Instead of being a proposal to give a preference to the motherland by establishing trade between us, it is practically an attempt to hamper the shipping industry of the **British** Empire in favour of the foreignowned steamers, which many people desire to see coming here much less frequently than they do.

* I think the vessels of the **British** India Company call there, as well as those of the E. and A.

* But although those needs are well and truly supplied by the two great companies whose steamers go out of their regular track to call at Hobart to collect- the fruit exported from that State, the article states the requirements of **British** markets for all forms of our produce.

* We should then have to build up again in the minds of **British** capitalists sufficient confidence to indues them to give us a line of steamers to 
Until the State of Western Australia is connected by railway with the South Australian railways, the carrying of passengers to and from!

* -Western Australia arid South Australia by any **British** ship, ordinarily carrying mails to or from any part of the Commonwealth, shall not be deemed engaging in the coasting trade.

* If the Governor-General is satisfied that any **British** ship, not registered in Australia, trades or intends to trade between different places in Australia, between Fremantle and Cape York, by way of Port Darwin, and that it is desirable in the interests of those places, or any one of them, for the said ship to trade, he may, by order, exempt the first-mentioned ship from all or any of the provisions of this part of the Act, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as he thinks fit to impose for any period not exceeding three years.

* He quoted, in support of that view, the opinion expressed by the **British** PostmasterGeneral, that if he were free to arrange the whole contract - that is, for the carriage of mails both to and from Australia - he would probably be able to secure an accelerated service at the same outlay that was being incurred under the old contract.

* As indicating that it was most unlikely that the **British** Postmaster-General would have been able to secure a renewal of the contract on the favorable terms he indicated, I would point to the statement, which, no doubt, honorable members have seen, as to the position of affairs of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which shows that they have been earning a very lo.w rate of profit for some considerable time past.

* The company would have been compelled to adopt some means to make its earnings yield a profit, and I cannot understand how the **British** Postmaster-General could have expected them to tender at the same rate as previously.

* But, incidentally, we are justified, when discussing the probability of the contract being renewed at the same price as formerly, and the question of accelerated speed, in looking at the position of the company; and when we find that for years they have been sustaining a loss, we may fairly assume that they could not have carried out the new contract on the conditions indicated bv the **British** Postmaster-General.

* The honorable member, in making that statement, apparently forgot that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company take up their Australian service as a part of their general Eastern service - as a part of the contract entered into with the **British** Government for the carriage of mails to and from India, China, and Australia.

* per mile of the consolidated contract ; and if the **British** Government had been prepared to pay the Peninsular and Oriental Company 4s.9d.

* I do not think that the **British** -AustralasianTobacco Company will sail through the Bill.

* He is filling in his time there until the **British** Army manoeuvres begin.

* Of course, it may be said that we can come to an arrangement with the **British** Government to undertake the defences of these outlying places.

* But seeing the temper of the **British** Government, so far as the administration is concorned, even the procedure I have indicated, would seem to involve a much larger guarantee on the part of Australia than is involved in the present understanding with Great Britain.

* They did it as long as they could, and I am indeed surprised, in view of notorious facts in history, to hear honorable members argue that protection of such a kind was of any advantage to the development of **British** industries.

* That is the statement that **British** agriculture has been ruined by free-trade.

* With regard to the assertion that **British** agriculture is ruined by free-trade, there is not the least doubt but that the good old times which the farmers and landlords talk about were put an end to by tlie abolition of the Corn Laws.

* By far the ugliest sign of the times is the fact that of late years two words which have for half a century been tabooed in **British** politics are now, after some whisperings and stealthy  hintings,  beginning to be spoken trippingly on the tongue.

* In some of the European countries, such as Italy, wages bear a very low ratio, indeed, to what is paid in Great Britain ; but we do not find that **British** workmen are suffering from the competition on the part of pauper labour.

* On the contrary, it has been shown beyond question, and I think admitted even by honorable members sitting behind the Government, that the position of the **British** worker under free-trade is steadily improving.

* Then, while **British** tourists are to be allowed to bring **British** silver here, and obtain face value for it, Australians visiting Great Britain, and taking with them silver coins, will have to pay discount on them.

* The best way to obtain an arrangement satisfactory to ourselves is to take power to proclaim **British** coins, other than gold, not legal tender.

* It is quite true that one of the names suggested brings back old memories, particularly to those who have followed **British** politics in times gone by, but I do not think that that is any reason for adopting the names of **British** statesmen in connexion with our Australian democracy.

* On the other' hand, if the **British** Government will not undertake the task of coining our silver for us under a similar arrangement to that which operates in the case of Canada, there is no reason why we should not get it done in the private mint of Birmingham, under the supervision of our own officers.

* We might say, with Walt Whitman - 
On Wednesday next it is proposed to hold public meeting support **British** policy in South Africa.

* Jla public meeting Wednesday next, support ing South African policy **British** Government, Minister directs that you should Confer with Premier South Australia and co-operate with him in every way so as to assist the object in view.

* If there has been any error, I take it that it has been caused by the Government, understanding the reference to the **British**, policy in South Africa to mean the passing of the ordinary patriotic resolutions, such as the members of the labour party supported a fortnight ago.

* Honorable members know that aniline dyes were a **British** discovery, and subsequently gave  rise to an enormous trade in England.

* How can the honorable member say that, when  I  have pointed out that the discovery was a **British** one, showing that the chemists in England were superior to German chemists ?

* But the circumstances of the **British** Empire now are such that, given, as we must admit there is, a desire on the part of each of the outlying dependencies to do its best to maintain the integrity of the Empire itself, we can rely upon each of those dependencies doing all in its power to relieve the Empire from any anxiety on its account.

* Apart altogether from the foolishness of our seeking to engage in every trivial contest that England has on hand, each **British**.

* They are counted as **British** people.

* I would point out to honorable members that as far as a navy is concerned there must be first of all a large initial expenditure, because a modern battleship costs at least 1,000,000, and those that are being laid down under the new programme of the **British** Admiralty are to cost a million and a-third.

* I am quite prepared to admit that as far as outside defence and the protection of our commerce is concerned, we ought to be prepared to make some contribution towards the maintenance of something like an efficient **British** fleet.

* It seems to me tli.it the question of providing ammunition in case of trouble is so important that we should not leave it to any private individual; We find that the **British** Government have found it necessary to increase the Governmental establishments with regard to the supply, not only of ammunition, but of arms.

* twenty batteries of guns which came from Germany only a little while ago during the South African war, and in many other respects the experience of the **British** Government has been the reverse of satisfactory.

* I am one who believes that **British** rule makes more for human advance and freedom than possibly any other rule.

* I recognise that in the **British** nation there ure some matters which should be dealt with by social reform, but I want Great Britain, as a nation, to occupy the foremost position in the world.

* These are men with whom I have been associated; and the training which astonished the **British** officers - the training which made them ready in camp life to do work which it was never expected men who did not belong to military organization would be able to do - was obtained in industrial warfare in the shape, of strikes in Australia.

* It was she who prevented war between Great Britain and the United States, when Mason and Slidell were taken by theKear  sage  off the **British** ship  Trent.

* Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, testified that the **British** 'Prime Minister was prepared to send troops to Canada and to commence a war, but the Queen stopped it.

* Members of the Opposition should not suppose that they are the sole representatives of loyalty to the **British** Empire.

* .- We should not depart from the inscription that now appears on the **British** coins.

* Do we find the **British** Government, when it comes to a question of principle, saying - "We stand, and prefer to stand, as the one living example of free-trade in the world ?"

* Ifhonorable members will read the most recent journals published in England - if, for instance, they will read the journal called  Commerce,  for last month, they will find that the Canadian woollen manufacturers are so affected by the competition of the lower paid **British** labour in their lines, that they have told their workmen that they must reduce their wages.

* The **British** Government have actually given a subsidy to steamers to go across between Bristol and Jamaica, and the first of the subsidized steam-ships, the  Morant,  left in May of this year.

* If we want a recognition of the encouragement of **British** industry as against the rest of the world, we have a recent example from the Throne itself.

* It was a private communication, and, as a matter of fact, I really do get fogged as between the two companies, seeing that the company, which is said to be in the interests of the Commonwealth, calls itself a **British** company, and the company, which is said to be against Australia, calls .

* I have to deal with only one moire function to be discharged in the proposed London office - I refer to the official relations between the Commonwealth and the **British** Government.

* On the one side we find that the site is fairly convenient for an' immigration office and for an office at which our official relations with the **British** Government may be conducted; but it is supremely inconvenient - it is about as unsuitable a locality as could be chosen - for functions which require an office quite as urgently as do the others to which I have referred.

* Is it a fact that we in Australia are justified in following the German- rather than the **British** example?- -  f want again to urge the Government to copy Great Britain.

* They were a **British** Minister and an American Under-Secretary, and they signed a little bit of a contract which led to the abolition of the warships that were on the lakes and the forts that were on the frontier.

* If that is to be the position why not rescind the whole scheme and vote  500,000  a year to the **British** Navy ?

* The Australian Tobacco firms were brought- into conflict by the establishment of Inter-State free-trade, and tha competition became more acute, owing to a section of the lmneri.il Tobacco Company, or **British** Tobacco Trust, having commenced to manufacture in Sydney.

* 'Although the English have been trading with the New Hebrides for upwards of twenty years, there are now only 245 **British** residents there, thirty-four of whom are missionaries.

* I suppose it is through the missionaries that the reports have filtered which have led the **British** Government to become indifferent about the islands.

* I learned that for eight years he practically had charge of the industry on behalf of the **British** Government, and ho has promised to send me several works that he has written upon the habits of fish in those waters.

* I cannot for the moment recall the exact details' of his appointment, but he was either an officer or the head of a Commission appointed by the **British** Government to deal with the scientific branch of the industry.

* He informed me that in  Mr. Dannevig  we have one of the best experts to be found in the **British** Empire.

* If we were justified in interfering in the affairs of the Transvaal when it was not a **British** possession, how much more title have we to do so now when it is.

* Up to 1899 we were told that the object which the **British** Government had in view was to give white men the franchise, and to make the Transvaal a place in which white men could live.

* I consider that our annual subsidy of 200,000 to the **British** Navy is a very paltry contribution, having regard to the benefits which we derive from it.

* My desire is that the vote shall not be applied with a view to diminishing the contribution that we make to the **British** Navy.

* I shall always consider that that contribution is a very moderate one, having regard to the great services rendered to us by the **British** Fleet.

* The amendment now before the Chair relates to the employment of white **British** seamen.

* The amendment relates exclusively to the employment of white **British** seamen.

* It may be quite right, as the Prime Minister has stated, that much of the private business on the notice-paper is simply of an abstract character, and that other of it cannot hope to be brought to a conclusion in a session of ordinary length.- But we have to remember that in all **British** Parliaments honorable members are extended certain rights in the form of opportunities to bring forward private business.

* When I submitted the resolutions I stated that all the preferences were to be granted conditionally upon the goods being carried in **British** ships.

* The honorable member said that  Mr. Chamberlain  wished to im.pose duties upon imports into Great Britain so as to strike a blow at countries which were imposing duties upon **British** goods, with the ultimate purpose of bringing about universal free-trade.

* I understand that these preferences are to be granted in the first place to **British** goods brought out in **British** ships.

* If we are going to extend this preference to **British** goods that were afloat in foreign ships when the motion was submitted, it seems to me that we should extend the same treatment to foreign goods which at the time were afloat in **British** ships.

* The Ministry is endeavouring to remedy an apparent injustice, but I should like to point out that, in addition to the consignees of **British** goods in foreign ships, foreign goods in **British** ships, and foreign goods in foreign ships, many .

* It is not as good as a member of the **British** Medical Association.

* He did not act within the intentions of Parliament or in accordance with the **British** principle that no man shall be punished without trial.

* Is it the **British** seamen, the foreign seamen, or those coloured natives of India and elsewhere, to whom they have meted out such peculiar treatment on previous occasions?

* less than 3,000 are of **British** birth.

* The Minister of External Affairs has informed us that if these clauses are carried the Government intend to introduce other clauses giving a preference to **British** vessels.

* Of what benefit would it be to **British** ships which at present do not suffer from the competition of the foreign lines to give them a preference over those lines in the Inter-State trade ?

* Consequently they are not in the slightest degree likely to enter into competition with **British** lines.

* Therefore, to talk of giving a preference to **British** companies is simply what is vulgarly called " rot."

* No preference can be given to **British** vessels in this respect, simply because there is no competition.

* Is it one that affects, not only the Transvaal, but also Australia and  other  portions of the **British** Empire?

* I recognise, as no doubt every honorable member does, that the presence of a large body of Chinese settlers there might at some future time become a menace to other portions of the **British** Empire, more particularly to Australia.

* I would remind the honorable member that it was within the power of the **British** Government to enlist men not only in Australia, but in any other part of the Empire.

* It is a curious fact, as has been noted recently by  Mr. Coghlan,  that we in Australia seem to suffer from a form of political disease that is absent in practically every other **British** community.

* Yet he declared that the fact that General Booth had to come to Australia to consult the Prime Minister before he could introduce **British** subjects into a **British** possession, was proof of the effect of our legislation.

* The conditions under **British** rule are the same in the North as in the South of Ireland.

* He appealed to them as lovers of their country, and as men anxious to lift her from the slough into which she had been reduced by the tyranny and oppression of centuries, to rally their forces together, and there, as in other parts of the country, make **British** "Government impossible, as the most effective means of ridding the country of the greatest curse that ever plagued a nation.

* Thus" we learn that **British** rule is to-day considered the greatest curse that ever  befel  a nation.

* I ask the honorable member for Coolgardie whether he thinks that the **British** Parliament to-day entertains the same opinion upon, this question as it did twenty years ago?

* They have joined that organization, not because they disagree with the religious beliefs of any particular section of the community, but because they fear that **British** sovereignty will be destroyed by clerical domination in 
I may be able to return the good turn done me by the honorable member when my action will not interfere with a policy of grave importance to Australia.

* I should like a duty of 15 per cent, to be im;posed upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture, and of 10 per cent, upon that of **British** origin, if I cannot get the duties for which I am now striving.

* Certainly, a person who has openly alleged to be the emissary of Standard Oil was lobbying most industriously, and there was a sudden and amazing falling away among those who wanted to reserve the Australian market for the **British** Company's oil, and the Four, regarding whom suspicion now stinks to Heaven, are said to have not only changed their own views, but to have toiled enthusiastically to make converts to the doctrine of free-trade for the Monopoly's oil.

* It was football and cricket that made the **British** soldier so worthy an exponent of the warlike art.

* I am informed that it consists of the **British** - Australasian Tobacco Company, the old States Tobacco Company, the old Cameron Tobacco Company - and I believe that there is a descendant of the original owner still living - the Dixson Tobacco Manufacturing Company, the American Tobacco Company, and Wills. '

* The other night, when I described this provision as a socialistic sop, the Prime Minister promptly replied that a similar provision was included in the contracts made by the **British** Government.

* His  interjection was, " The **British** Government also include it."

* In the meantime, I propose to make our contract harmonize with the provision which is embodied in the **British** contracts at the present time.

* The more immigrants of the right sort, **British** people for preference, that we can get, the less room we shall leave for the occupation of any of our territory by possibly undesirable immigrants.

* One of the first steps taken to advertise Canada was the offering of medals to the State school children of England for the best essay on the 
Colonel FOXTON.- The Queensland Government, under a penalty of 4 per head for any shortage, have to insure to the **British**- India Company, to which th~ey 
The sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland.

* Those who are responsible for the motion say in one sentence that the Imperial Par-;, liament is eminently just, and anxious to deal with the question of Ireland's wrongs, and in another that no **British** Parliament can deal with the question.

* Are honorable members sincere when they say that they have observed in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom " a sincere desire now to deal justly with Ireland, " and add that "no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland " ?

* If that opinion be indorsed by the Tariff Commission, I hold "that it will not make any appreciable difference to the Australian artisan whether his employment is taken from him as the result of the competition of **British** goods, or of the competition of foreign goods.

* If goods continue to be imported to his detriment, what consolation will it be to him, if thrown out of work, to know that they are of **British**, instead of foreign origin?

* My point is that if we adopt a scheme of preferential trade wilh Great Britain at the present juncture, we may adopt one which will permit of the introduction of goods manufactured by **British** sweaters to the displacement of our own artisans.

* But,, irrespective of whether or not his statement be correct, the proposal of the Government does not increase the duties hitherto collected upon goods of **British** origin.

* Seeing that an Imperial Conference will he held in London next year, at which the Commonwealth' will be represented, I think that we should defer action in this matter with a view to affording our representative an opportunity  to  discuss with **British** statesmen the possibility of a reciprocal treaty being entered into between the United Kingdom and Australia.

* I am perfectly prepared to support a reciprocal agreement between the Commonwealth and any portion of the **British** Empire whose artisans observe similar conditions to our own, when we have the information to hand' which will enable us to do justice to the Australian manufacturer.

* Does it concern the Australian workman whether the goods which cause him to lose his employment are of **British** or foreign origin?

* If complaint were made tomorrow by a boot manufacturer that' his industry was being interfered with by the competition of **British** goods, some honorable members would at once cry out, " Let us issue new preferential proposals."

* We ought to be thoroughly seised of the effect which **British** imports have upon Australian industries.

* I have not yet been able to obtain the information I desire in regard to the allegations made by the Perry Fuse Manufacturing Company, that the Australian industry is likely to be seriously affected by the action of a **British** combine.

* I have clearly pointed out to my constituents that under no consideration would I vote for proposals that would be advantageous to coloured workmen, even although they might be resident in some part of the **British** Empire.

* .1 know that it could hardly be said that the words " United Kingdom " could be so construed as to cover the product of coloured labour in India and other **British** Possessions ; but I would point out that, owing to her defective immigration laws, England's large alien population is rapidly increasing.

* Although the number of foreign vessels commencing their voyage to Australia from a **British** port may be, as alleged by  Senator Pulsford,  only eleven, the fact remains that his table does not apply to vessels which commence their voyage from a foreign port, and proceed  via  **British** ports to Australia.

* There are more than eleven French and German mail steamers annually calling at Australian ports, and a number of German tramp steamers, on their way to Australia, touch, at **British** ports, and take in cargo for delivery here.

* In view of the necessity of protecting the **British** mercantile marine, we should give a preference only to vessels complying with certain conditions.

* According to figures collected by a Committee of the **British** House of Commons appointed to consider the position of the **British** mercantile marine, in i860 there were employed on **British** ships 157,000 **British** seamen and 335 Lascars, while in 1903 the number of **British** seamen was only 176.000. and the number of Lascars 41.000.

* Furthermore, in j 903 there were 40,000 foreigners, in addition to Lascars, or 81.000 foreigners and Lascars, out of 176,000 seamen employed on **British** ships.

* Having considered them, we should be prepared to show consideration to the **British**, and.

* I do not think that we can accept this agreement until we know the views of the Imperial Conference, and obtain additional reports from the Tariff 
I remember reading in all the newspapers throughout the Commonwealth a short time since, expressions of admiration of the way in which the **British** seamen assisted in the defence of Ladysmith.

* If the **British** sailors showed their loyalty to the Empire on that occasion, let the Commonwealth now show its loyalty to them by allowing them an opportunity to earn a livelihood.

* I think that in the clause which the PrimeMinister is to bring down there ought to be a condition that neither an arrangement with the **British** Government nor a contractwith a mail steamer should be completed until it has been laid before Parliament and approved by it.

* But we desire, at the same time, to preserve a **British** Australia.

* Presumably they are all **British** subjects.

* I sincerely hope that the heroic method will be adopted on this occasion, and that we shall let it be understood in a graceful manner that we intend to have a white Australia, and to exclude all coloured aliens from our shores, irrespective of whether or not they happen to be **British** subjects.

* In unsettled  communities  such as **British** New Guinea men will exercise their preferences, and if they cannot obtain land in the way that they desire they will probably take none.

* I would hesitate very much to lay down any one system in such a way that if persons would not take up land under it, **British** New Guinea would remain largely unoccupied, and its progress would be stagnated.

* The ordinances, with the exception of some of the later ones, are contained in a publication entitled  The Laws and Ordinances of **British**  New  Guinea,  which is to be found in the Library.

* I have not heard a single complaint as to the blacks being supplied with liquor in **British** New Guinea.

* In the **British** House of Commons, notwithstanding the strong party feeling there, defence matters are never discussed from the party point of view.

* It was pointed out in one of the reports that if the **British** Government had taken timely action by sending a sufficient number of troops to South Africa in the early stages of the dispute with the Transvaal Government, the war might have been prevented.

* There was undoubtedly room for improvement in nearly every branch of the **British** military organization.

* The Treasurer will agree with me that the only designation that His Majesty the King possesses to-day is that of King of Great Britain and the **British** Dominions beyond the seas and Emperor of India.

* Certainly, but no **British** coins can rightly _ bear the inscription " Emperor of India."

* The **British** Parliament would not permit the King to be spoken of as " Emperor of Great Britain and Ireland."

* But the announcement was not received enthusiastically in the **British** House of Commons.

* Such an inscription might very properly be used in some of the other Dominions before the King received his "added title of King of the **British** Dominions beyond the Seas.

* The honorable member said that he did not, first of all, proceed to England with the object of obtaining **British** labourers for the cane-fields.

* His  efforts, however, were blocked bv an intimation from the **British** Emigration agent that emigrants would be warned against going out to work in the cane-fields of Queensland.

* The private individuals who at present are the creditors of Queensland and South Australia, do not ask for any such security; they do not seek to step in and collect the railway revenue, or revenue derived from any other source, but simply take the facts as they stand, and depend on am honest **British** community to meet the interest whenever it falls due.

* By such means we should, at any rate, be always steadily moving in the direction of consolidating the debts, and reducing the cost of interest, and, further, always moving in the direction of establishing a sinking fund and gradually extinguishing our indebtedness 
No; it was not due to Federation; but was caused by the operation of the stupid arrangement entered into by the **British** Government, and we are following a similar course.

* We should either produce something from New Guinea, and make the Territory play an important part in the **British** Empire, or we should relinquish our hold upon it.

* Contrasted with what the French and Germans are accomplishing in their colonies, with what the Dutch, or what the **British**' are doing in Sarawak, and with the operations of the North Borneo Company, which is developing similar territory at a very rapid rate, and making it a national asset for the race, our efforts have been poor indeed.

* I drew attention to this subject upon 9th October, 1903, when I asked the present Prime Minister - 
Under the Customs Union, which came into force on the 15th August, 1903, intercolonial freetrade between the **British** Possessions in South Africa became law, and by removing every Customs barrier facilitated the free interchange of commodities of the parties to the Union, and was the first important step to a future federation of South Africa.

* Certain goods were also placed in a special class, on which a duty of 2^ per cent, extra is levied if of foreign manufacture, and which are admitted duty free if of **British** origin.

* Provision was also made to extend the preferential rate to any **British** Colony granting reciprocal privileges to the members of the South African Customs Union, and 'I would respectfully suggest for your consideration that it would be of -advantage to Australia to join in this system of reciprocity.

* It was that we should arrange with the banks to collect the current silver, 'and export it to their agents in other **British** communities where such coinage was used, and then supply the banks with a corresponding amount of coinage issued by the Commonwealth mints.

* According to a short telegram in  The Times,  he referred to the question of entering into a reciprocal arrangement with South Africa, and then proceeded to say - 
While Australia is circulating **British** money, Canada is circulating the money of the United States - 
I ask the present Government whether they cannot follow the example of Canada in this regard.

* Canada is making a similar substitution, only that she is sending the coins to the United States, whereas we should have tosend the coins to other **British** Possessionsin which they are used.

* I do not suppose that the field of Aldershot, where the whole of the **British** Army is manoeuvred, consists of more than 2,000 acres.

* The Minister has said that he requires a tract of country fifteen miles square to permit of the troops of one State being manoeuvred, notwithstanding that not a quarter of that area is required to manoeuvre the whole **British** Army.

* Every representative, whether in a **British** Parliament, or the German Parliament, should strive for peace ; and I am quite sure that the **British** Government are not anxious to precipitate war.

* Let us imitate the **British** Government and not hesitate to say that if necessary they shall pay a heavy tax upon incomes.

* The **British** market absorbs tens of thousands of pounds worth of butter produced on one of the Danish settlements.

* I should think that under the **British** flag every Government possesses such power.

* **British** law that the land and the minerals in it belong to the Crown.

* We see that the **British** race is cramped in its own islands, and has to send its surplus population abroad, to the United States, Canada, and other places. '

* It behoves us, as Australians, to look after the development and future of the Northern Territory, and not to rely too much on the **British** authorities in the matter.

* .The better class of companies are those who do not only local business, but also business over a greater part of the **British** Dominions.

* We hear a great deal of the desire to strengthen Australian relations in the Pacific, but in the whole history of **British** settlement there is nothing more pathetic or more disgraceful than the manner in which Australia has practically driven the New Hebrides and other Pacific settlements away from all social and trading intercourse and sympathy with herself.

* One canread how splendidly loyal the Islanders have been towards the **British** and Australian connexion, when their every directand pecuniary interest lay in throwing in their lot with the French settlers and the French Government, who give them enormously greater facilities for trade than does Australia.

* There is nothing more deplorable in the whole history of **British** settlement than the present condition of affairs, not only in the Northern Territory, but in the whole of the northern provinces of Australia.

* That the following proviso be added : - " Provided that on stripper harvesters the product of white labour in any section of the **British** Empire, the duty shall not exceed  10  per machine."

* If my proposal be carried, the result will be that upon stripper-harvesters imported from any country other than a part of the **British** Empire, and upon harvesters which are imported from any portion of the Empire and which have not been exclusively constructed by white labour, the -duty will be  jQi2,  whereas machines imported from any part of the **British** Empire which have been exclusively constructed by white labour, the duty will be  10.

* They strike onealmostas a voicefrom the dead - as the voice of a man who has been suddenly awakened after sleeping, say, a quarterof a century, and who is under the impression that in these days we are still followingthe constitutional lines followed by our forefathers in the **British** Parliament.

* The Prime Minister pointed out, as he had a right to point out, that in consequence of our Imperial connexion and the difficulties that are likely to arise in regard to **British** subjects, it became necessary to frame the Bill in a way that was not exactly palatable to himself, and it certainly is not palatable to a large section, if not the whole, of the honorable members of this House.

* They are engaging workmen of the best class to go to Japan and enter technical schools and colleges, as well as manufactories of various kinds, in order to teach the Japanese **British** methods of manufacture and production.

* Therefore, in a very short time we shall not only have these persons educated in **British** literary subjects, but in **British** arts and manufactures, and then that contract labour, to which the honorable member for Bland has referred, will be a much more serious question to us than it is to-day.

* These men, educated in **British** methods, having a full knowledge of the manufacture of goods calculated to sell in the markets of the Commonwealth, will be imported here under contract, at very low rates of wages, to compete in our own markets in the manufacture of those goods which hitherto have been exclusively made by our own people.

* As honorable members know, there are quite a number of towns in the United States in which German, Spanish, Italian, and French is spoken, but not the **British** language.

* She is already well aware of the sympathy which all Australia entertains with regard to the affairs of the Empire ; she knows full well that with respect to any matter with which she is Connected, Australia is with her heart and soul ; and when Australia makes this demand for her preservation, for the solidarity of the **British** people, for the successful establishment and the carrying on of a **British** nation in these southern seas, she will not refuse it.

* of which  115,000  worth is of **British** origin.

* There is the **British** Fleet, and there is the United States Fleet to protect US; because the American Navy Board has decided to keep fourteen battleships at the Philippine Islands continuously, and to have a fleet in the Pacific equal to any other there.

* Therefore, I propose that, instead of wasting our money on military expenditure, we should give  ^100,000  a year to the **British** Fleet, and another  ^100,000  to the Yankees, and say to them, " You look out, and when the other chap is out fighting, take care of this place."

* of compensations, his duty being to distribute amongst the Boers the ,9,000,000 which the **British** nation, in the greatness of her generosity, chose to give those whose property had suffered during the w7ar.

* still vital in **British** finance, as high income taxes and heavy succession duties sufficiently attest.

* In 1882 a committee of the **British** Association found that 75 per cent, was the workingman's contribution to the revenue from beer and spirits.

* It has changed equally for the Mother Country ; indeed, for every portion of the **British** Empire.

* Much as he hoped that amity with the United States would be long continued, he declined to base the **British** naval policy upon pious hopes.

* The Pacific formed one-half of the world of water, and **British** interests in trade and commerce, and  out  hopes and aspirations for the future, were hugely in excess of those of every other nation in the world, and yet they were expected to hold that hemisphere with no primary base.

* It is to be feared the golden opportunity of facing the question of the **British** maritime position in the Pacific, and initiating a policy of co-operation to provide for its maintenance will bc lost.

* What is needed there, is a primary naval base for producing and sustaining **British** predominance of maritime power in that hemisphere.

* **British** commerce is world-wide, and the protection of our trade must therefore give us great concern.

* Mr. Haldane,  than whom Great Britain has not had a better War Minister, spoke in this way on the subject, only a little while ago - 
Those opinions found expression in the invitation to a Conference, issued by the **British** Prime Minister.

* It is expected, also, that our men and officers will be interchangeable, and, indeed, that they will be interchanged, throughout the **British** Navy.

* We expect to open up a career for our officers and men equal to that of the officers and men in any other part of the **British** Empire.

* This means that they will possess all the characteristics of **British** officers, that in swift mastery of circumstances, quickness of decision, the possession of resource, of the power of initiative, of courage, and of the ability to mould men, they must be proficient - in other words, that our officers must attain the same standard as **British** officers in respect of all those qualities for which those officers are conspicuous to-day.

* Our seamen will also be trained to the same standard of efficiency as has been attained by the **British** blue-jacket, which again is a very high one indeed.

* I am not discussing the question of whether the standard reached by **British** blue-jackets is higher or lower than that reached by our own naval men.

* If our men are the equal of the **British** men, so much the better.

* What is lacking in Australia is opportunity and encouragement - the acquirement of that training which has furnished the inestimable material of which the **British** Navy is composed to-day.

* I note that it has been condemned by the **British** authorities ; but, before accepting their decision as final, I should like to see it subjected to a thorough, practical test.

* We should rejoice in the knowledge that the **British** flag floats over Australia, and that she is defended by the **British** Navy ; but we must not forget that it is our duty to do something in our own defence.

* Whatever may have been the actual words used, the impression was evidently left on the mind of Lord Tweedmouth, and, I suppose, on the mind of the **British** public, that the Australian people had expressed views indicating that they were tired of the agreement, and desired to get rid of the expense of contributing towards the maintenance of the Imperial Navy in Australian waters.

* Mr. Deakin followed, speaking on the lines of his despatch to the **British** Government on August 28, 1905.

* event of a cruiser raid, Australia would possess the power of resistance in her own ports, also when the **British** squadron arrived she would be able to some extent to supply reinforcements.

* That objection would apply with still greater force to the whole scheme of preference, because we propose to place **British** manufacturers in a position of advantage over foreign manufacturers.

* It is important for lis to consider the extent to which, we may bring our influence to bear with the object of securing the manning of **British** vessels by white Britishers.

* It is desirable that present conditions should be improved, not  only  with a view to finding an additional outlet for **British** labour, but also with the object of providing a suitable reserve for the **British** Navy in time of war.

* Great Britain depends upon her naval forces to a far larger degree than upon her land forces for her defence ; and the necessity for increasing the number of **British**  seamen  employed in the mercantile marine was urged some years ago by no less an authority than Lord Brassey.

* He showed that the proportion of **British** seamen was rapidly decreasing - that it had diminished by 50 per cent, within a few years - and  that it  was likely to fall off still more rapidly in the near future.'

* But Lord Brassey points out that it is the keen competition of the foreign seaman, and his desire to obtain employment in the **British** mercantile marine, which are responsible for the displacement of the Britisher.

* From an authoritative statement which was recently made on the subject, I gather that there has been a verv rapid decline.- in the number of **British** apprentices employed in the **British** mercantile marine during recent years.

* I may tell honorable members that  twenty-five  years ago there were 250,000 **British** subjects employed as sailors in the **British** mercantile marine, whereas to-day there are only about 100,000.

* Only the other  day  I read a statement in one of the leading magazines that the foreign element has displaced the **British** in her mercantile marine to such an extent that it was possible for any considerable naval power to find within that marine sufficient men of its own to act as pilots in **British** waters in time of war.

* If it be wise to extend a preference to **British** as against foreign manufactures, surely  it is equally wise to extend a preference to Britishers who are engaged in the great maritime work of transportation, particularly when it is so intimately connected with the defence of the Empire.

* I am altogether opposed to the principle of preference as set out in this schedule, but if the Committee in its wisdom says- that a preference shall be granted to **British** goods, I fail to see why it should be granted to **British** vessels which are not exclusively manned by **British** subjects.

* Every **British** subject is entitled to hold whatever religious views he pleases, and in my opinion every man should have the right to give free expression to his religious beliefs.

* The subject is one that has been discussed again and again in the **British** Parliament, and has led to the defeat of more than one Ministry.

* It would be just as reasonable for the **British** Parliament, at a time when the Tariff Commission is taking evidence with regard to the fiscal issue, to send a message to this Legislature- requesting us to give a greater measure of free-trade to the people, as.it would be for us to request the **British** Parliament to grant a measure of Home Rule to Ireland.

* I should like to know what honorable members would say if .the **British** Parliament sent a message requesting us to establish the Federal Capital where the people of that State desire it.

* If such a message were received, I am sure that the House would ignore it, just as the **British** Parliament has from time to time ignored messages sent to it by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth.

* Considering that these are the views of men who have guided the affairs of the nation, it would ill become us to transmit such a message as this to the **British** Parliament in the absence of any mandate from the people of Australia.

* per ton upon iron imported in **British** ships into Great Britain to7 12s.

* When Rowland Hill ultimately induced the **British** Parliament to agree to the penny postage system, the volume of the trade of Great Britain was less than 200,000,000 - something like the trade which has already been established in Australia.

* The total estimated loss is 295, 586, though I am glad to say that the adoption of universal penny postage throughout the **British** Empire would mean an additional loss of only 20,924.

* The stipulation as to the weight of these materials gives a preference to the foreigner over the **British** manufacturer.

* Where the texture and quality are the same, piece for piece, foreign goods of this kind are always lighter than those of **British** make, and therefore the stipulation as to weight deliberately gives a preference to the foreigner.

* The stipulation as to weight tells in favour of foreign manufactured goods as against those of **British** manufacture, because the former are invariably lighter, while it will not give us the protection that we thought it would give.

* as will exclude **British** imports, we shall make no concession by increasing the imports against the foreigner.

* We can, however, give preference by reducing the duties upon **British** goods.

* If the foreigner is the outsider, and pays the duty, there can be no preference to Australia in the **British** market.

* Probably not 10 per cent, of the foreign import trade in the articles mentioned in the schedule will be "diverted into **British** channels.

* The plan which has been adopted by the Government marks such a departure from that which has been followed by other portions of the Empire, which extend a preference to the mother country by the simple expedient of reducing their duties to the extent of 33J per cent, upon **British** goods, that I expected the Minister would have assigned reasons for it when he submitted this proposal.

* Canada and New Zealand have granted a .much larger measure of preference to goods from the mother country than is here proposed; but, instead of developing **British** trade, there has been a decline of that trade proportionately to that done with other countries.

* In the first place, both New Zealand and Canada - and we are following their example - endeavoured so to protect their manufacturers against Britain itself, that when there was no concession made to **British** goods in respect of the duties levied under the ordinary Tariff, the higher duties imposed against the goods of other countries proved ineffective.

* Foreign goods subject to the higher percentages, will, in many cases, be introduced in parts into Great Britain ; the whole work of manufacturing will be practically done abroad, but the process of assembling these parts will take place in the "United Kingdom so that the complete article will be entitled to the preference granted to **British** imports.

* .- I am in favour of the adoption of decimal coinage, but I was informed that it would be unwise, if not almost impossible, to adopt it until the **British** Government decides to deal with the question as affecting the whole Empire.

* I got all the information I could on the question, and it seemed to me that the proper course to take was to continue our coinage, as we have it now, and, when the **British** Government decided to adopt the decimal coinage, to make such alterations as would- be necessary.

* I was glad to hear the statement of the Prime Minister that he is taking into consideration the question of production by **British** settlers in the New Hebrides, not only as regards coffee, but also as to other items in the Tariff.

* I am referring to **British** settlers.

* I think that, without injury to ourselves - in some cases with distinct benefit to ourselves - we could give consideration to **British** settlers in the Islands.

* Let me point out that although sugar does not grow in the United Kingdom, a preference is given in the case of **British** contectionery.

* Is that preference to be withheld in every instance in which 25 per cent, of **British** labour has not been employed?

* If this regulation be enforced, there will be not only enormous difficulty caused to the exporter and to the Department, but also an absolute departure from the decision at which we arrived, knowing that in the case of many articles 25 .per cent, of **British** or any labour was not employed.

* I know of an Australian who served in South Africa and was honoured by promotion to a position of commissioned rank in the **British** Army, but who, upon his return to Australia, was not allowed to retain the title which he had earned on active service.

* I would much rather that the word " **British** " were substituted for " Imperial" in sub-section (c) of this clause..

* I am aware that ancient documents show that Ireland is included in the term " **British** " as little Ireland.

* He quoted something which I said the other day, to the effect that I desire reciprocal trade throughout the **British** Dominions.

* The Government favour what is now proposed only as an instalment of preferential trade, the object being to give **British** manufacturers an advantage of 10, 12, or 15 per cent., or whatever the amount may be, as against their rivals in other parts of the world.

* The right honorable member for East Sydney, in referring to **British** countries, mentioned South America.

* **British** Navy, under an arrangement entered into at the invitation of the Imperial Government.

* the **British** Navy in these seas.

* We were told that the **British** Navy in these seas would be kept up at its former strength, and that the Imperial Government would give us an Auxiliary Australian Squadron which would be something altogether  apart from the **British** Navy.

* No doubt the object of this bit of paper, the primary motive of the agreement from the stand-point of the mother country - mind I do not at all say that it may not be a good one ; personally I do not think it is, but the Imperial authorities may have good reasons for their judgment - the object is, I think, to take off the aspect of an Australian agreement for an Australian naval force, and to substitute an Australian partnership in the **British** Navy the whole world over.

* I think that it is consistent with a feeling of absolute loyalty to the mother country and in the interests of the mother country itself to set myself strongly against any attempt to substitute for the independent action of these self-governing States an admission to share in the active management of the **British** Empire.

* **British** vessels to trade with the Marshall Islands, and, if so, can he inform the House as to the representations which he proposes tomake on the subject?

* The same charge has been levelled against the leader of the Opposition because he has ventured to draw attention to what he believes, to be a very serious defect in this Bill, and one which involves a radical departure from the accepted principles of **British** jurisprudence.

* What we are now asked to do is to adopt one of the worst features of Continental law which hitherto has been regarded as  Utterly  foreign to the accepted ideas underlying **British** justice, and wholly repugnant to **British** sense of fair  play.

* of the total importations of paraffine wax into the Commonwealth come from the Straits Settlements and from **British** Burmah.

* During recent years' the **British** Imperial Oil Company has .

* Healthy competition destroys monopoly, and the assistance of foreign and **British** trade is necessary to destroy andprevent the creation of monopolies, whether foreign or local.

* I think it would be very unfortunate if we allowed the liquor traffic to obtain in **British** New Guinea, practically without control, as is the case under the licensing systems in most of the States.

* In dealing with **British** New Guinea we are free from many of the difficulties which confront the making of the experiment in relation to Australia or similar places, and I think that something requires to be done in this direction.

* I understand that, although the white population totals only 500, there are some fourteen different establishments licensed to sell liquor in **British** New Guinea.

* For that reason I do not think it would be sufficient to allow ordinary licensed premises to exist in **British** New Guinea.

* The highest **British** tender was for 18 10s.

* The highest American tender was 145s., delivered free on board at New York in 48 weeks ; the lowest was 10 6s., delivered in any **British** port, and the time, 46 weeks.

* Lord George Hamilton said he hoped that **British** firms would expand their powers of production.

* Lord George Hamilton said that he hoped the **British** firms would expand their powers of pro- duction.

* A Hanover firm had tendered for the locomotives at a price 25 per cent, lower, and  a  delivery in half the time of the **British** tenders.

* But the difficulties of the problem are so tremendous at home that **British** statesmen stand absolutely appalled.

* They might go there in search of the minerals which we know are to be found in the **British** portion of the possession.

* The responsibility of administration is very great and is accentuated by distance and the Home Government, I feel sure, is perfectly seized of what might happen in the near future with regard to **British** New Guinea.

* When the honorable member was dealing with the latter part of his subject, I really could not help  thinking that the Bill  - which I, perhaps, had not carefully read in all its details - was one dealing with the separation of the Empire ; because his remarks would have been quite as applicable  to  a proposal that the union of sentiment and of affection, with a loose political texture, which has done so much for the **British** race throughout the world, was to be dissolved if this Bill were not accepted by the House.

* Is that the **British** policy  1  Does the **British** policy suggest that unless we provide for our local defence the operations of the Navy will not be permitted to conduce to the safety of Australia ?

* -I think that, on the whole, that is the only case where there was a final defeat of the **British** Navy.

* England was defeated in fifteen out of eighteen pitched naval battles with the American fleet, and authorities say that the reason was that the American fleet was founded on the principle of local defence, with armament far greater in proportion to the size of the vessels than that of the **British** ships, and as a consequence the **British** guns were completely outranged.

* The **British** Navy has not been engaged in any big naval warfare - unless we consider the American war of 1861 as such - since 1854, in which ironclads were really brought into action.

* He points out that the foreign blight is upon the **British** Navy, and that in 1900, 47 per cent.

* of the seamen on board **British** merchant vessels were foreigners.

* I know that the old spirit of the **British** is still there just as strongly as in the days when Campbell addressed his patriotic, apostrophe to " Ye mariners of .England."

* But surely when the proportion of **British** seamen drops, the efficiency must come down.

* Though I say that, I say it as one whose confidence is still unshaken in the comparative efficiency of the **British** seaman ; but we must note the tendency of the times and the changed conditions, and.

* I acknowledge - and I am not doing so now for the first time, because I did so in 1891 in a series of articles in one of the Australian papers - the great obligations of the **British** Possessions to the **British** Navy.

* I think that of the total export and import trade of England, about one-fourth or onefifth is with **British** Possessions, and in that we are interested jointly with England.

* According to the latest returns there is a trade with **British** Possessions amongst themselves, and with foreign countries, that never touches the shores of the United Kingdom, totalling 254,000, 000,and which equally with the other part of the foreign trade of the Empire secures the protection of the **British** fleet.

* per head, on the basis of the 106,000 contribution, to the defences of the Empire ; and the whole of the **British** possessions outside of the United Kingdom, inclusive of ourselves, contribute only 4d.

* Take the  Times,  which, as I have said, is to a large extent the echo of **British** Ministerial policy- 
I rise to again address myself to this important question, with not only a natural inclination, but a sense of public duty and a desire to comply with my election pledges.

* Then, at the last Conference of the Premiers of the scattered **British** possessions which assembled in London under the presidency of the Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain, the question of the adoption of a decimal system of- measures was brought forward, and it was resolved that it would be desirable for the representa.tive men composing the Conference to consult their States as to the best system to be adopted.

* These replies received from so many **British** possessions are distinctly in favour of the decimal system of weights and measures, and, although it was not a part of the inquiry, in many instances they express a very strong desire to see it accompanied by a reform in the direction of the decimalization of money.

* The decimalization of **British** money must come, and there is only one way in which it seems to me it can-be decimalized - that is by the method we are asking this Parliament to adopt for the Commonwealth.

* We therefore reported in favour of keeping as the gold standard and base of the Commonwealth coinage the existing **British** sovereign divided into ten florins.

* decimalizing **British** money is one which makes the least change, and creates the least friction.

* It is well known that it was owing to the desire to ultimately decimalize the sovereign, that the florin was introduced by the **British** Government, and a resolution was passed a little later in the **British** House of Commons requesting the Crown to immediately complete that decimal division, by adopting the very coins which this Committee recommended.

* The reform of the metric system will involve the loss of millions of pounds to the **British** public.

* It has been alleged by some of our **British** statesmen that Great Britain is failing to maintain her commercial supremacy.

* I believe that the late Treasurer has since had further communications on the subject with the **British** authorities, and I am rather anxious to learn the nature of them.

* Honorable members will, perhaps, recollect that, by a rule-of -three sum which I worked out by making a comparison with the **British** system, I calculated that the cost of minting 2,000,000 worth of silver coin would be 26,000.

* I appeal to the Committee for justice to an Australian industry, to assist it in overcoming the prejudice which exists against everything not bearing a **British** hall-mark.

* So long as the whole burden of maintaining the defence of this great Empire rests upon that congested and much poorer population in the **British** Isles, to which the right honorable the leader of the Opposition referred to-night, so long will the people of Great Britain, as well as their rulers, continue to regard us as being in a state of political tutelage and political dependence.

* per head- 
**British** fleet has to protect a vast commerce, which is mainly of benefit to Great Britain itself, especially the Indian commerce.

* But an Imperial Council, or any other body - call it by what name you will - even if it have representation from Australia, Canada, and the other selfgoverning **British** dependencies thereon, would never rise above the status or the rank or the responsibility of a Board of Advice unless, and until, the **British** Parliament was willing to concede to it some of the real governing power of the Empire.

* Here, sir, we are faced with one of those great problems - not we in Australia merely, but the people in Canada, and all the selfgoverning dependencies of the Empire - which have never yet been solved by any other community; and for this simple reason, that there never has been, so far as I am aware, an Empire like the present **British** Empire.

* If we look at the Roman Empire in ancient times, or if we look at the Spanish Empire in mediaeval times- 
The Spanish Empire had a great many millions of people, and in its geographical extent was as great as, perhaps greater than, the **British** Empire at the present time.

* I leave entirely out of sight all those unemancipated peoples who are **British** subjects and with whom we practically have little or nothing in common so far as political institutions are concerned.

* That is the only way in which to acquire recognition of our position as a selfgoverning and free **British** Dominion.

* My worst enemies have never spoken of me as a visionary, and, therefore, it will not be termed the dream of a visionary when I say that, in view of the probable increase of our population, I may live to see the time, and I hope that every honorable member will do so too, when Australia will be able to relieve the suffering millions of the **British** nation of the cost of policing the South-eastern Seas, and the Islands which are in them.

* As the great **British** Dominion in the Southern Seas, separated from the other parts of the Empire by great oceans, and, as the Prime Minister recently pointed out, by lands inhabited by nations differing from us.

* Nevertheless, it is said by the Prime Minister that, though the **British** ports are thrown open to the Colonies and **British** possessions, Australia desires greater advantages in the.

* **British** market.

* When nations like America and Germany are forcing their trade throughout the civilized world by means of subsidized steam-ship companies, it is necesary for us to consider whether it would not be wise for **British** communities to follow their example.

* The word " obsolete " has become in the **British** Navy, I will not say a slang expression, but a term which is entirely a relative one.

* A vessel may not be obsolete as regards vessels of the same class in other navies, but she may be obsolete according to the new standard which the **British** naval authorities have set up for themselves.

* The opinion of the Admiralty, however, as to what should be the policy of the **British** Navy as a whole, is an undivided opinion.

* It would influence them to this extent : That it is the policy of the **British** Navy to concentrate its forces at the point at which the trouble occurs, wherever that may be, and to come down upon and destroy the enemy.

* They would concentrate their forces to meet eventualities, in the same way that it is the traditional **British** policy te concentrate in order to force the hands of an enemy.

* It is perfectly true, therefore, that where the **British** trade is greatest, the probability of concentrated attack upon it, and the necessity for the concentration of the **British** naval forces is the greatest, also.

* We all hope that the  rapprochement  between the French and **British** nations may be followed by the most triumphant cordiality, because without disparagement to any other .

* nation - and valuing very much, as I do, the friendly connexions which at present exist between the **British** Empire and other countries - I still think that our nearest neighbour across the Channel is one with whom we should be always friendly.

* Despite occasional lapses, despite the knowledge that England has lost a colony on this occasion or upon that, and notwithstanding the memorable fact that she once left her fleet unmanned and unrigged in the Medway, so that the Dutch vessels sailed up and destroyed it, have we not the general result that, of all the empires of the world, the **British** has been the growing Empire, the civilizing Empire, that its reverses have been the most temporary, and its successes and extensions of power the most rapid and complete?

* The implication is unrestricted, and if vessels could be obtained to cover the long distances from points outside the sphere of action, and arrive in time to protect us in an emergency - and we may be sure a hostile fleet will always, as far as possible, be dogged by **British** vessels - then I take it that not even the restrictions in the agreement - not even the confinement of the sphere of operations to the Australian, China, and the East Indies stations - would deter the Empire, when it became necessary, from coming to our assistance.

* The primary duty of the squadron is, of course, the naval defence of Australia and New Zealand, and in this work it will be assisted, if necessary, by other ships of the **British** Navy.

* These men, according to Article 5 will be paid at special rates ; that is to say, they are not to be confined to the pay ordinarily given by the Admiralty to **British** sailors, but will be employed at a special rate, which will bring up their pay to a figure that can be reasonably accepted according to our notions of remuneration for services in Australia.

* The 470 to 500 men employed in the second-class cruiser will take service as active sailors in the **British** Navy under agreement for from three to five years, at the expiration of which they may have their discharge.

* I  am  only too painfully aware that a large number of **British** subjects have lately been introduced into the Commonwealth, possibly taking advantage of the length of time  elapsing  before the carriage of legislation on the subject.

* It has been a difficulty  to me all  along, because notwithstanding strict inquiry,  it  has been found  in all  these cases that the persons presenting themselves are **British** subjects, to whom,  as  I have often explained, no Act  of  State will apply.

* Until there  is  legislation upon the subject, the Commonwealth is helpless to prevent the introduction  of  **British** subjects.

* That sort of thing is not in accordance with the principles of **British** justice, and why it should be imported into this branch of the law I cannot understand.

* We desire to send our wheat, wool, wine, oil, and other products to Great Britain, and admit, on preferential terms mutually advantageous, commodities not manufactured, or likely to be manufactured, in Australia, but manufactured in England by **British** workmen.

* I am prepared to give the **British** people an absolute preference in the free admission of goods which are not manufactured here at present, and to reduce other duties.

* Any measure which, as it were, puts a legislative wedge between different sections of the community -who are trading under the principles of freedom, which every **British** community is supposed to concede to them, is, in my opinion, a socialistic measure.

* And yet at that time there were no less than thirteen shipping companies competing for the work provided by the producers of this country: 
**British**, and European financiers.

* The capital which sends Scotch manufactures to London and brings  back English corn  and manufactures to Edinburgh necessarily replaces by every such operation two **British** capitals, which had both been employed in agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain.

* The capital which sends **British** goods to Portugal and brings back Portuguese goods to Great Britain, replaces by every such operation only one **British** capital.

* It has been admitted on all hands that we now enjoy, not because of this contribution, the whole weight of the protection of the **British** Empire, and that practically the whole **British** Navy is at our disposal.

* Whatever the colonies are to do in aid of Imperial defence, must, in order to secure the best results, be absolutely spontaneous ; and later on, that the colonies - do not care to be protected by contract as it were, and instead of Subsidizing the **British** Navy they desire to have their own.

* In support of that argument, I wish to refer to a newspaper extract showing that during the ten years between 1891 and 1901 the number of lascars on **British** ships increased by 12,288, and the number of other foreigners by 8,730, while the number of **British** seamen decreased by 7,155.

* In 1S91 there were 37,794 **British** seamen rated as ablebodied, and in 1901 there were only 28,698.

* There is yearly a decreasing supply of trained men available for the **British** Navy.

* I will say then, that on this Council a gentleman from Australia less diffident than the Minister for Defence will be found advising statesmen who, guided by the traditions of ages, are directing the helm of **British** affairs.

* In dealing with this proposal, the leader of the Opposition referred us to the very apt illustration of the gentlemen in parti-coloured blankets, who represent Algiers in the French Parliament, and he invited us to say what effect we thought they had in the&gt; councils of that great nation, and to consider how much less influence would such a council, as is here proposed, have upon the policy of the **British** Empire ?

* In my opinion thatman will do best for the great **British**, Empire, and best for mankind, who will call a halt in a policy which involves an ever-increasing burden of that naval and military expenditure under which theBritish taxpayer is groaning, and which affords neither commensurate benefit nor added security in return.

* It is still increasing year by year, and the **British** Empire is asked tokeep up her naval force equal to any triplecombination.

* Ithas lately been the habit "of gentlemen here to point out that the man is an enemy of the **British** Empire who wishes to express, some such sound opinion as to its policy.

* Honorable members will remember that the Prime Minister seemed to have but one argument in support of his motion, and that was that the **British** Empire demanded the concentration of the naval force.

* The **British** forces were withdrawn from these shores is.

* In one place or another, the **British** have been either seeking fresh fields or defending possessions which they have already obtained.

* A local naval defence force may have deficiencies, but it is only in such a fleet that we can train the naval spirit which is inherent in the **British** race, and which now lacks development here for want of training, and when the day of peril comes, we must have a fleet in being.

* If the **British** fleet is withdrawn, what protection shall we have from raiding cruisers ?

* In that way, and in that way alone, has the **British** Empire been built up and defended.

* The agreement put forward is, no doubt, admirable, so far as the whole interests of the Empire are concerned, but it affords no assurance of safety for this particular part of the **British** dominions.

* There are massed in the China seas 69 Russian war vessels, whilst the **British** Navy is represented by a local squadron of four line-of-battle-ships besides other vessels ; and all the probabilities point clearly to **British** interests being most vulnerable at that point.

* We are told that in India the **British** Administration has removed war, but we have reason to believe that the Indian would prefer to live under his own system of Government - as it previously existed - and be permitted to engage now and then in a row, and, in short, to cut his neighbour's throat whenever he felt inclined to do so.

* Mr. Hunt  goes on to say - 
For twenty years we have been spending considerable sums of money in **British** New Guinea.

* That grant was subsequently increased to ^20,000, but notwithstanding these votes, and the expenditure locally of the revenue derived from **British** New Guinea, a considerable sum, there is not a good road to be found there - 
The fact that none of the banking companiesin Australia have thought it worth while to openbranches in **British** New Guinea goes to show that there is nothing to be made at it.

* I am not prepared to injure local industry by voting for the imposition of an ineffective duty on **British** imports.

* would be ineffective, as against **British** imports, why should I vote for a duty of  15  per cent.

* prepared to afford every man in Australia an opportunity to buy **British**-made engines, but if he desires to dp so, he ought to be prepared to pay a little more for them, or the **British** manufacturer should be ready to pay this duty and land his engines as cheaply as he can.

* - I believe that a Judge in any **British** community would refuse to sit.

* According to statements made by the merchants of this city, as well as of Sydney, no **British** candles are imported.

* Not **British** candles.

* But the new duty proposes an increase of 150 per cent, on the old rate, and 100 per cent, increase on goods of **British** manufacture.

* If it would be impossible to enforce these provisions against foreign vessels, then obviously their effect would be to penalize **British** ships to the advantage of foreign vessels.

* Surely the Government have no desire to subsidize foreign ships at the expense of **British** vessels.

* Of that number 29,000 are carried by **British** ships, and 7,000 by foreign vessels, or a total of 36,000 as against 179,000 ' carried in purely Australian steamers.

* I seriously doubt whether the form of agreement provided for in the proposed new schedule would not contravene the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act so far as **British**' vessels are concerned.

* What national complications may we not invite  by requiring an agreement of that kind from the master of a foreign, or even of a **British** ship?

* We are attempting to pass a law which will override the **British** Shipping Act and the shipping laws of foreign countries.

* Do we not all understand what constitutes the main attraction of the watering places of the **British** Isles?

* To further extend the service, so as to make periodical visits to the Gilbert and .Ellice Groups, which are **British**, but which have a considerable trade hitherto largely appropriated by German vessels from the Marshall Group.

* I believe our capacity to manufacture mining machinery is equal to that of most **British** peoples.

* Provision is made to insure that an Australian industry shall not, by unfair competition, injure or destroy another Australian industry ; but if an industry consists of importing and distributing goods from abroad, there is no reciprocity - there is no provision by which an Australian industry can be prevented from adopting unfair means to destroy that industry, which may not be Australian, but **British**.

* That is an illustration of how an Australian industry - if we may so call it - such as is proposed to be established, may be used to destroy, by what some people might consider unfair means1, a **British** industry - because industry extends not merely to the manufacturing, but to the trading in and distributing of goods.

* Them, if the clause is not to be fiscal, there should be some reciprocity, so that other industries, which are valuable to Australia and to the Empire - industries in which our fellow **British** citizens are engaged - shall not be destroyed by making it penal on the part of a **British** industry in these markets, while Australian industries are perfectly free to operate in the same objectionable manner, in regard to the **British** interest, without any restraint.

* remember that there is not only Australia to supply, but also the warships- which visit these shores, and **British** settlements which are nearer to Australia than to England.

* It is distressing to hear an honorable member stand up here and point out that the **British** sailor has practically disappeared, and at the same time object to legislation such as is now being proposed, which is the very thing that will cause him to return.

* It has been the introduction of cheap labour which has made it impossible for the **British** sailor to continue to follow the sea.

* When we compare the patriotism which has been dealt out to the **British** tar with the patriotism of other nations to their sailors, the tale tells against us.

* We desire to pass the amendment so that those vessels which we at least partly subsidize shall be manned by white **British** labour.

* The argument that **British** sailors cannot work in the stoke-holds when passing through the Red Sea falls to the ground in the face of the statement that they do the work better than other labour, not only in the Red Sea, but also right up the China coast.

* White men have had to take the place of Chinamen, who have been unable to fire **British** men-of-war, and it is idle to say that **British** sailors cannot fill these positions.

* The **British** sailor cannot, however, work under the same conditions as the blackfellow is asked to live and work under.

* Are we simply to pay the piper, and allow the conditions of the contracts to be determined by the **British** Government ?

* I have not the slightest fear that the **British** Government will veto the Bill.

* He now wishes to stipulate that the vessels carrying our mails shall be manned by white **British** subjects.

* I do not think that Parliament would pass such an enactment, because it would prevent other than **British** steamers from carrying our mails.

* Besides, we speak not as strangers, but as men bound to the peoples of the **British** Isles by the ties of allegiance and blood ; as to a large extent scions of the same stock, with traditions which are similar, and modes of thought not likely for many years to become widely divergent.

* On the other hand, we know that the strength of the **British** Empire, the very basis of its integrity, and the welding together into affection of its various parts, is due to the fact that it is based upon the principle of local autonomy.

* The people of the **British** Island's are not in all respects homogeneous - a fact which is evidenced by the application of certain Acts of Parliament to only portions of the Kingdom.

* The preamble recites that the Senate and House of Representatives have passed resolutions affirming that they are prepared to join in measures for the acceptance of **British** New Guinea as a Territory of the Commonwealth, and clause 5 declares that the possession of **British** New Guinea is hereby accepted .

* Subject  po  this Act, the laws in force in the possession of **British** New Guinea at the commencement o this Act shall continue in the Territory until other provision is made.

* - I have already addressed a communication to the **British** Government exactly on those lines.

* If that be done, **British** tradespeople will be afraid to take silver coined in this country.

* We could, at the end of each year, take up the Australian money circulating in England, and the **British** authorities could take up silver of **British** coinage circulating in this country.

* Is he aware of the fact that many of our fellow **British** subjects, and also our own Australian kinsmen, are starving in Cape Colony?

* I .know that the maintenance of the Empire depends upon the **British** Navy, and that Australia would be in a sorry plight without that navy, towards the cost of which we contribute, and ought to contribute.

* In the latest number of the  **British** Australasian,  Lord Tennyson expresses his opinion in the following words : - 
An alternative lias been suggested, and it is this - that instead of paying_ over to Great Britain the contribution of ^200,000 annually, it might be better if Australia spent the same sum in equipping and manning a fleet of torpedo boats and destroyers of her own which she would herself buy or build.

* Such a flotilla would be supplementary to, and act in close co-operation with the **British** Navy, and in case of war, might defend Australian harbours from raids, protect Australian sea-borne commerce, valued at ^145,000,000, keep touch with the enemy, and watch over the " danger areas " in the vicinity of Australian ports, and so liberate the Australian squadron more readily for service with the 
China squadron or elsewhere.

* After consultation with more than one naval expert, I cannot help thinking that this is a reasonable proposal, and well worthy of consideration and discussion, and, were it adopted, would have the additional advantage of satisfying in a measure the national and natural desire of Australia to be a sea power, and an effective bulwark of the **British** Empire in the Pacific.

* In a recent issue of the  **British** Australasian  is published an interview with Lieutenant Carlyon Bellairs, a member of the House of Commons, who makes some astounding statements.

* He states - 
The **British** squadron at present in Australian waters is quite inefficient, and in case of danger Australia is almost as defenceless as if there were no squadron at all.

* **British** Army, and I do not think that there can be any swindle in connexion with them.

* The Treasurer speaks of " our navy " after we clearly disregarded the very friendly warning from the **British** Government to arrange this business, as far as possible, by treaty.

* If they say, "We will back up the **British** Fleet in everything they do," I can understand that policy, but I do not understand the policy of condemning Great Britain for everything it does, and then turning round to whine and say, " We must look to it to safeguard us in whatever we do."

* There are millions of them, and if we do not place some restrictions on them, they will overrun the country, and, instead of being a **British** country, this will bo an Asiatic country.

* Ian] sure of this, and I have some reason to speak with confidence, that the **British** Government and the **British** people do not wish that to occur.

* At the conference of Premiers which took place in London in 1897, and which I attended as the representative of Western Australia, we were told by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the words that have been published, that the **British** Government were eager to do all that was possible to meet the aspirations of the Australian people.

* We have heard a good deal about the **British** race during this debate.

* I yield to no one in my pride in being able to say that I am a citizen of the **British** Empire.

* They want assistance and help, because the burden of management of the affairs of the great **British** Empire on which we are told the sun never sets must be a very heavy task indeed.

* The **British** Government desire to help us.

* It is not fitting that we should act towards the **British** Government like a lot of spoilt children.

* For the reason above stated, Your Commissioners have come to the conclusion that, for some time to come, Papua must depend for its defence on the **British** Fleet, helped (when constructed) by the Commonwealth destroyers.

* If offices belonging to foreign countries - I speak of offices other than Australian offices or **British** offices - receive business from the civil service, in the event of war between Great Britain and those countries we shall have our officers assured not merely in companies which are foreign, but in countries which are antagonistic.

* We ought not to exclude a **British** company.

* It would be a most undesirable thing to exclude **British** companies.

* In other words, the **British** manufacturers were given a preference of 1 per ton over American manufacturers.

* Thereupon the honorable member, in his capacity of Postmaster-General, wrote this minute - " As the writer says the difference in price between **British** and American wire is small, I think he may be informed that we intend to take the **British** article."

* It was pointed out that it was doing nothing to maintain **British** settlement in the New Hebrides ; that the French had subsidized the French New Hebrides Company to enter into trading enterprises there, to acquire land and to obtain settlement, and that it was seeking a preponderating influence which would settle the destiny of those islands.

* Those who had taken part in the opposition to the landing of the French marines were asked - " Will you do nothing to support **British** settlement against this competition on the part of the French Government."

* They were told that the company was not intended to make a profit ; that it was merely to retain **British** interests in the islands, and they knew that probably the money which they put into the company would be lost.

* In spite of that opposition, in spite of the immense sums which were spent by the French Government, they managed not only to maintain but to increase **British** trade with the islands, and also to increase to some small extent **British** settlement there.

* Yes ; I can say from my own knowledge that even with that subsidy a loss was suffered every year in the effort to maintain **British** influence in the ' group.

* Ships coming from Noumea through the reefopening could be blocked by one or two menofwar, and the offensive armaments which could be used against the **British** fleet in Sandwich harbour of the New Hebrides could not be used at New Caledonia.

* Naturally a commercial firm like Burns, Philp, and Co. look for some return from enlarging trade, but what has been desired all along is settlement by the **British** people, not, perhaps, in large numbers, but sufficiently large to promote **British** interests, and to resist the claim daily made in Paris that the French are predominant in landholding, settlement, and trade.

* I never had, and have not now, any pecuniary interest in these islands, except as one of the contributors to what was merely a donation towards the maintenance of the **British** connexion.

* The honorable member for Macquarie may urge that the **British**' taxpayer will have to bear the burden of the reduction of **British** postage to id.

* I do not believe that it will, because we are proposing to give the **British** manufacturers and producers a very great advantage over the traders of the Commonwealth by enabling them to send their  letters out  here for id., whilst we charge our own citizens 2d.

* I hope that full recognition will be given to the two duties to which reference has been made as being  imposed  on us by our acquisition of **British** New Guinea : tha one to our dark-skinned fellow-subjects - to give them the advantages of civilization, divesting them, so far as we are able, from the evils that too often follow in their train ; the second to ourselves - to make the fullest use of the goodly heritage it is our privilege to possess.

* My argument is that we should change our policy, and maintain the prestige of the **British** race, which has been the great colonizer of the world in modern times.

* The **British** Empire exists on the principle of a family, and not on those of a syndicate.

* That statement shows  Mr. Lloyd  George to be a determined opponent of **British** preference, and, so far as one can judge, he will be so in the future; at any rate, until we can supply Great Britain with all the raw products which she requires, and which she has now to get largely from other countries.

* In a number of cases the **British** manufacturer gets a preference over the non-  **British** producer, paying 40 per cent, instead of 45 per cent., 25 per cent, instead of 30 per cent., 15 per cent, instead of 20 per cent., but in the majority of important cases- this benefit is accompanied by a considerable enlargement of the duties formerly levied on his goods, and  the price he pays for' his advantage over the foreigner is an increase in his disability as against the native Australian.

* "I shall not read further from the  **British** Weekly',  but I have here another quotation which shows the opinions of people at Home, in opposition to the statements read by Ministers last night.

* us and formerly imported into Australia have been put upon the free list; in not a single other case has a **British** product had the duty imposed upon it reduced ; and so far as our inquiry has gone this duty has been increased along the entire schedule of **British** goods entering Australian ports.

* To be sure, the Reuter dispatch informs us that there is a preference of between 5 and 10 per cent, accorded to **British** manufactures ; whether any conditions are laid down under'  which this preference is to be enjoyed we do not at present know.

* The innocent representative of Reuter informs us, no doubt on the authority' of the author of the Budget, that the preference given to **British**" products entering Australia will amount to something like 1,500,000 a year.

* While we may have opinions regarding the fiscal policy of any country or any Colony, we certainly have no right or disposition to complain or protest against the duties imposed against imports, **British** or foreign, by the Australian Commonwealth.

* Such is Birmingham's experience under the new Australian tariff, and the losses, misfortunes, and 'possible disasters will not be " made good " by  Mr. Deakin's  proclamation issued through  The Times  correspondent at Sydney to " **British** merchants and supporters of 
Preference."

* But here 'is the proclamation sent from Sydney to soothe and comfort the **British** exporter.

* But the manufacturers of bicycles and other wares in Birmingham do not understand how a tariff can be made " much more favourable " for **British** wares by being raised in practically all cases, and in some to such an extent as to exceed the first cost of the article.

* If it be possible for a minority to rule a majority we shall have to reverse everything, and frame a new Constitution that will be the antithesis of the **British** Constitution, and we shall have to re-write, in reverse order, every maxim that has hitherto been acknowledged.

* Taking first the Western Australian railway, I find that **British** policy", so far as it has been directed at all during the last few years has been more and more directed into converting the Indian Ocean into a **British** lake.

* If honorable members will look at the map of the countries that surround the Indian Ocean, starting from Cape Town, and going then to **British** East Africa along to Egypt, then along the southern shores of Asia right away round to the Malay peninsula, and down to Australia, they will see that the whole of the lands contiguous to the Indian Ocean are becoming more and more painted red, and this shows that when we ' are considering our defence problem we shall be able far more economically to meet the position if we view that side of .our responsibility as really an extension of **British** policy in the Southern hemisphere, leaving outside the Pacific problem, which will have to be dealt with independently.

* The **British** textile workers insist upon the employment of union men only ; but, in this and in other trades, the exclusion has become so complete that it has almost ceased to be felt.

* A union card is a matter of course, and a matter of absolute necessity to a man desiring to engage in many **British** trades, and membership in a union is considered a privilege and not a burden.

* As I said on the second reading, there is a greater violation done in this Bill to the individual liberties and rights of citizens of a civilized country than I know of in any other legislation in the **British** Empire.

* The **British** Government never borrow for the army and navy, except in times of great stress when a war is on; and that is the case in America.

* Many of them do not know to-day what it means That is the reason why so many members of the Government, and those who are in sympathy with them in the States, are trying to form organizations and to hold meetings for the purpose of explaining to the people the very things which  Mr. Chamberlain  has told the **British** people the Colonies have demanded.

* Under the circumstances, either  Mr. Chamberlain  has been misled by somebody as to the demands of the Australian people, or he himself is woefully misleading the **British** people by making these' statements.

* But suppose that 528,000,000 worth of imports come into Great Britain, and that the **British** people were- so reduced by some calamity or other that they were not able to give anything in return.

* When we come  to examine more closely into the Board of Trade figures we find that the value of the earnings of **British** shipping in the carrying trade is ^90.000,000, and that the interest accruing from loans to other countries is also ^90,000,000, or a total of ^180,000,000, which makes exactly a balance.

* Seeing that  Mr. Chamberlain  himself, up to within the last nine months or so, was so persistent in pointing out the increasing prosperity and increasing prestige of the **British** nations- amongst the nations of the world, we must look for a motive in this sudden change of opinion on his part.

* Chamberlain is deceiving the 
**British** people and the Australian people to-day, or he has been deceiving the **British** and Australian people for the.

* If Great Britain has not been crumbling to pieces all these years, then  Mr. Chamberlain  is deliberately deceiving the' **British** and Australian people.

* We have given Great Britain practical proof of our loyalty, and are prepared to do so at the present time, by- tearing 'down the tariff wall which keeps **British** goods out of Australian markets.

* The sinister motive behind is embodied in the cablegram which was .received on 9th October last year, in which it is stated - 

 Mr. Chamberlain was then appealing to the **British** workers, and he proceeded - 
In that lies the germ of truth in the whole scheme behind the proposal.

* The proposals mean taking us into Imperial schemes of which we may not ultimately approve ; they mean giving the **British** nation the right to tax Australians for **British** purposes, and they mean additional burdens on the **British** taxpayers.

* As to the alleged decline of **British** industries, Ave learn from one of the eminent statisticians who writes in the  Quarterly Review  that - 
And we know that business had to be turned away.

* Only recently Canada required some locomotives built,, and desired to place the order with **British** firms, but those firms had to refuse the work because their workshops contained as much work as they could undertake.

* Facts like these are the most conclusive answer to the demands of  Mr. Chamberlain  and the insatiable Tories behind him, who, under the specious pretence of "binding the Empire" together, seek to drag self-governing colonies into the meshes' of an Imperial taxation scheme which will pile up intolerable burdens on the backs of the labouring masses of the **British** Empire.

* Mr. Chamberlain,  speaking in 1881, said - 
More than twenty years ago those in the ranks of the protectionists were talking about the decline of **British** trade, and the decay of the nation.

* Those figures show most conclusively the immense strides which have been made by **British** commerce during the period of freedom, as contrasted with its expansion during the period in which the restrictive policy of protection prevailed.

* Comparing the general condition of the working classes in the two periods, it is notorious that for many years before the repeal of the 'Corn Laws, and right up to the time of their repeal, the condition of the **British** worker was most unenviable.

* We are told that preferential trade will confer a benefit upon the **British** workman.

* Instead of extending the hand of brotherhood, they postponed the consideration of the appeal, and the representatives of **British** labour in the House of Commons are still waiting for an answer.

* I do not want to see anything done that would tend to the disruption of the **British** Empire, and that is one of the reasons why I should strongly- oppose any proposal of the character indicated by  Mr. Chamberlain.

* If he appears here in the character of a distinguished **British** statesman, he will have a right to expect the same honour and hospitality that would be shown towards an equally eminent visitor from any country.

* action in that direction would be resented, But I am also certain that no australian would attempt to obtrude himself upon the field of **British** politics.

* The sixth paragraph of the Governor- General's Speech reads as follows : -  
I would like to make a few remarks on the impressions I have formed of Australia as a field for settlement for **British** men of capital and experience in agriculture.

* This must seriously tend to alarm both **British** and other investors, and to depreciate Australian stocks in the money markets of the world.

* He instituted a comparison between the Australian soldier and the **British** soldier, not only as regards fighting qualities, but also as regards ordinary intelligence.

* I feel sure that there is not a single Australian soldier who has fought side by side with the **British** troops in South Africa but would laugh at such a comparison as the honorable member attempted.

* But it must be remembered that the conditions of warfare in South Africa were particularly those in which the Australian soldier was likely to be most effective, and they were at the same time likely to act against the experience of the **British** soldier.

* We see that over 80 per cent, of the vessels of the **British** Navy are gathered around the **British** coasts in order to watch for and ward off any attack upon the heart of the Empire.

* In that I agree; and there are so many foreign ships close  to the heart of the Empire, that very few of the **British** Fleet are available for service abroad.

* I would be the last in the world to belittle the **British** Navy.

* In my opinion our own oversea defence must always be undertaken by the **British** Navy; and all that we can expect to do is to assist that navy by such means as I have indicated, and, perhaps, by providing a small fleet of torpedo destroyers, and submarines, and so forth, in the way suggested by the Government.

* Another motive would be the feeling that the Commonwealth should have the power to decide whether or not the navy should be used in any part of the world, the idea no doubt being that there might be a panic in the Old Country, and that the Australian Navy might be taken off to the **British** Channel, or elsewhere, leaving the Australian coast unprotected.

* That being so, there is removed any possible motive for the creation of a sea-going navy ; and I feel sure that honorable members agree that the **British** Fleet ought to be helped in every way possible.

* Far more than 200,000 is spent annually in our towns by the vessels of the **British** Navy, and there is also the indirect advantage that we have some 500 Australians trained in the finest naval school in the world.

* I candidly admit that if we had the power, and if the **British** Government give us the power - 
I would go to any extreme of prohibition to prevent a large number of these coloured people from settling in the waste lands of the tropical parts of Australia.

* An Australian will not allow a Japanese to come into his own country, but he goes into Japan, and calls himself a **British** subject, and any man who attempts to shut him out, he threatens with the **British** flag.

* These things being so, it is preposterous, in this age of intelligence, to talk of Ireland wishing to separate from the **British** Empire.

* I shall vote for the motion, because I believe that if Home Rule be granted to Ireland, it will tend to perpetuate the **British** Empire.

* Her downfall was brought about by the same human frailty that is now threatening to wreck the **British** Empire - her failure to do justice to some of the people under her sway.

* Those managers might just as reasonably he expected to represent the Commonwealth as **British** or foreign capitalists.

* They considered that, by giving all these facilities .to the **British** Navy, we should bear our share of the cost of protecting the trade of Australia.

* In the course of the same year the **British** Government forwarded a despatch to the Premiers, in which they showed that they thoroughly appreciated the stand taken up by South Australia.

* The despatch clearly set forth the opinions held by the **British**  Government  as bo what our duties were, and I think those opinions still prevail in high  quarters  in England.

* It will give an opportunity to youths who wish to follow the sea to obtain a proper training in **British** naval methods, and if eventually Australia establishes a navy of her own, it will no doubt be their proud aspiration to join it.

* I hope" that- upon the termination of the present agreement we shall have an Auxiliary Squadron which we shall pay for ourselves as part of the **British** Imperial fleet in the Pacific.

* He told the House that the first proposal of the Lords of the Admiralty was that 
Australia should pay a contribution of 467,000 per annum, the **British** Government to pay a similar amount.

* Our trade with Great Britain amounts to 66,000,000 ; that with **British** colonies and possessions is valued at 15,000,000; and that with foreign ports at 28,000,000.

* We might well enter into the proposed arrangement with the **British** Government, because, unless we desire to cut the painter, it would be in every respect as effective as that suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports.

* I do not think that the **British** Government inserted this article simply as an inducement to Australians to enter into the new arrangement; but it indicates to us that they are alive to the importance of Australia, and the means which it affords for obtaining supplies for their ships.

* The policy of the **British** Navy had been always to seek the enemy, to take the offensive and not the defensive.

* - Is the honorable member not supposing that the **British** Navy is  non est?

* I am of opinion that we should long remain an integral part of the **British** Empire, that we should either stand or fall with the **British** people, and that we should contribute something in proportion to the degree of protection that our trade receives from the policy of the Admiralty.

* As a **British** Admiral said, 200 years ago, "It is better tobe alarmed now, as lam, than next summer, when the French fleet may be in the Channel."

* **British** communities are not, as a rule, greatly concerned with the question of how an election may affect the country.

* of Commons for Battersea), has cabled as follows to  Mr. J.  C. Watson, ex-Prime Minister of Australia, and leader of the Australian Labour Party :  - " I adhere to the facts and the appeal set forth in the manifesto issued by the **British** labour representatives in the House of Commons in August, 1903, to the labour representatives in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

* Mr. Chamberlain's  proposals for preferential Tariffs,' whatever their application to Australian products, would undoubtedly mean a rise in the price of foodstuffs for **British** workers."

* I feel sure that the Australian Labour Party does not desire to adopt anything which, while it might offer some little advantage tothem, would entail tremendous sacrifices upon **British** workers and their families.

* I appeal to Australian workers to respect the feelings of their **British** comrades, so emphatically expressed at the Congress, where representatives of all sections of **British** labour unanimously, declared against any system of preference.

* If I understand the amendment correctly, its effect will be to deny a preference to **British** goods, which are carried in **British** ships that may employ a German, French, or an Italian seaman.

* If he is not prepared to do that, he should not endeavour to exclude them from employment upon **British** ships.

* I find, however, that in regard to the bulk of the goods which we import wholly from Great Britain, no preference is given, and that the difference of  2j  and  s  per cent, between the **British** and foreign rates in many cases is merely a nominal preference.

* Undoubtedly ; but it is ridiculous to talk of duties of  45  per cent, against the foreigner, and  40  per cent, against **British** goods, when the particular goods are supplied by Great Britain, as giving a preference to **British** manufacturers.

* Such duties give no advantage to **British** manufacturers, and unduly tax our consumers and primary producers, who are the backbone of the country.

* I have had experience of various classes of machinery ; and I have always endeavoured to obtain the local article in preference to the imported article, or the **British** article in preference to the foreign article.

* Whilst I do not wish to be hysterical over this matter, I realize that the loyalty which will be displayed at the Coronation ceremonies is loyalty to the **British** Empire.

* If the **British** people have a characteristic, it is that of being deliberative and phlegmatic, and not allowing themselves to be carried to extremes.

* 1 do not look on this celebration as a mere compliment to the King, but as another proof to the powers of the world that we can, after the time of trouble is over, provide a representation, symbolical of the solidity of the **British** Empire.

* We both spring from **British** loins.

* _ At the time of the war nearly all those in the United States were of **British** descent.

* It may be, but would the **British** investor regard it as a good asset ?

* Until lately, at all events, the **British** Government have been able to make use of a patent without paying any compensation.

* 1 from **British** Guiana, 1 from Bulgaria, and 7 whose birth-places are unknown.

* The **British** House of Commons, which is called the '' mother of Parliaments," has given us an example in this regard.

* As to the future of Party Government, if it is not killed by an enactment which the present Government can cover themselves with glory by "introducing, I am convinced that these words, spoken by the elder Pitt when the **British** House of Commons was in a somewhat similar position to that with which we are faced to-day, are very  apropos - 
An infant, not being a natural-bom **British** subject, whose father or whose mother (being a widow or divorced) has obtained a certificate of naturalization, and who has at any time resided in Australia with such father or mother, shall, in the Commonwealth, during infancy, be naturalized.

* The result appears to be that there are now two ways in which women may be naturalized, namely, by application under clause 5, or by marrying a **British** subject.

* Further, the amendment in clause 5 allows **British** women who marry nonnaturalized aliens to retain their nationality.

* We know that as soon as hostilities were declared the .Boers invaded the **British** territory, and it appeared to me to become at that time a question of the maintenance of **British** supremacy in South Africa, and whether the **British** or the Boers should rule in South Africa.

* If there is one conviction thoroughly imprinted upon Australians, whether they reside where they are surrounded by the luxuries obtainable in centres of population, or are fighting the forces of nature in the desert, that conviction is that under no flag on earth could they get the same liberty or freedom as they get under the **British** flag.

* I read that statement when it appeared in the press in Australia, and the  interpretation I put upon it was, that the wishes of the **British** colonies in South Africa would be given full consideration to in the final settlement of the war.

* When we were considering the question of Australia's contribution towards the maintenance of the **British** Navy, no member of this House desired to go further than I did.

* But I fail to see why, year after year, we should continue to make a present of that amount to the people of Great Britain, and then quibble about voting an extra  1,000  or two towards the maintenance of the **British** Navy.

* The argument has been advanced that, by introducing the reform we shall dislocate our relations with the **British** Empire.

* The only reason why we keep in touch with the **British** sovereign and the 2s.

* Prom time to time during this debate our attention has been drawn to the **British** worker, whose condition has been cited as one to which the workers of other countries might well aspire.

* It has been urged that fiscal freedom has practically emancipated the **British** workmen, and that they can win their strikes, when, according to to the leader of the Opposition, the workmen in protected countries never win a strike.

* In this connexion I wish to quote* not an American, but a representative of the **British** artisan, who made a thorough research into American conditions.

* I refer to  Mr. H.  J. Pettifer, the secretary of the Workmen's Association for the Defence of **British** Industry.

* The extract, which I wish to read, is as follows : - 
Last night the executive committee of the Workmen's Association for the Defence of **British** Industry held their first meeting since the return of their secretary from the United States.

* After this secretary of **British** workmen had made this tour, and addressed 30 large meetings throughout the States- 
The Secretary of the Workmen's Association for the Defence of **British** Industry.

* Just received cable from Agent-General thataction taken to prevent landing of **British** workmen seriously affects financial proposals of this: State.

* As I have mentioned before, I spent fifteen months at Shoeburyness, twenty-two or twenty-three years ago, in going through a course "of gunnery instruction, and', although, my education cost the **British** Government something like 1:60, I found, on visiting the forts at Queenscliff recently, that I knew as little about the manning of the guns' there as the rawest recruit.

* The honorable member for Wentworth pointed out to-night that the artillery arm is the scientific branch of the service, and I suggest that, in exchanging officers with other parts of the **British** Dominions, we should insist upon getting artillery and engineer officers.

* The Australian cavalryman is second to none in the **British** Dominions.

* The **British** Government would not so act to the worst men or the lowest-paid men in the service.

* I cannot, however, agree with the honorable member, in one of the deductions which he sought to draw, in common with  Mr. Scott,  however valuable his report may be - that an extension of **British** trade with South Africa has resulted from the preference granted in the  ad valorem  rates to **British** goods.

* Some of the provincial Legislatures have carried resolutions in favour of  Mr. Chamberlain's  policy, but when amendments were proposed to be added to those resolutions showing that the method of expressing sympathy with  Mr. Chamberlain's  proposals should be by lowering the duty on **British** imports without increasing the duties against the foreigner, and when these amendments were in favour of the reduction of duties thev were ignominiously rejected.

* **British** India sent to Great Britain nearly 6,000,000 quarters ; and we go right down the scale until we come to Australia, 2,400,000 quarters, and Canada, 1,450,000 quarters.

* At all events, one of the suggestions was that the cable ought to  be made purely **British**, and there were one or two smaller recommendations connected with military defences, into which I need not enter.

* As has been pointed out in the correspondence with the Commonwealth Government, these are privileges which the company enjoy in almost all **British** possessions to a greater or lesser extent.

* That is a right which, according to the memorandum of the company, is enjoyed in Great Britain and in almost all **British** possessions.

* It is also given in France under the arrangement between Great Britain and that country, because there is a special line to Marseilles along which messages are sent with the consent of the **British** and French Governments.

* I might point out that legislation upon the lines of this Act has been adopted in almost every portion of the **British** Empire, including all the Australian States except Queensland.

* Its object is to prevent a person from using the name of a manufactory or producing place within the Commonwealth, or within the **British** Empire, with the object of misleading.

* It classes as prohibited goods all goods to which a false trade description has been applied, and goods bearing the name of a place situated in Australia without qualification, or foreign-made goods with a **British** name upon them, without similar qualification.

* The next clause applies in the same way to places in the **British** Dominions.

* Mr. Chamberlain  sent out a treatise upon the guiding principles of the **British** Empire from time immemorial, and laid down the strong objections to any legislation based on distinction of race and colour, and the Federal Ministry said - "Yes,  Mr. Chamberlain  ! "

* Mr. Chamberlain  went on to say that, besides the basic principles, on which the **British** Empire has been constructed, such legislation would be peculiarly offensive to Japan - "Yes,  Mr. Chamberlain  ! "

* It is what is known as free-trade in England, and we take our cue from the **British** people.

* The criticisms of gentlemen who have accepted the theory that in trade nothing but cheapness is to be valued, and who decline to give the slightest consideration to questions of Empire and kinship, are not likely to induce Australians to come, to a wrong conclusion as to the value of the action which is evidently now contemplated by the **British** Government.

* Consideration of the present position isbeing forced upon Britain by the action of" Canada, and I venture to think that **British** statesmen will rise to the occasion.

* Under such circumstances, **British** sentiment in relation to her colonies.

* The **British** Government intend to appeal to the country, and I venture to think that our duty is to wait, and to wish, and to hope, and to hold ourselves in readiness to support the mother country in every possible way.

* Therefore, let us hope that such conditions of instability as do exist may be replaced at an early date by a better state of affairs, in which the national sentiment shall find practical expression by assent to proposals which it is evident the **British** Government propose to make at the earliest possible opportunity.

* -Really, after the statements which have been made by the two gentlemen who are at the head of the= **British** Cabinet, it would appear that the honorable member has spoken without reflection.

* The **British** Government have acted in view of the elections, and have unfolded a programme of which their announcement relating topreferential trade will form a leading feature.

* Knowing what we do of the astuteness and statesmanship of the Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain, it may be taken for granted that he feels that the Government programme is one which will appeal to the great heart of the **British** people.

* In connexion with this aspect of the matter, reference has been made to the fact that of the men required to man the vessels of the **British** mercantile marine, only  47  per cent, are Britishers, all the rest being foreigners, who could not be relied upon in time of war.

* Of course, we all desire that the **British** marine should be manned entirely bv people of our own race, and I presume that the United States authorities thought that by means of the legislation which they passed they would insure a similar result with regard to .their own ships.

* The Arbitration Bill would be " hung up " awaiting the Royal Assent, assuming the Government are successful in passing these clauses ; and, of course, the Navigation Bill, which affects **British** shipping, will also have to be reserved.

* And now, if you will only add to that our present exports to the **British** Possessions of 96 millions, you will find that that gives employment, at 30s.

* Mr. Chamberlain  points out that, as the result of this policy, a greater number of persons would be supported by the growth of **British** manufactures, while an increased population in Australia would be supported by the consequential expansion of our own manufactures and productivity.

* The Prime Minister last night quoted certain figures regarding the growth of imports in the **British** Empire, but I think that the following statement by  Mr. Chamberlain  gives us the true position.

* I donot think that any one would accuse him of saying or doing anything, that would be detrimental to the welfare of the **British** Empire, or would suggest that he would knowingly tell an untruth regarding thedecline of **British** trade.

* I propose to put a low duty on foreign corn, no duty at all on the, corn coming from our **British** possessions.

* What we suggested in regard to New Zealand was that she should  give a general preference of 10 per cent, an all round' reduction of the present duties on **British** manufactured goods, or an equivalent in respect to lists of selected articles on the lines proposed by Canada, either by further reducing her duties in favour of the United Kingdom - and- New Zealand can do that, because she has higher duties than the Commonwealth - or by raising the duties against foreign imports, which is what we want to do, and by imposing duties on certain foreign imports now on the free list.

* At the Colonial Conference held in London on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Jubilee,  Sir Samuel  Griffith, then" Premier of Queensland, proposed for discussion - 
Whether -it should not be recognised as  part  of the duty of the governing bodies of the Empire to see that their own subjects have a preference over foreign subjects in matters of trade ; and that if any member of the Empire thinks fit, for any reason, to impose Customs charges upon goods imported from abroad, it should be recognised that goods coming from **British** Possessions should be subject to a lighter duty than those coming from foreign possessions.

* A man's first dufy is to his family, and then to his country ; and by country I mean it in the larger sense - the whole .**British** Empire.

* The right honorable gentleman for- got, however, that the steps now proposed are to improve the position of the **British** people.

* Then the **British** Squadron, under this treble-headed command, would sail over the seas to do nothing, or worse than, nothing.

* Let us show the world that we are quite content to place confidence in the **British** Government and the **British** Admiralty.

* I cannot conceive how we could debate with the **British** Admiral the instructions which he has received from the Admiralty.

* **British** Indians may be more affected than others, because, as **British** subjects, they need not be naturalized.

* Naturalization is one of the qualifications under the Old-age Pensions Act, and, therefore, the provision in section 16 of the Old-age Pensions Act hits more directly, it seems to me, at our Indian fellow subjects than others, because, although they are **British** subjects, they cannot obtain a pension under that section of the Act.

* We have the protection, not only of the Australian Squadron, but of the **British** Fleet on the China station, and it is from that quarter that it is said we may expect trouble.

* I have no doubt that some system by which we could protect our coasts and assist the **British** Navy in time of trouble would be acceptable and proper ; but how many ships can we build ?

* The outstanding feature of that Conference was the loyalty evidenced by General Botha to the **British** flag, and even if the gathering had no other result, the great sentiment of loyalty which permeated it would fully justify it.

* In other words, the mails are carried throughout upon **British** ships, or through **British** territory.

* Mails would be carried throughout by **British** ships, and over **British** territory.

* The company has employed **British** men on **British** ships, and has made a brave fight against a competitor which has been so unscrupulous that the  President  of the Board of Trade has said that the time may come when it will have to  be prosecuted criminally for its wicked and cruel treatment of the lascars in its employ.

* The Orient Steam Navigation Company has never had the finger of scorn pointed at it for carrying German goods imported to England, and transhipped at London for Australia, for 100 per cent, less than the rates at which it carried **British** goods from London to Australia.

* Would it not be remarkable if in this century of advance in the application of science, and the introduction of machinery, a go-a-head virile, energetic nation like the **British** had failed to succeed and make progress and bring about changes?

* In theUnited States, where private enterprise is allowed a freedom unknown in any **British** community, great combines and trusts have been built up.

* That the following words be added to the schedule - " Pig, rolled, and plate iron under the following designations :  - Blooms, bullets, slabs, angles, tees, rounds, flats, squares, and all other sections of rolled iron and steel, sheet or plate, black or galvanized, up to 5-16th inch thickness,  ad valorem  (**British**), 12 per cent.

* Pig iron,  ad valorem  (**British**), 10 per cent.

* That is the opinion of an old and experienced member of the **British** House of Commons, who went on to say - 
That is a very strong indictment, considering its source, and  Mr. Asquith's  remarks are very opportune at the present time, when the **British** Parliament is likely to be asked to discard the barbarous methods which he denounces in such forcible terms, and1 which have been found so injurious to the public interests.

* As I think it inadvisable that the consideration of the proposal for the adoption of the new implements of torture which the Government " desire to acquire shall be proceeded with until the whole of the Standing Orders can be discussed, I wish to give notice of the following amendment - which I shall not move at the present stage, so that "the discussion of the original question may not be hindered - 
That this House authorizes the Government to accept **British** New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth, if His Majesty's Government are willing to place it under federal control.

* I am willing to vote for that proposal if it be amended slightly so as to read that "towards the expenses of **British** New Guinea this House is willing," &amp;c, to vote the money.

* The peculiar danger of our acquiring possession of the **British** possession in New Guinea is that it is not an island in itself bordered by the sea, but for many hundreds of miles, I do not know know the distance, but probably it is not far short of 1,000 miles along an unknown boundary line, we shall be fronted on one side by the territory of Germany, and on the other side by the territory of Holland.

* We know that in the old days Great Britain was proud to possess the West Indies, but we know now that they have became an absolute drag upon the Imperial Exchequer, and that Jamaica had to be financed last year by the **British** Government.

* I have been long enough connected with politics in this country to remember a debate in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on the everlasting quarrel which crops up between the French and the **British** in the New 
If there were no other great powers anxious to acquire the islands than ourselves it would be straight sailing ; but are we to ignore the great military and naval powers of Europe, to say that we have a vested right in the waste lands of the earth to the exclusion of all other peoples?

* There could be nothing more detrimental to the interests of the islands, to the Commonwealth, and to the **British** people themselves than to have dual control, to have the French and English managing the New Hebridies, and the Germans and the English Samoa, when the islands should be in the hands of one power or the other.

* I prefer, if we are to have these islands in the South Seas, that they should become protectorates under the Imperial authority, when we should have the **British** navy to keep order, or if they rose to a higher level than that, they might become colonies, but I am not prepared to make any of them part of the Commonwealth.

* In what position does **British** New Guinea stand?

* It is annexed by the **British**.

* I think that the refusal means that the **British** Government do not want to find all the money, and if we are prepared to find it, I have no doubt that they will find gentlemen to administer the island and keep order.

* In view of the circumstances that Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria entered into obligations to find the money to help to administer the affairs of **British** New Guinea, I am perfectly willing for the Commonwealth to find the money.

* Some one objected just now to the term " **British** justice," but if it is Australian justice that the Department has meted out in this case, I say, save me from it.

* We desire that **British** justice shall be done.

* Then in reference to the **British** Cotton Association, which is a large buyer, the report states - 
The **British** Cotton Growing Association, Manchester, stated in 1904 that they were willing, to purchase all seed cotton of any quality for 1d.

* As has been remarked before this evening, it matters very little to the Australian worker whether his employment is destroyed by the German or the **British** manufacturer.

* The  White Slaves aif England  discloses a sad condition of things prevailing in **British** industries, some of which will be affected by this proposal.

* The people of the **British** race, no matter where they may settle, will not be kept in leading-strings.

* It was then seen that people of **British** descent will not submit to undue interference.

* Weare being asked to benefitpersons wholive (like leeches upon the **British** people, by adopting proposals which will enable them to make their fortunes still larger.

* The Minister proposesto move an amendment which will improve the proposal, by providing that preference shall be given only in respect to **British** goods carried in **British** ships, and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie wishes to go further, and to stipulate that these ships shall be manned by white labour.

* I am with the honorable member in that; but I think that there will be the risk of playing into the hands of the **British** shipping ring, from whose exactions we have already suffered, if we put an end to the competition of foreign shipping firms.

* German, and American lines now compete with **British** lines for the transport of our butter and other products, and this competition keeps freights down to something like a reasonable figure.

* If we give a practical monopoly in certain lines to **British** manufacturers and **British** shipowners, our primary producers may suffer more than they do at the present time.

* Is it not correct, as recently stated by  Mr. Henniker-Heaton,  that the Imperial Government and the Governments of the **British** Possessions together spend annually in.

* Is it not true that the **British** people pay 1,000 a day for cables to Australia, 1,000 a day for cables to India, 1,000 a day for cables to South Africa, 1,000 a day for cables to China and the East, and 1,000,000 a year for cables to the United States?

* There is, therefore, no serious reason for excluding **British** goods under the provisions of Part III.

* Not only has Great Britain given us this Continent as a heritage, but, with surprising generosity, she has allowed us full rights of self-government If she had considered her self-interest alone, it would have instigated her to withhold from us the power to , tax her goods, and to frame our Constitution so as to provide for the free entry of **British** goods into Australia.

* The people of Great Britain, who are comparatively poorer than those of Australia, have to dip deeper into their pockets, and pay more per head for defence, than we do, so that our shores and our commerce may be protected by the **British** Fleet.

* The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has had every opportunity to impose conditions regarding the terms, as to payment of duty, under which **British** goods will be admitted here, and has exercised it, to the full.

* Great Britain does not interfere with these importations; but if the tenets of some men were to become those of the **British** people as a whole, there would be retaliation.

* For the purpose of this Act, implements of **British** manufacture shall be deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand, ' and the importers of such implements shall be deemed to be manufacturers thereof in New Zealand.

* It will be observed that not only does the New Zealand Act provide that implements of **British** manufacture shall be " deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand," but it makes the further provision that the importer of such implements shall be deemed to be a manufacturer in New Zealand.

* That means that if a bonus is given to prevent the destruction of industries by foreign importations, the importer of a **British** implement gets that bonus as well as does the New Zealand manufacturer.

* Whatever we may think of the New Zealand legislation, and of its nature and necessity, surely we must recognise, as New Zealand has done, the generosity of Great Britain, the support we get from the **British** Empire, and the protection it gives to us.

* In a Bill such as this, where no need can be shown as regards **British** goods for such provisions as those which we are considering, we ought to recognise our debt to the mother country.

* Is the Government prepared to say deliberately in this measure that **British** goods shall be prevented from coming -here under the very same conditions as those under which we send goods to Great Britain ?

* Is he prepared to say that the policy of preference - of concession for concession - which this Government has supported, is so much empty sham, and that we shall take the first opportunity we get, not to assist Great Britain to send goods here, but to shut out **British** goods from our markets when there is no need for it ?

* It has not been shown that there has been any dumping of **British** goods into Australia, except that dumping which consists in the export of a surplus, and the obtaining of the best possible price in the market to which the goods are exported; which is the class of dumping that we carry on with the great bulk of our exported products.

* That gentleman saw no good reason to exclude **British** implements.

* He saw no reason why, if a bonus were given, it should not  be  granted to the importers of **British** implements as well' as to the manufacturers of :them in New Zealand.

* I do not believe that any clanger of dumping from Great Britain exists, and surely, that being the case, we may refrain from excluding **British** goods under such drastic, uncertain, and undesirable provisions as exist in this part of the Bill.

* The Prime Minister quoted from a despatch from the Secretary of State for the .Colonies to the effect that this was practically the only way, owing to the complications which might arise between the **British** Government and the outside world.

* He would not do anything to weaken his own Government, would not vote against his Government, but he would not vote for them, as he held they had neglected their duty in neglecting to make the employment of **British** seamen a condition of mail contracts.

* We wish to see Britishers on **British** ships, and as a unit of the Labour Party, I shall always fight to gain that object."

* The **British** Government were always disinclined to hand over the care of the natives to the Government of Western Australia.

* After protracted negotiations a contract,- subject to ratification by the Australian  Commonwealth,  had been signed for ,120,000 per annum, for a period terminating on January 31, 1908, the date at which the present contract between the **British** Post Office and the Peninsular and Oriental Company would expire.

* An arrangement has been made that the **British** Government shall gradually withdraw the silver and copper coins now in circulation in Australia by purchasing from us .100,000 worth per annum.

* There is not a very large number of copper coins in circulation here, and if we were to gather them up in order to sell them to the **British** Government, we should not reap any substantial benefit.

* Under the arrangement which we have made with the **British** Government it will take about fifteen years to "withdraw from circulation the present silver coinage, and the withdrawal of the copper coins in Australia is not of pressing urgency.

* There is no intention on the part of the Government at present to deplete by sales to the **British** Government the quantity of copper coins in circulation in Australia ; nor do we propose to coin at present any coin in lieu of the penny.

* We have it on the authority of the **British** Government that the submarine is to revolutionize the whole of the coastal and harbor defences of the old country.

* The trouble is, however, that the officers of the **British** submarines are highly educated, technical experts, such as we have not within the Commonwealth.

* If the Commonwealth were to decide to adopt submarine defence, we should either have to train our officers on **British** vessels, or import **British** officers, and if we adopted the latter course, I can assure honorable members that those officers would not be bossed by any Captain Creswell.

* I have always recognised, the full force of this objection, that the **British** Parliament has no proper authority to legislate for foreigners out of its jurisdiction ; and I especially did so in the case of the Zollverein (1856), 2  Jur.

* No statute ought, therefore, to be held to apply to foreigners with respect to transactions out of **British** jurisdiction, unless the words of the statute are perfectly clear ; but I never said that, if it pleased the **British** Parliament to make such laws as to foreigners out of the jurisdiction, Courts of Justice must not execute them ; indeed, I said the direct contrary.

* These judgments make it very clear that Parliament has a perfect right to legislate' upon this matter, and the AttorneyGeneral will, I am sure, admit that the rights of this Parliament are identical with those of the **British** Parliament in that respect.

* The question of preference was not considered by the Tariff Commission, and, therefore, **British** goodswere included in the  15  per cent.

* Then we can help the **British** manufacturer to the extent of  10  per cent.

* Sixty years ago the coast of Australia was not so well defined by the **British** authorities as it is now.

* If the **British** Ministry in those times refused to allow even the Frenchmen, with their genius and with their high ideals of civilization, to appropriate part of Australia, we are equally justified in refusing to allow Asiatics to invade our shores.

* It is undesirable economically, because the competition between **British** workers and workers of this imported type is not an equal one.

* The latter can live upon a wage, as my noble friend has said, upon which an English workman would starve, and the result, therefore, must be either that the **British** workers are driven out of those employments which are affected by this competition altogether, or that, in the case of the women workers, they are forced to supplement their earnings from other sources.

* The noble and learned lord dwelt very much upon the politico-economical question of whether it would save **British** workmen from competition.

* But the adoption of a metric system ofweights and measures is decidedly a matter for consultation between the representatives of different parts of the Empire, because our transactions with the mother country and **British** Possessions are so extensive that the adoption of different systems of weights and measures would lead to much inconvenience and confusion.

* One or two **British** manufacturers have already been put to the expense of adopting double plants for the manufacture of machinery upon the **British** system of measures, and the metric system respectively.

* Those who have the direction of affairs  in  **British** communities always look to the soundness of the currency, and the Commonwealth Government .might verv well be trusted to observe the same caution that has been exercised in Great Britain and Canada.

* Are they prepared to endanger the growth of Australian manufactures by making the competition of **British** manufactures a reality?

* I remind honorable members that  Mr. Chamberlain,  in the early stages of this great controversy in the Mother Country, so lost himself in an eloquent peroration as to depict the time when **British** manufactures would have a free entry into the markets of the selfgoverning Dominions.

* He painted a bright picture of the opportunity that would be presented, when this door was opened, for **British** manufacture under some preferential arrangement.

* as to say that he did not wish to interfere with any colonial industries then in existence, but that the effect of his policy would in the future be this - that Australia, for instance, might preserve the little infants she had, but that there were to be no more infants in the manufacturing future of this country - that under the new policy the **British** manufacturer would provide what was wanted.

* In those clays of protection England would not' allow a foreign nation to send even 100 worth of goods to a **British** Colony unless they were first sent to an English port.

* What a magnificent spectacle free-trade Great Britain, with her liberal policy, now presents compared with the Great Britain of the Tory, days, when protection was rampant, when  she trampled on the people of Ireland and of every country over which the **British** flag flew,- in order to maintain the most iniquitous advantages at the expense of the people of her dependencies.

* Is the next step to be the imposition of a duty of 60 per cent, against foreign imports and of 50 per cent, against **British** imports?

* It would mean a difference of ro per cent, between the duties on foreign and **British** imports, instead of a difference of only 5 per cent.

* But it would at the same time mean a duty of 50 per cent, instead of 40 per cent, against **British** imports.

* They have made many false statements about the **British** people, but our worst enemies have never been insane or mean enough to make such an accusation as that quoted by the Treasurer this afternoon.

* I wonder if there is an honorable member opposite who will have the audacity to say that the general condition of the **British** people is worse than it was sixty or seventy or eighty years ago.

* We have slanders enough uttered against the old country outside the **British** Empire without manufacturing them in this Parliament.

* The **British** Navy will do what it can to keep our foes at a distance, but it could not protect our whole coastline, and it will be necessary for us to guard against the attacks of privateers or raiding cruisers which might evade the **British** Fleet and loot our towns.

* If in Great Britain it were held to have force, the **British** Government would cease to build vessels of war.

* I would vote for the expenditure of money upon useful vessels for our coastal defence, to co-operate if necessary with the **British** Fleet.

* Whilst we may rely upon the **British**  Navy  to do everything possible to keep a foe from our snores, and to render it unnecessary for us to call upon our land forces to repel an invader, we must not lose sight of the fact that our citizen soldiers, if properly trained, might prove of the greatest value as auxiliaries to the Imperial Defence Forces in the event of the mother country getting into death-grips with a powerful enemy.

* The honorable member for Kennedy reminds mc that since the affirmation by the Queensland Government of the treaty which was arrived at between- the **British** and Japanese Governments, the number of Japanese in Queensland has increased within eighteen months, or two years by over 3,000.

* It is said bysome of those who object to legislation of' this sort that, while we may be justified  in  keeping out Chinamen, Japanese, Manillamen, Malays, or Assyrians, we have no justification for attempting .to keep out of Australia the coloured **British** subjects of  His  Majesty the King.

* I would direct the attention of people who think in that way to the fact that the **British** Government today admit the power of this Commonwealth and of the people of Australia to differentiate between Indian **British** subjects and white **British** subjects, because they themselves differentiate between them.

* The **British** Government do not think of putting the Hindoo or any other native of India upon the same plane as the people of the United Kingdom.

* The ground I take is that the natives of India are **British** subjects and subjects only, whilst the people of the United Kingdom are citizens as well, and **British** subjects in Australia are citizens also.

* I do not believe that the **British** Government will object to our restricting or preventing the influx of Indian subjects into this Commonwealth, but if they do object it will be for them to treat their subjects in India as on the same plane as other **British** subjects, and give them local self-government.

* They will not do that, and I do not think they would be justified under the circumstances in doing it ; but the mere fact that they have not so far extended it, and that the people of India are subject races, governed by the **British** people, owing to their superior intelligence and powers of organization, justifies us in expecting from the **British** Government treatment different from that accorded to the subjects of **British** India.

* The Natal Act was, I admit, the outcome of a series of negotiations with the **British** Government, but as indicated the day before yesterday, in connexion with another matter, there is, I think, a considerable distinction between the position occupied, in regard to negotiations with the **British** Government, by a single State, or single dependency, and that occupied by a federation of States such as the Commonwealth of Australia.

* Consequently we can quite understand that where the **British** Government might not agree to go the whole distance with regard to restrictive legislation of this character passed by a single State, they might take a different view and be much more liberal in their treatment of proposals coming from a body like this, representing such an important section of the **British** Empire.

* **British** South Africa were in 1907 28,266,525, the exports 48,390,763, the total trade being 76,657,288.

* It will be unnecessary for us to continue our contributions to the **British** Navy, because this will enable us to build a- navy of our own at reduced cost.

* That is why the Auxiliary Squadron was created under the control  to a certain extent of the **British** Admiralty.

* instruments of warfare, and would be able to" strike a severe blow at **British** commerce.

* Judging from this, their policy has been in the' direction of giving every attention to the military forces, and allowing the naval forces to be handed over to the control of the **British** Government.

* We find, however, that the Government have practically handed over the navy - -which should be the most important branchof our defences - to the **British** Government.

* If that Government is best qualified to deal with our naval defence, why should it not also arrange for our military defence  1  Why should not the Commonwealth Government, in the name of economy, and at the shrine of Kyabram, abolish the Department of Defence, translate the worthy Minister in charge of that Department to some other sphere, and hand over the whole control of the naval and military defences of the Commonwealth to the **British** Government?

* That is to say, if an alien is stopped from landing, he has no right of action in **British** courts to enforce the payment of damages for trespass.

* So far as men being paupers is concerned, we have to recollect that some of the best men - nien of enterprise, men of intelligence, men through whom the **British** Empire has become what it is - landed on these shores practically " stone broke."

* There is another reason which actuates some **British** statesmen in their desire not to offend Japan or even China.

* There is about 300,000,000 of **British** capital invested in China.

* I do not believe in passing a makeshift, or in taking up a Bill which was opposed by the **British** press, and which, when introduced in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, was not proceeded with.

* But I would point out that there is a considerable difference between the position of men belonging to the **British** Army and of troops who have not volunteered to enlist as permanent soldiers but have volunteered for the express purpose of serving in South Africa for the duration of the present campaign, in order to endeavour by every means in their power to bring it to a close.

* Would he ask the **British** to submit to the few Boers who are carrying on the present guerilla, warfare ?

* It is granting a great deal and putting a most charitable construction on an egregious blunder to say that the Government have been tricked, because in the very front of the message occurs the word" policy," which at once suggests politics, and places it beyond all doubt that a public meeting called to support the **British** policy in South Africa must be a party political meeting.

* The Government are awaiting final replies from the High Commissioner of the Western Pacific and the **British** Resident in the New Hebrides.

* During the debate, the honorable member for Grey has made several references to the **British** Medical Association.

* I refer to the **British** Medical Association, which is supposed by the honorable member to be a union of doctors for their own purposes.

* The honorable member is doubtless possessed of more information on the subject than am I, but I should like to inform the Committee of the real objects  and the  raison d'etre  of the **British** Medical Association.

* With regard to the **British** Medical Association, any man who is an honorable man, and a legally qualified medical practitioner, may join its ranks.

* He may join the ranks of the **British** Medical Association if he is an honorable man, and if he behaves himself in such a manner - that is to say, in such an honorable manner, for it is all a question of honour--- 
In England, where the parent branch of the association exists, the judge is the Medical Council, which is composed of doctors, some of whom are nominated by the Government, and others elected by the profession.

* What they look to is to prevent any man being a member of the **British** Medical Association who is guilty of unprofessional practice.

* Advertising is not allowed amongst members of the medical profession in England, whether they be members of the **British** Medical Association or not.

* The **British** Medical Association in these States comprises but a few of the members of the medical profession.

* The point is, that although the **British** Medical Association may be termed, as the honorable member for Dalley termed it, a labour union- 
There is nothing political in its rules, and I should further like to point out that it is a voluntary association.

* There is no compulsion upon any man to join the **British** Medical Association, the Victorian or New South Wales Medical Societies, or the Clinical Society of Brisbane, or any other of these associations.

* I can point to members of the medical profession residing in Collins -street to-day, who are making large incomes, and who are outside of the **British** Medical Association.

* The difficulty which occurred amongst the medical profession in Adelaide, as the honorable gentleman must know, had nothing whatever to do with the **British** Medical Association.

* It was the result of a quarrel between the medical men, who were running the Adelaide hospital, and the South Australian Government, and had nothing whatever to do with the **British** Medical Association.

* We have had a great many taunts levelled at the **British** Medical Association.

* **British** Medical Association.

* I admit that one of the matters dealt with by the Council of the **British** Medical Association, in the interests of the medical profession, is that to which the honorable member for Grey has referred.

* Dealing with the amendment, I am pointing out that over and over again during the course of the debate, the **British** Medical Association has been referred to as a union, and I have been endeavouring to inform honorable members as .

* Why should we endeavour to force upon any Power an exclusion law, naming or describing its subjects, before we have made reasonable efforts, either directly or through the **British** Government, to negotiate an exclusion treaty?

* **British** Columbia has been worried considerably by the Japanese for some years past, and local laws have been passed for the exclusion of the Japanese, but the Dominion of Canada has vetoed no less than fifteen Acts of Parliament that were passed by the Legislature of **British** Columbia, for the reason that these Acts were contrary to the comity of nations, and contrary to the principles of law and administration recognised by the Dominion of Canada.

* In March, 1900, a proposal was submitted to the Canadian Parliament to impose a poll tax, with a view to prevent the influx of Japanese into **British** Columbia, and  Mr. Mills,  the Minister for Justice, then stated, on behalf of the Government, that it would not be in the interests of Canada to adopt hostile legislation against Japanese immigrants.

* In the Canadian House of Commons in June, 1900, the Government were urged to secure the passage of a law similar to the Asiatics Immigration Law in Natal, in order to prevent the influx of Japanese into **British** Columbia.

* Sir Wilfred  Laurier then said -  
In the foregoing remarks the word  defence  does not appear, it is omitted advisedly, because the primary object of the **British** Navy is not to defend anything, but to attack the fleets of the enemy, and, by defeating them, to afford protection to **British** Dominions, shipping, and commerce.

* The traditional  role  of the **British** Navy is not to act on the defensive, but to prepare to attack the force which threatens - in other words, to assume the offensive.

* Whether it has not been agreed between the **British** and Commonwealth Governments that letters from England bearing the full postage at the1d.

* Mines prefer **British** make owing to superior material and longer experience of manufacture.

* I suggested in connexion with the consideration of one of the earlier sections of the Constitution that we should expressly declare that the powers of the Governor-General were to be exercised according to the conventions of the **British** Constitution.

* As the Bill left us originally, it attached to the granting of preference to **British** goods the condition that those goods should have been brought out in **British** ships, and that condition was to operate forthwith.

* We, dealing with the same matter, declared that we would forego our requirement as to the goods being brought out in **British** ships, and that we would reject the suggestion of the Senate that that condition should attach from next August.

* What would happen if, in connexion with the great May Day celebrations, with which the Labour Party are, I believe, in close sympathy, it were whispered along the ranks of international labour that if one German Socialist were found on a **British** ship, the Federal Labour Party would ban everything in that ship from the benefit of this preference.

* genealogical tree of all the persons engaged on a particular ship, and, having made sure that they had at last found a vessel on which only white **British** seamen were employed, might place their goods on board her.

* When that vessel reached Hobson's Bay, however, it might suddenly be discovered that among the crew was the son of an American father by a **British** mother, born in the United States.

* What is much more serious is the provision requiring direct importation in **British** ships.

* The **British** Government will not thank us for raising that question, since.it is computed that the **British** flag covers half the cargoes of the world; so that an immense quantity of foreign goods is conveyed in **British** bottoms.

* Practically all the **British** goods coming here are imported in **British** ships, and while the provision to which I refer has been inserted with the best intentions, it may, instead of improving **British** trade, have very serious consequences, and embarrass the mother country.

* Under these circumstances, it appeared to the Government that, before taking any definite step forward, it was imperative to obtain fuller advice, not simply from the Colonial Defence Committee, but from the Imperial Defence Committee, the highest authority in the **British** Empire.

* The administration of **British** New Guinea constitutes a new element in Australian politics, and is a matter which requires very careful and judicious treatment.

* Under these circumstances, it is absolutely necessary that the officers appointed to administer Papua should be able to grasp the full significance of  the  momentous questions which must in time arise between German and **British** settlers, for they will constitute our sole source of information.

* A **British** citizen, no matter how humble he may be, or where he may.

* be residing, is entitled to **British** fair play and justice,' and the cases mentioned by the honorable member for Kennedy - if his statement be correct - amount to a public scandal- 
I do not.

* The Germans have practically boycotted the **British** shipping which has hitherto participated in the trade of the Solomon Islands.

* From what I understood the Prime Minister to say, it appears that it would be unconstitutional for this Commonwealth to take over **British** New Guinea except under certain conditions ; but what these conditions are I do not quite gather.

* How any man can conceive it possible that **British** New Guinea, lying adjacent to our shores - within a stone's throw, so to speak - being to all intents and purposes part of Australia, can be permitted, as it were, to lie, a pearl in the Pacific Ocean, waiting for some marauder to it pick up, I cannot understand.

* These ungodly marauders - pirates - have been engaged in picking the eyes out of the best land that the blood of the English race has won ; not for the good of the **British** Empire, but for the good of a handful of exploiters, who, taking no risks, have simply " scooped the pool."

* We should prevent every alienation of land, and should secure such healthy social, moral, and industrial conditions ia the island as will insure to every man in it - that is to say, every native in it - that he shall at least not have a worse time under the dominion of the **British** Empire than he has hitherto had.

* We have been told that the **British** people are the only people who can colonize successfully.

* Is that because the **British** Government stands behind her colonists?

* More, if the honorable member pleases ; but I say as many, and so far as those nations are concerned, it has not been possible for them to make the success of colonization that the **British** people have done.

* It is encouraging to know that penny post has been successful ' in all **British** countries in which it has been tried.

* , **British** Possessions 18.81 per cent., and with foreign countries 28.9 per cent., so that our trade with the United Kingdom and **British** Possessionslast year was about 71 per cent., as against about 29 per cent.

* Our whole trade, including imports and exports, in 1901, was, with the United Kingdom 54.74 per cent., **British** Possessions 18.20 per cent., foreign countries 27.06 per cent.

* In 1895, ten years ago, the percentage of imports was - From the United Kingdom 71.61, from **British** Possessions 11.46, and from foreign countries 16.93.

* In  I005&gt; those percentages were - From the United Kingdom 60.17, from **British** Possessions 14.04, and from foreign countries 25.79.

* It would, therefore, appear that foreign countries are gradually increasing their trade with Australia, that our imports from the old country are gradually decreasing, and that **British** Possessions are holding their own.

* I also had the honour of an interview with Lord Goschen, who, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, carried out the ,gre.it scheme under which nearly ^600,000,000 worth of **British** stock was converted.

* The conclusions I have arrived at after carefully considering the opinions expressed by those whom I have had the privilege of consulting are contained in a memorandum I addressed to the Prime Minister as follows :  - 
We inquired from the **British** Mint authorities whether any inconvenience would arise if our coin were the same size as the **British** coin, and we received a reply in the negative.

* We made an inquiry from the **British** Mint authorities here as to the coins that we ought to import, and we were given to understand that a good many half-crowns should be imported.

* It is true that attention has been drawn to the fact that those Colonies which impose high protective duties make it difficult for **British** manufacturers to extend their trade, and that they would be glad to see a reduction of duties.

* It has been clearly indicated by the cable news from Great Britain within the last few days that the advocates of preferential trade are disappointed because it is not proposed to give preference to Great Britain by means of lowering the duties as against **British** goods.

* If French manufacturers wished to export their goods to Australia and to obtain the advantage of the preference accorded to **British** manufactures, they would establish works in Great Britain.

* From every platform we shall shortly hear of the advantages that would result from according preference to Great Britain, and of the danger of German competition with **British** manufacturers in the markets of Australia and other parts of the world.

* We shall be told that **British** trade is decaying, whereas, as a matter of fact, it is now expanding.

* They have been developed during these lateryears by a number of persons who are not of **British** origin, and who are not imbued with **British** ideas.

* But the Government of Great Britain will decline to have an Excise officer in every factory to ascertain whether partially manufactured goods, which constitute the raw material of **British** manufacturers, are of foreign origin.

* The Government propose to give a preference to **British** goods carried in **British** bottoms.

* It would be much better to collect on **British** imports the duties imposed on like imports from other countries, and out of the revenue so derived to return to the **British** people an amount representing the difference in duties that we desire to make in their favour.

* We have no guarantee that if the motion be carried- one penny of the advantage gained by importers of **British** goods in **British** bottoms will reach the workers of Great Britain.

* The price of imports of **British** goods which cannot be manufactured here will be determined by that of similar imports from other countries, so that we shall lose a considerable amount of revenue without reaping any advantage.

* If the policy initiated by the Government is to be carried to its logical conclusion, it means that all the **British** peoples are to lean on each other.

* Does the honorable member for Franklin think the community of feeling among **British** people a mere fleeting thing?

* The difference between the rates of duties on foreign and **British** imports ma;; be sufficient to prevent industries from growing up here.

* The "nations of the world are conducting their affairs each in its own way ; but I believe that the **British** system of government is the best yet discovered, and that the cause of its success is that its underlying principle is expressed in the words " righteousness exalteth a nation."

* If, in the opinion of the Federal Government, it became necessary for the squadron to join forces with the **British** fleet in some other part of the world, I am sure that no obstacle would be placed in the way of the adoption of that course.

* I do not know whether the Prime Minister has yet received any definite information from the Home Government in regard to the Joint Commission in the New Hebrides, or as to **British** action in these matters.

* There is a school which thinks that the scene of strife will be not at any remote distance from the **British**' Isles, and I do not wish even here to particularize the possible nations with whom Great Britain may be in conflict then.

* Yet, in spite of that, I regret to say that the **British** Government appears to find it impossible to act in any definite and firm manner with regard to the continual acquisition, by other nations, of permanent settlements in the South Pacific.

* Having had an opportunity of observing more carefully than others may have had the possibilities of the situation, I say unhesitatingly that the acquisition of the New Hebrides affects Australia as a portion of the **British** Empire much more vitally than their acquisition by France affects the French Republic.

* It might have been thirty years ago to all intents and purposes if the **British** Government at that time had only recognised the fact.

* It is a peculiarity of the **British** people in most countries that they have not applied themselves to the minor industries.

* I stated that if the Natal Act proved unsatisfactory, we could go to the **British** Government with irresistible force for the Bill which I had previously introduced.

* It is as follows :  - 
Any attempt to impose disqualifications on the base of such distinctions,, besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of **British** rule throughout the Empire.

* We have acknowledged that **British** enterprise has suffered severely from the competition of Germany.

* Germans because of their skill and their commercial acumen, which enable them to undersell **British** productions in many of the markets of the world.

* Therefore, we wish to give **British** manufacturers a preference.

* So far as **British** goods are concerned, I am only asking the Committee to reduce the importers' margin by  5  per cent.

* Their possibility of rearrangement and better management has not yet been exhausted, and an increased duty of  5  per cent, as against **British** imports is not an insurmountable difficulty to them.

* So far as Germany is concerned, I only ask for a preference of  5  per cent, to **British** imports, and an increase of  10  per cent, on the original duty.

* Captain Collins has done very well in the position he has occupied in London, but he has not been called upon as the High Commissioner will be to entertain the leading men of Great Britain and some of the most prominent men in the **British** Dominions.

* They assure me that Lord Milner is astray, for the reason that he is surrounded by those whose interests are in the direction of obtaining cheap labour with which to work the Rand mines rather than of securing a permanent and satisfactory settlement of the Transvaal with a white and practically **British** population.

* Prior to the outbreak of hostilities in South Africa, had any one asked my opinion of the **British** Army, I should have said that the Imperial authorities could place in the field 250,000 trained and disciplined troops, who were able to face those of any other country in the world.

* The **British** Army, when it was tried', failed, and it' requires no great stretch of imagination to conceive that, in assuming the **British** Fleet to be equal to any two fleets, we may make a similar mistake.

* If one link in the chain of our first line of defence were to give way, how long could Hong Kong, the second port in the world - the seat of the **British** Navy in the East - hold out?

* Therefore,- it requires no wide stretch of imagination to conceive that the **British** Navy may fail us in a moment of need, just as the Army did.

* In the recent South African campaign, the ordnance of the Boers out-ranged the **British** cannon, but did not prove more effective because of the poor quality of the ammunition which was supplied to them by private firms.

* In  The Swiss Confederation,  a standard work by  Sir Francis 
Yes, but if we once admit the principle that we are to contribute money over which we are to have no control ; that we are to pour money into the great gulf of the **British** naval expenditure, then we shall have no ground for objecting when we are asked to contribute our proportion according to our population or according to our trade.

* It partakes more of the nature of a chamber or a board than of a court, but, at the same time, it contains some of the best jurists in the **British** Empire, and there is a good deal to be said in favour of the contention that **British** law ought always to keep a connexion with the parent stock.

* There is no system of law so great as was the Roman law, for the Roman Empire, except perhaps the **British** law.

* To hope that the principles of **British** freedom, which are involved in **British** law, shall extend all' over the Empire is a great ideal to cherish.

* The comments referred to are probably due to a misapprehension as to the ultimate effects on **British** trade by the operation of the proposed Tariff.

* It is simply  a  recognition of the fact that the development of these islands by people of **British** origin and the encouragement of trade with them, will tend very largelyto increase oursecurity.

* Let them pass from the sphere of **British** influence, and we can well imagine what will be the position of Australia should Great Britain become embroiled with any of the nations in possession of them.

* Our only means of defence against aggression is the presence of the **British** Fleet.

* I feel certain that the Prime Minister realizes the enormous possibilities of abnormal developments in the Pacific in the almost immediate future, and that he recognises the necessity of trying to keep under the **British** flag as many of the islands as possible.

* If we once allow our trading facilities to fall below their present standard, it will simply mean that the islands at present under **British** control, may, in a short time, pass under the domination of some nation, which, in time, may become a hostile power.

* It is by approaching the States and ascertaining whether they will be prepared to come to some agreement with regard to the 'disposal of the waters of the Murray - and Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, are the three States concerned - that we shall be able to solve the problem of offering to the **British** people the greatest attraction that could possibly be extended to them.

* Do they propose that  Ave  shall admit **British** goods into our markets free of duty?

* When, however, the limits of operations had extended to such an extent as to imperil the stability and even the very existence of the nation, I confess that my opinions changed, and I became a very whole-souled advocate of the cause of the **British**.

* Here was a racial war carried on with that determination and tenacity which might be expected to mark a struggle between two such races as the **British** and the Dutch.

* There is but one solution, and that is that there shall be attracted to South Africa a resident population of **British** white subjects. '

* That being admitted to be the case, and every effort being made to secure that end -  Mr. Chamberlain  having gone through South Africa in the manner of the consuls of old, pointing out very hopefully, indeed, the signs of eventual settlement - the **British** Government now lends itself to an ordinance which practically sounds the death-knell of any effort to settle white people upon the lands of the Transvaal.

* Since, then, we are committed to the destinies of this Empire, and since, undeniably, the introduction of Chinese labour will not only tend towards, but will certainly bring about depopulation and disaster, and will ultimately ruin any prospects of white settlement in the Transvaal, and of the **British** supremacy in South Africa; and since that, in its turn, will affect us, seeing that we have to take our share of the whole burden of the Empire, and that our share must necessarily be increased when some other part of the Empire is unable to do its part - therefore we have every right at this juncture, as a component part of the Empire, to say that this action of the Legislative Council of the Transvaal is fraught with danger and is a direct refusal to carry out that implied compact which was made when we went to war against the Dutch.

* There was then undeniably an understanding, expressed or implied, that one of the reasons why we ought to go to war was that the **British** population of the Transvaal had been denied the franchise.

* These men were throughout the South African war patriots who prated about the extension of the Empire, and their concern for their fellow **British** subjects.

* Their very names are unfamiliar to us, and are not those by which **British** subjects are usually known.

* But, these men, if they be indeed Britishers, propose to do so grievous a wrong to their fellow **British** citizens that nothing which the Boers ever did to them can equal it.

* The press bade us turn to see the result of excluding white **British** subjects under contract from this country, and said - " See the effect that this legislation will have upon the capitalists of Great Britain."

* These men now propose to say to **British** subjects, not in a fair and honorable way : " You must not come here," but, " You may come out, but if you do you will be reduced to a depth of penury and distress such as is hardly ever known in England or elsewhere."

* But they will offer the right hand of fellowship, not to **British** white subjects, nor even to **British** Chinese subjects - they do not even make the miserable pretence that the Chinamen whom they are to import to the Rand will be drawn from Hong Kong, and will consequently be **British** subjects - but to any 
Chinese labourer whose services ' they can obtain.

* I do not think we shall offend the susceptibilities of Great Britain, because, as has been pointed out, the proposal to introduce Chinese into the Transvaal narrowly escaped defeat in the **British** Parliament, in spite of the cracking of the party whip.

* It is true that the **British** Parliament, affected, of course, by party considerations, decided by a narrow majority in favour of the Ordinance.

* But the **British** Government have learned from the closeness of the division that it is best to put off the evil day ; and under cover of endeavouring to discover from the Chinese Government under what conditions the Chinese will be allowed to emigrate, the Ordinance has not been put into effect.

* There is plenty of room, as between the two sets of duties, to assist the **British** manufacturer and to keep out the goods of foreign countries.

* We are prpposing to grant Great Britain a substantial preference - a preference which, according to the reports of the officers of the Department of Trade and Customs, will apply, at the outset, to **British** imports of the value of something like  1,200,000  per annum, and will gradually extend to  1,500,000  worth per annum.

* Therefore, it cannot be denied that we are proposing to giant **British** imports a fairly substantial preference.

* Judging by some of the statements published in the **British** press, and referred to in cablegrams appearing in Australian journals, the people of the Old Country are beginning to realize that we are offering them a substantial preference.

* I was glad to learn, judging by thewayin which my reference to it in the course of the Budget statement was received, that a majority of honorable members apparently were in favour of a preference being granted to **British** imports, and that they approved of the proposals we have made in that respect.

* Then we have yet another issue which may probably arise, and that is the question of a preference to **British** goods.

* proved to be of **British** origin.

* I suggest a duty which, I believe, is a right and proper one to protect the revenue under ordinary conditions, but beyond that I would give an opportunity to the Postmaster-General and other members of the Committee to show that they are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices which they have so often declared their willingness to make in connexion with goods which are entirely of **British** origin.

* They are undoubtedly influencing the present situation in Canada, but their influence is on the wane, and the **British** race there will ultimately prevail as it has done in every part of the world, because its principles are founded upon justice and freedom, and a determination to do what is right in the sight of God and of man.

* I am here as a loyal subject of the **British** Crown.

* There is one means of resistance, and only one which can be effectively opposed to that desire - the settlement of **British** people in South Africa in larger numbers than the Dutch.

* We know the settlement which has' taken place in the western States of America, whither population was first attracted by the golden metal there; and we have seen the settlement in Australia due to the floods of persons of **British** and other races who were drawn to our shores by the same attraction.

* Therefore, I was in hope that **British** settlement in South' Africa would be encouraged by giving every opportunity for white people to enter the mines of that country.

* ment of many others, and when it comes to the question whether servile aliens or white **British** settlers shall be imported, I say that, leaving the immediate interests out' of .

* consideration, and looking to the future greater interests of the Empire, we shoul'd 'endeavour to encourage the settle^ ment of a white **British** population in South Africa, as that will prove the strongest rampart against the inroads of the Dutch.

* In time, especially if the hopelessness of rebellion is shown by the fact that the population is becoming more and more **British**, the racial antipathy which now exists in South Africa will die, and, as in other **British** possessions, the Dutch there, forgetting the past, and finding that they are treated with justice and equity, will become loyal members of the Empire.

* Before the **British** Government take such a serious step as to sanction the introduction of large numbers of 'coloured aliens, before they lose the opportunity that now presents itself to increase the **British** population in South Africa, a strong, genuine, and earnest attempt should be made to see if the mining industry there cannot bs conducted by white labour, assisted by the native blacks.

* If 25,000 **British** settlers were added to the population of the Transvaal they would afford a very great safeguard to the **British** Empire in South Africa.

* Our re' presentation has now been made, and without meeting with objection on the part of the **British** Government.

* If I did not believe that we were prepared to again do that service - prepared again, if need be, to come to the rescue of the **British** Government in South Africa - I should say that we had no right to raise our voice upon the question now under discussion.

* How would the **British** Government view a resolution of that kind?

* The **British** Government, which has ever shown its willingness to grant responsible government when a people are ready for it, felt that the residents of the Transvaal were not ready, and declined, for a time at any rate, to let them settle questions' of public importance by their own votes.

* That being so, it seems to me rather extraordinary to suggest that a vote on such an important question should be given by those who, according to the present view of the **British** Government, should not be allowed to exercise- such a privilege.

* It might very well occur to them that the .introduction of **British** white labour would have the effect of reducing them to the position of a minority.

* He said that the **British** nation was great because it was **British**.

* I should like to point out to the honorable gentleman that the **British** nation is not wholly **British**, is not, indeed, even largely **British**.

* I say that the **British** Empire is great because its rulers, in handling some of the most varied races of the earth, have always recognised that right and justice must govern their intercourse with, and their control of, these people- that the black-skinned, as well as the white-skinned must receive justice.

* If we depart from those great principles, there is nothing more certain than that we shall lose our hold upon those races, and that, whilst the **British** nation then might be more **British**, it would certainly be less great.

* I am sure that every honorable member thoroughly appreciates the loyalty of the honorable member for Richmond, and would go to the same lengths in declaring his attachment to the **British** Empire.

* During his speech I made an interjection, which I may be permitted to enlarge upon for a few moments, to the effect that, after all, it is our loyalty to the **British** Empire, and our admiration for **British** institutions, that makes us so anxious to preserve the **British** character of our population.

* We do not claim any separate power of legislation; we claim simply the right to legislate for part of the **British** Empire, knowing perfectly well that our enactments must receive the Imperial sanction.

* I think that the honorable member for Richmond, in his desire to perpetuate the **British** connexion, and to show his fervent loyalty to the Empire, has altogether forgotten the fact that our prime duty is to pass legislation for the good government of the people of Australia.

* The people of Australia are too thoroughly determined to have this coloured immigration cease and to protect the **British** character of the population of this Commonwealth to tolerate any factious opposition to a measure of this kind.'

* And, because honorable members stand up in this House and say that inherently in this Bill is absolute failure to bring about the desired result, and instead of putting this tortuous and dishonest measure on the statutebook of the Commonwealth, prefer, with our new national life, and with our mandate under that instrument, to say directly to the **British** Government what we mean, are we to be told that we are disloyal to the old country?

* I hold that the greatest privilege which any man on earth can enjoy is that of being a **British** citizen.

* I -would sacrifice all I possess in the world, and would, if necessary, give up my life for the **British** connexion.

* But when I took my oath as a member of this House, I took not merely the oath of allegiance to the King of England but of loyalty to this Constitution which has been passed by the **British**  Parliament.

* I hold that in the great struggle which is taking place upon this Bill, the object which we have at heart is as much the safeguarding of **British** interests in the Pacific as the safeguarding of Australian interests.

* It is absolutely necessary for the freedom of England - for the upholding of the **British** flag in the Pacific, and for the future power of the Englishspeaking people; - that we shall keep this fortress in the Pacific true to the **British** race.

* If, on the other hand, we are going to allow **British** and foreign ships to trade here, but to compel them to increase their fares and freights, then we shall again strike a very heavy blow at our exporters.

* Figures have been quoted from this side of the Chamber to show that the local shipping companies are very successful in their competition with **British** and foreign companies; that they earn huge profits, pay good dividends, and build up huge reserve funds, while paying the Australian rate of wages.

* That being, so, and remembering that the ultimate intention of the Government is to keep Australian trade to Australian and **British** ships, to the exclusion of foreign ships, I think that the matter is one for the investigation of the tribunal which the Government have already created to report upon navigation matters generally.

* The decisions might be those of the **British** Board of Trade, for example.

* The **British** Admiralty used to perform such work, and I wish to know whether we are now expected to defray the cost of marine survey work, because we are subsidizing the Australian Squadron?

* The evidence will, amongst other things, bear upon the differentiation of duties between **British** made and foreign goods.

* I have been informed that the proposed duty will not have the effect of extending to **British** manufacturers a preference such as the Government expect.

* The consequence will be that the trust as a whole will bear the proposed io- per cent, duty, and the **British** companies will pay their proportion of it in common with the Continental members of the trust.

* Where, then, is the value of the proposed preference of 10 per cent, to **British** fuse?

* They desire that a duty shall be levied upon **British** fuse, as well as upon fuse from other countries, They principally desire a duty upon **British** fuse, because it is their chief competitor.

* They affirm that **British** manufacturers are endeavouring to bulldose them, to undersell them, and to prevent them from obtaining their powder.

* I believe that quite recently a Bill was introduced into the **British** House of Commons by  Sir Walter  Foster that provided for old-age pensions for persons who had reached the age of 65 or over.

* In conclusion, I would ask honorable members to try to realize what the  4,000,000  of **British** people in Australia have done and are doing.

* I am glad to say that  71  per cent, of this trade was with the people of the **British** Empire - our own people - the remaining  29  per cent, being with the people of foreign countries.

* This is what the people of Australia -  4,000,000  **British** people - are doing.

* Individually, far removed from the crowded centres of the old world, and its grinding competition - in a sunny land, with healthy and pleasant surroundings, where there is plenty of room for all to make a living, and even gain a competence - surely we may rejoice that our " walks" are " by the long wash of Australasian seas," and that we have the opportunity and the privilege - 

 Mr. FISHER.We are not founding our legislation on **British** precedents.

* The supremacy of the **British** merchant service is even more unquestioned than that of the **British** Navy.

* No nation, however, can afford to burn the candle atboth ends; and when we find, as we do in the shipping return just issued by the Board of Trade, that in every direction **British** shipping is losing ground, while our trade rivals are improving their position by leaps and bounds, it is desirable that we should not disregard the information.

* Last year the **British** shipping entered and cleared in our ports for foreign countries showed a decrease of considerably over two millions of steam, tonnage.

* The Suez Canal statistics, which are a capital index to foreign trade, tell the same mournful story - a huge **British** decrease and a large increase on the part of Germany and other maritime nations.

* The figures dealing with the manning of **British** ships are not more reassuring.

* Nor are we training a new generation of **British** sailors ?

* There is no necessity to be pessimistic, but these figures cannot be lightly dismissed by **British** statesmen.

* An effort must be made to find a remedy.We cannot and do not wish to prevent other nations from increasing their trade, but there is no reason why we should allow the Empire to lose its place without a struggle, or abandon our ships to the foreign seaman who is fast displacing the genuine **British** tar.

* The Americans **British** rivals, in reply to this attempt to capture English custom, have promised to give the retailers, on condition that they do business solely with the **British** trust, a share in its profits.

* The honorable member for Dalley  has very properly pointed out that when the Prime Minister went to London to attend the Imperial Conference he made a distinct representation to the **British** Government that the people of.

* The honorable gentleman, as the honorable member for Dalley has stated, certainly did represent when in the Conference that the people of Australia were unfavorable to the continuance of a money contribution' to the **British** Navy.

* The honorable member at the outset of his speech said something about not objecting to this proposed vote as an earnest to the **British** Government of what we propose to do.

* I object to this sum of 250,000 being voted as an earnest to the **British** Government that we are in favour of the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister.

* This Parliament in 1903, passed a Bill establishinga solemn compact between the **British** Government and Australia that a ten years' contribution of 200,000 per annum should be made by us for certain naval services.

* It may be that the **British** Government, in their desire to placate Australia, as one of its colonial possessions, may be perfectly willing to forego that agreement- 
The correspondence clearly shows that if we cease to recognise the undertaking into which we entered with the **British** naval authorities,' the  ships of war which are now constantly in, or in the neighbourhood of, Australia will be immediately removed to the Indian and China seas.

* Because the **British** naval authorities have already announced - if the Minister had read Lord Tweedmouth's speech he would be aware of the fact - that in the event of the agreement being cancelled, the ships will be removed to the China and Indian seas to become part of the **British** Fleet in those quarters.

* For instance, instead of proposing to construct torpedo destroyers, or submarines, they might propose to build one huge battleship - a project which the House would regard as an utter absurdity unless it is to be a contribution to the **British** Navy.

* I do not think this vote is to be used even to show the **British** people that  we indorse the statement of the Prime Minister that we desire the Naval Agreement to be either modified or ended.

* The honorable member for Flinders declared that he did not think we were justified in pressing for the production of the correspondence which has taken place between the **British** naval authorities and the Prime Minister in regard to this matter.

* Cables published subsequently show that the **British** naval authorities , regard the handing over of an Australian flotilla to the CommanderinChief, in time of war, as a condition precedent to any further arrangement between themselves and theCommonwealth.

* morally binding upon us and upon the people of Australia- 
There may be a difference of opinion as to the meaning of the phrase " morally binding," but I can only say that the representations which were made in London by the Prime Minister have certainly led the people of Great Britain - and even the **British** naval authorities - to believe that we are in favour of the views which he expressed.

* Although months have elapsed since the Imperial Conference terminated, we have never yet had an opportunity - except by means of occasional and intermittent expressions of opinion - of telling the **British** naval authorities that there is any doubt about the truth or untruth of the representations made by the Prime Minister.

* The leader of the Opposition placed in the forefront of his challenge the action of the Government in offering to the **British** authorities a  Dreadnought,  or its equivalent.

* In no craven spirit, in no nervous manner, with no trembling attitude, he seeks to impress his fellow countrymen with his conviction that a great crisis is before them which will need every effort on their part to maintain **British** prestige.

* The Conference is to enable the best, most skilled, and experienced judgment of the most capable men in the **British** navy and army to be collected for the purpose of advising the Empire on national defence.

* It used to be 'said that the policy of  laissez faire  was supreme in **British** Departments.

* Instead of furnishing a field for the employment of thousands of **British** subjects, it has become a den of Chinese slavery.

* By the aid of the gold mines, the country should have been settled by **British** people, who would have purchased **British** goods from **British** manufacturers, and would have carried **British** guns if the nation had ever become involved in war.

* Australia is the last resort for the **British** race.

* His Majesty's Government have at no lime had the intention to interfere wilh the action of the responsible Government of Natal, ot to control Governor in exercise of prerogative, but that Ministers would recognise that in all the circumstances then existing, and in view of the presence of **British** troops in the Colony,  His  Majesty's Government were entitled, an..l were in duty bound, to obtain full and precise information as to these martial law cases 
It is clear, then, that all that  His  Majesty's Government in London wished to do, as they had to be responsible for war or peace, and for the army and navy, was that, before any irrevocable step was taken, they should know exactly why certain things were done.

* But I think it will be recognised that it was only reasonable in the circumstances, with **British**, troops in the Colony expected to enforce the decrea of some martial persons for the shooting of those twelve kaffirs, that the **British** Government should know what they were about.

* The Prime Minister appears to think that it is a very wrong thing to send messages to the King, but I would remind honorable members that, much as the Prime Minister deplores the interference of the Home Government in only asking for information, it was by the interfer ence of the House of Commons and the House of Lords that slavery was abolished throughout the **British** Dominions, against the wishes of the local Parliaments.

* I admit that those Parliaments were conservative and reactionary bodies, composed of slave-holders, or those interested in slavery ; but they were local Parliaments nevertheless, and slavery would not have been abolished throughout the **British** Dominions had it not been for the interposition, about eighty years ago, of the supreme power of the Imperial Parliament.

* Consequently we are doubly bound asa Parliament to deal carefully with the interest of the people when we ourselves are doing an illegal act - an act which, however, is essential, and which a law-abiding and common-sense people like the **British** in every community are willing to pass over.

* It is also more than probable that long distance cruisers will occasionally be able to evade the **British** Fleets engaged in blockading the ports of our enemies.

* In time of war the duty of the English fleets would be to, as far as possible, blockade the ports of the enemy ; but single cruisers might now and again succeed in slipping through the cordon of **British** warships, and afterwards try to damage the mercantile marine of Great Britain.

* If is the naval base for the **British** Squadron in these seas ; and, although I quite understand that the Imperial authorities undertake the protection of their bases, we cannot ignore the fact that Sydney is specially liable to attack on account ' of its being the head-quarters, and of containing the war munitions of the Admiralty in Australia.

* to agree to the adoption of a new scheme under which a **British** fleet, under, direct control of the Admiralty, would be stationed in Australian waters under such conditions that Australia would be called upon ' to contribute only half the estimated annual cost.

* If we sought to assume the sole command of the squadron in times of emergency, we should be asking for something which was never contemplated by the agreement, and something which we have no right to claim considering the smallness of our contribution, I am absolutely against a joint control of an important portion of the **British** Navy, and I could not support an amendment which aims at exercising control, not only over the proposed vessels of the Australian Squadron, but over any additional war-ships which might be stationed in Australian waters.

* If half the vessels of the **British** fleet were stationed in Commonwealth waters, we could, if the amendment were adopted, prevent them from being removed elsewhere.

* Whilst I should be perfectly willing to allow the decision of the question of whether or not the squadron should be permitted to strengthen another portion of the **British** fleet elsewhere to rest with" the people of Australia, I am not prepared to allow it to rest with a weak Ministry.

* The Channel Squadron would act as it has done in the past, and if it were not within easily communicable distance of the **British** Admiralty, would go to the assistance of another fleet if its services were required.

* If the Admirals of the **British** fleet were not prepared - as they have been in the past - to assume responsibility when occasion demands it, it would be a poor look out for the naval supremacy of Great Britain in the future.

* What should we think of a **British** Admiral in charge of the fleet who, being convinced that in the interests of Australia and of Britain he should take his vessels to a certain point, neglected to do so?

* It was shown by the deputation that the **British** settlers in the New Hebrides are becoming discouraged, owing to their inability to ob-; tain satisfactory tenure for their land, owing to the power and pressure which is exercised to their detriment by the French authorities.

* Dr. Macdonald,,  who has spent a number of years in- the islands, has returned to Australia able to show the Prime Minister the difficulties under which the **British** residents there suffer from French aggression.

* And yet we and the **British** Government are allowing foreign nations to obtain possession: of the most desirable harbors almost at our doors.

* to show that Parliament^ or this House, at any rate, is determined to impress on the Imperial Government the imperative necessity of taking prompt steps to place the **British** position in the New Hebrides on a much sounder footing.

* In view of the cordial relations between France and Great Britain at the present time, there might surely be some definition of **British** rights in the islands.

* I understand that an amendment is now under consideration, which will put the motion in a much more specific form, and I trust that the motion as amended will go to the **British** authorities as an expression of opinion from this Parliament as to the urgency of the question, and as to the importance which is attached to it by the people of Australia.

* As an explorer he has gained considerable fame, and has done something, too, towards bringing the light into dark places, and pushing the great **British** Empire further and further into the uttermost recesses of the earth.

* He was a man of first-class reputation, and held, as I have indicated, a very prominent place in the **British** Parliament.

* **British** armaments have been thrown like a cloak round the coast of Europe, and access to the high seas has been denied to any possible enemy that might threaten Australia.

* The **British** problem is our problem.

* Mr. Haldane  said - 
It was laid down with extreme clearness by the right honorable gentleman, the member for th'e City of London, on nth May last, in a speech to which we all listened wilh the deepest interest, because we felt it marked a new stage on the way to efficiency, that on the hypothesis of the worst possible moment of our military position, and on the calculation of Lord Roberts, accepted by other military critics, it would not be possible to attempt an invasion of our island with less than 70,000 men, and no admiral of the **British** Fleet would undertake such a task.

* During the period 1891 to 1903 (thirteen years) there was an excess of exports over imports of 89,267,000, while the tribute paid by Australian Governments to creditors outside the Commonwealth in the same period was certainly not less than one hundred and seventy-seven millions - so that the indebtedness of Australia to **British** and foreign creditors was apparently increased during the period by about eighty millions, allowing for some seven millions sterling, imported by immigrants.

* In 1904 their external trade was valued at ,94,500,000, the highest upon record ; and' I am proud to say that 74 per cent, of That trade was done with the **British** people.

* They had a gold production equal to that of the whole of **British** South Africa, including Cape Colony, the Transvaal, Orange River, Natal, Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Rhodesia, and four times as great as that of Canada.

* They had a wool production eight times as large as that of the whole of **British** South Africa, and forty times as great as that of Canada.

* Their live stock numbered four times as many as the live stock of the whole of **British** South Africa, and six times as many as were possessed by Canada.

* Their external trade was equal to that of Canada, and 11,000,000 greater than that of the whole of **British** South Africa.

* When, therefore, we hear Australia decried and misrepresented for political or other purposes we may turn our thoughts with pride and satisfaction to this record of what has been and is being done by a small number of **British** people, totalling only about 4,000,000.

* I move - 
In reply to the honorable member's questions, I beg to state that - (1) Communications  on  the subject are in progress with the CommanderinChief of the **British** army, Lord Roberts.

* Preference should undoubtedly be given in favour of **British** goods for these reasons.

* Australian politicians claim as the basic reason of protection against **British**-made goods that the highly paid Australian workman must be protected against the lower paid **British** workman.

* a logical conclusion by a preference or protection for the **British** steam-ship owners against the heavily-subsidized German steamers, and for the higher price of labour in the United Kingdom than in Germany.

* In New Zealand a preference of 20 per cent, is given in favour of **British** rails.

* The word " irreverent " is capable of a very wide interpretation, and if reformers in the past had been guided by the spirit which underlies the Chairman's ruling, there would have been no parliamentary institutions in any **British** colony to-day.

* On the other hand in the four years from1885 to 1889 the **British** exports of cotton goods to the States fell to 224,000,000 yards- a loss of 357,000,000 yards, or three-fifths of the whole.

* The **British** troops were depressed.

* If we out A over B or C over D the **British** Empire is immediately in danger.

* During the last twelve years or so we have had  anarrangement  with the Imperial authorities under which we have contributed towards the maintenance of an Australian Auxiliary Squadron to supplement the **British** Fleet in Australian waters.

* We are asked to increase our annual contribution, and henceforth it is to be devoted, not to the maintenance of an Australian  Auxilliary  Squadron,  but  wholly to the maintenance of the **British** Squadron.

* been recommended to us for several reasons, one being that we are not in a position at the present time to establish an efficient squadron of our own, and that it is highly desirable that we should arrange for some protection by contributing towards the maintenance of a **British** squadron upon our coasts.

* It has also been stated that it is not the amount of our contribution that appeals so strongly to the **British** naval authorities as the moral effect which the agreement would have by indicating the extent to which we are prepared to assist in maintaining the general interests of the Empire.

* Thanks to the great politicians who have controlled the destinies of these States in the past, the **British** authorities have gradually been induced to recognise the unwisdom of centralized control of that character, and have  bestowed  upon us the complete measure of self-government that we possess at the present time.

* The wisdom of that departure from old methods has been fully recognised by **British** politicians and by naval defence experts.

* The squadron was not part and parcel of the **British** fleet.

* Its presence did not imply a reduction of that section of the **British** fleet which was stationed in Australian seas.

* Under its provisions we are asked to dispense with that squadron, and to substitute a section of the **British** fleet, pure and simple.

* I am of opinion that neither the **British** Empire, nor the nations which may view it with feelings of enmity, require any such demonstration on our part.

* Our contribution to the success of **British** arms in South Africa cannot be questioned.

* It simply binds us to provide a certain sum of money annually, and to place it at the disposal of the **British** Admiralty authorities, who are at liberty to spend it as they think fit.

* The same remarkable growth of expenditure is to be found in connexion with the **British** Army.

* When this question was submitted to the Conference of Premiers in London, the Prime Minister of Australia, as well as the Premiers of New Zealand and Cape Colony, accepted the new Imperialistic views of the **British** Government, and decided to ask their respective Parliaments to agree to this contribution.

* The **British** people have proved their capacity for self-government, and their consideration for others.

* I do not believe that the **British** Government, or  Mr. Chamberlain,  who is now speaking for the **British** Government, want to apply for one moment to Australia that commercial spirit which underlies their dealings and relationships with other countries.

* The history of **British** commerce teaches this one fact above all others.

* Everyone knows that there is a growing tendency on the part of people in all **British** communities to doctor themselves by the use of tabloids and pilules, and other preparations of that kind.

* It is a fundamental principle of **British** law, which is supported by centuries of experience, that the onus is upon the party making a charge to prove the person guilty who is charged with a breach of the law.

* Whether it is a fact that Australian and **British** authorities discourage the interchange of newspapers through the medium of special postal rates?

* Whether it is a fact that Australian newspapers re-posted in England or **British** newspapers posted in Australia are.

* Whether these rates are the outcome of an understanding between the Australian and **British** Postal Departments?

* Whether the Government are aware that the **British** Postmaster-General has agreed to deliver in the United Kingdom without surcharge, newspapers posted in New Zealand at a postage rate of one penny (as against a surcharge of 2 1/2 d. upon Australian newspapers), irrespective * of weight ?

* Will the Postmaster-General make a proposal to the **British** authorities by which Australian newspapers may be delivered in the United Kingdom at the reduced rate and upon similar conditions to those extended to the Government of New Zealand?

* Canada's imports are valued at  54,000,000,  and her exports at  41,000,000,  while **British** South Africa's imports are valued at  32,000,000,  and her exports at  43,000,000.

* The result of the present system is that the moment a scheme is formulated, either by the Admiralty, by any **British** general, or even by our own- officers, Ministers set.

* against candles of **British** manufacture, and of 21/2d.

* The General Officer Commanding, in his last annual report, discussed this matter, and expressed the opinion that, although decentralization might serve for the **British** Army, because of the vastness of the Imperial interests making it impossible for one Commander-in-Chief to control it throughout its length and breadth, it is not applicable to Australia, because our forces are comparatively small.

* Our forces are small, and insignificant compared with the strength of the **British** Army and Navy; but until the Transcontinental Railway has been constructed our means of communication Wil be in some respects as incomplete and our " touch " as faulty as that between the extremes of the **British** Army.

* Certainly, in Australia, compared with the **British** Isles, our forces are scattered over an immeasurable space.

* Therefore, although the reasons for decentralization may not be the same in the two cases, they apply with regard to our forces as much as with regard to the **British** Army.

* It will be necessary when this Board of Administration is appointed - and I may say, in passing, that I hope to have the whole scheme in operation by the end of the year, which is not a very long time for the Committee to allow me- 
I think there are enough experts in the **British** Empire to see Australia through any difficulty without our seeking outside assistance.

* Is not Canada a part of the **British** Empire?

* Whether, in view of the trial at Staines, England, on the 11th of November last, in which the Hylard rifle - an Australian invention - proved, it is stated, infinitely superior to the Lee-Metf ord, the Government will request the **British** Government to test the merits of the Hylard rifle, and not complete the order for 20,000 rifles until after such investigation ?

* I should realize at once that the Government proposals would not allow **British** merchants to send an extra pound's worth of goods into the Commonwealth in competition with the Australian goods.

* Out of the800,000 worth of trade which it is urged will be affected by these proposals, we can only hope to divert about100,000 worth into **British** channels.

* While under the proposed **British** preferences we may hope to annually divert  100,000  worth of additional trade into **British** channels, under the New Zealand agreement we shall exclude trade with Great Britain to the extent of 150,000 annually.

* Under the **British** preference scheme, New Zealand is treated as a foreign nation.

* Then they imagine that **British** merchants lookingfor avenues of.

* In my judgment, this scheme will meet with very short shrift at the hands of the **British** people.

* I submit that there is only one way in which we can show our  bona fides  in the matter of trade with Great Britain, and that is by doing what has already been done by other **British** communities, such as Canada and South Africa.

* My infinitesimal proposal, which the Minister so contemptuously brushed aside, is equivalent to an all-round reduction of 2 per cent, upon **British** goods.

* Therefore I maintain that my proposal of an all-round reduction of 2 per cent, upon the duties levied upon **British** goods is even a more generous one.

* Instead of being described as one to provide for **British** preference, it ought to be named "A schedule providing for further Australian preference as against not only Great Britain, but the rest of the world."

* The Government had Australian, not **British**, preference in view when they framed it.

* If the Government seek further protection for Australian industries they should not attempt to gain it under cover of granting a preference to **British** imports.

* The white population of **British** New Guinea is so small that I think that even their interests, as well as those of the natives, would be much safer in  the hands of the Governor-General - and Governor-General, I presume, means " the Governor-General in Council "- 
Than they would be in the hands of a few nomadic settlers, who might go to **British** New Guinea as prospectors, intending to make it merely a temporary abode.

* In India, for example, native races under the Crown are not allowed to exercise the franchise as **British** subjects in other parts of the Empire, where there is responsible government, are able to do.

* **British** New Guinea is as yet in its infancy.

* I know of no Legislature within the **British** realm where there exists such a closure resolution as we have in operation in this Parliament.

* Consequently England is beginning to feel the importance of putting a stop to this practice, and during the present year the **British** Parliament has been engaged in considering a measure which is intended to have that effect.

* The only distinction between it and that of America is that we do not draw a line between aliens and **British** subjects, and our reason for not doing so is that there are undesirable **British** subjects, just as there are undesirable aliens, whereas the United States have no undesirable citizens, all its subjects subscribing to the same standard of living.

* I said a little while ago that a Court in New South Wales absolutely refused to give effect to one of these monstrous provisions, which are contrary to even the rudimentary ideas of **British** justice.

* This was an outrage against all ideas of **British** justice.

* There never yet was in the **British** Empire a Parliament that was not prepared to intelligently discuss and criticise all measures submitted to it affecting the inter- ests of the great  mass  of the people.

* So far as the interests of Great Britain are concerned, we may safely leave to the Parliament of that country the adoption of measures necessary to prevent our producers from inflicting injury on the **British** people.

* Surely we can leave all such precautions to the **British** people themselves.

* Is it true, as reported, that the Government have ceased to collect duties under the **British** preference schedule, and are returning the money already collected?

* When the original Act was introduced, I protested against the interference of the **British** Government, and  T  object, still more to our being called upon to concede rights to Oriental nations inrespect of our internal legislation.

* -He might also have had in mind the experience of the people of **British** Columbia.

* Surely persons of races whose members have fought side by side with our own soldiers in the defence of the Empire, and for the extension of **British** trade and commerce into the Shan "States, Baloochistan, Burmah, and Further India, should be given the same consideration as the people of Japan !

* The indentured labour to which I referred would not be' kanakas, but **British** subjects who were natives of India.

* It was reported from Canada the other day that the Government of the Dominion have refused to ratify an Act of **British** Columbia on this subject, because it does npt wish to hamper the Imperial authorities in regard to the Far Eastern question.

* That was really the strong argument put forward, but it seems to me to be outrageous that our fellow **British** subjects should be shut out if honest contracts are entered into when men are required.

* Whether he has noticed that one of ils clauses applies the benefit of **British** validation of the Australian marriages referred to in the Bill only to cases where both of the parties were domiciled in the State in which the marriage took place?

* The Attorney-General went to America for all his illustrations, and I think it would have been better if he had selected some from **British** communities.

* Neither will the great body of **British** unionists.

* The first is the supremacy of the Constitution - a principle which may exist elsewhere, but which in Constitutions more upon the **British** form depends upon the enactments or declarations of a sovereign Legislature, whilst in written Constitutions, especially of a Federal character, it is necessary that every piece of legislation should be within the limits which the people have set for themselves in the Constitution which they have adopted.

* We may take it that practically the decision carried into statutory effect by the **British** Parliament gave all else that we demanded, and it was a great and magnificent indorsement of the demand made by the people of this country for their own Constitution.

* As the result of long negotiations, and as I am frankly bound to admit to this House, only as the price that had to be paid to prevent more drastic amendments of the Constitution, the amendment which I have described was adopted and carried into effect by the **British** Parliament with the proviso that an appeal might go even from the High Court to the Privy Council onaquestion involvingan interpretation of the Constitution if the High Court certified that that question was one that ought to be determined by the King in Council.

* No such agreement has been arrived at between the **British** and Commonwealth Governments.

* You may safely and positively say that in no sense whatever is any differentiation made between the **British** and foreign labourer in connexion with mining in this State, the hours of work, rates of wages, and other conditions of employment being identically the same in every respect.

* I have also a comparison of the earnings of thirty-four men of three different nationalities, which shows that the Austrians earn more than the Italians, and the Italians more than the **British**.

* They are all **British**.

* In his dissertation upon naval defence, the Prime Minister affirmed that these destroyers would, if desired, act as the eyes of the **British** Fleet stationed in Australian waters.

* Yet that argument would have just as much force as1 those which have been used against the adoption of the prohibitive principle in **British** New Guinea.

* The present incredibly large importation of intoxicants into Papua shows the need for our intervention at this early stage of founding a new **British** Colony.

* <para class="block" pgwide="yes">
 Papua (**British** [23 November, 1904.]

* Their testimony shows that it would not be safe for white persons to settle in **British** New Guinea without having at their command in the shape of alcohol, an antidote for typhoid and malaria generally.

* Privilege  mentioned  us enjoyed in Great Britain is that companies pay **British** Post Office 5 yearly per mile for each wire, and work both ends by their own operators, collecting and delivering traffic direct with the public.

* He also thinks you should insist on South Africa to Australia cable being made all **British**.

* We have there an equally specific and detailed answer by  Mr. Chamberlain  on behalf of the **British** Government, which not only approved of the arrangement suggested by the New South Wales Government, but suggested farther modifications that were believed to be to the advantage of all the interested parties.

* Had those conditions not been inserted, the **British** Government would have called for tenders for the whole service.

* With regard to the exclusive employment of white labour, His Majesty's Government could not agree to introduce into a mail contract to which they were a party, stipulations intended to exclude certain classes of **British** subjects from employment in the contract vessels, and unless that condition could be modified, the idea of a joint arrangement would have to be abandoned, and other plans made for an Australian service.

* the **British** authorities who are in closer contact with the head offices of the company have expressed the opinion that they would have been able to secure the extension of the service at the same rate.

* What becomes, therefore, of the suggestion put forward by the- leader of the Opposition, who, after all, was merely repeating statements which have been hurled forth from one end of Australia to the other, that this lack of confidence on the part of the **British** investor is due to the attitude of the Labour Party in Australia?

* **British** people, so long as they are under the **British** flag, feel that they are still at home.

* It is sufficient to show that the aim of the Transvaal has been to subvert the Imperial authority and expel the Imperial power, and that the sympathetic attitude of the Afrikander Bond, however human it may be, has been used to draw **British** subjects into a dangerous course, and has led them to coquet with an ambition which the **British** half of the population and the **British** Empire will resist at all costs.

* Fitzpatrick quotes two authorities to prove that for half a century past there has been an almost acknowledged design on the part of the official burghers in the Transvaal to upset **British** supremacy in South Africa.

* In 1891there was an expenditure of 14,000,000 on the **British** navy, while the expenditure last year was 32,000,000.

* How much did the **British** possessions - India, all the colonies, the Dominion of Canada, and the Commonwealth of Australia - contribute towards that 32,000,000 ?

* According to the Board of Trade returns the contribution of the **British** possessions was not 550,000 ; and as a matter of fact our direct contribution is not 150,000 a year.

* In other words the contribution of the whole of the **British** possessions, including Australia, is not a sixtieth of the total naval expenditure.

* In the export and import trade of Great Britain, the share of the colonies and possessions is about one-fourth ; but, besides, there is a trade of about 300,000,000 between **British** possessions that never touches the United Kingdom, but which enjoys the protection of the **British** flag.

* They are words which are quoted by a leading German journalist as one of the chief causes of the irritation of Germany towards England - 
I regret to say that this doctrine, supported as it is by a ceaseless stream of malignant lies about the intentions of the **British** Government - which were supported from the same quarters as the stop-the-war policy is supported from now - is producing a great effect.

* It was producing a feeling there antagonistic to the maintenance of **British** rule within **British** possessions, and not merely within the Transvaal or the Orange River Colony.

* Language is frequently used which seems to imply that the Dutch have some superior right, even in this colony, to their fellow-citizens of **British** birth.

* Thousands of men peaceably disposed, and, if left alone, perfectly satisfied with their position as **British** subjects, are being drawn into disaffection, and there is a corresponding exasperation on the side of the **British**.

* Is he aware of any pledge given by the **British** Government, by treaty, or proclamation, or otherwise, to the effect that natives of India are to be admitted to all parts of the **British** Empire?- 
It is undeniable that a great deal is to be said for the view taken by the Minister for Home Affairs, that some sort of preliminary limitation is desirable, the only matter in dispute being what character this preliminary limitation is to take.

* I understand that in the **British** civil service there is no preliminary limitation other than that the Candidate shall be medically sound and shall present a personal character of fitness, respectability, and so on.

* Since the newspapers and the Prime Minister have referred in eloquent terms to the Peace Armada of the world, it may not be a vain speculation for me to suggest that when we find America, through the mouth of this great admiral, going out of its way to compliment 'Great Britain, and practically the **British** Empire - a most unusual thing to do - it is a sign of a good feeling existing between the governing force in the United States and the governing force in Great Britain to-day.

* That is all I wish to say in that regard, only regretting that the **British** authorities did not, as I suggested on several occasions last session, see that Great Britain was properly represented in our waters during the visit of the American Fleet.

* One of the best ways of securing adequate naval defence ig to pay a large subsidy to the Imperial authorities to increase the strength of the **British** squadron in our waters.

* He mentions the plantations made  by three **British** noblemen - the Duke of Athol, who at Dunkelt planted 28,000,000 trees' on 16,000 acres; the Earl of Seafield, who, at Inverness, planted 60,000,000 trees on 40,000 acres; and Lord Powerscourt, who, at Wicklow, planted 3,000,000 trees on 1,000 acres.

* Even although in Australia the average drinker takes only two-thirds of the **British** amount of liquor, one man out of thirty who consumes alcohol regularly is bound to be taken to the lock-up in the course of a year on a charge of drunkenness.

* I therefore beg earnestly that the **British** public will refrain from tempting my gallant comrades, but will rather aid them to uphold the splendid reputation they have won for the Imperial Army.

* The honorable member for Parramatta has stated that the provision, in its original form, would have the effect  of benefiting the foreigner instead of **British** sailors.

* When we endeavoured to make provision that ships carrying goods entitled to preference should be manned by white **British** seamen, neither the honorable member for Parramatta, nor any of his associates in the Opposition, helped us in any way.

* It appears to me that if the Prime Minister's proposal be agreed to, the whole of the advantage conferred by the agreement will be derived by **British** manufacturers, and that **British** ship-owners and white **British** seamen will not receive any consideration.

* Suppose that at the time of the opium war in China, when the whole power of the **British** Empire was used to force opium on China, there had been a collection of military stores at Perth or Port Darwin, and the Chinese had attacked those stores ; should we have been justified in compelling a man who did not believe in that war to shoot those who were making the attack  f 
It was written in February, 1904.

* We may have bonds which are more desirable in other respects, and in return for them we may secure a reduced rate of interest, in the same way as **British** consols by virtue of the position of **British** credit bear only  i  per cent, interest, whereas a South American Republic can borrow money only by paying  8  per cent, or 10 per cent.

* He simply makes use of the fact that he can get **British** stock and **British** consols at a moment's notice, as long as he has the money.

* We were made much of because we were supposed to represent, in a higher degree than any of those other **British** commissions or delegations which have been seen in Germany, the people of Britain as a whole.

* No responsible person with whom I spoke doubted the supremacy of the **British** Navy, nor is it doubted" that its absolute supremacy is essential.

* Later on, we shall probably find that the **British** Admiralty has advised us to spend our money, as the Fisher Government proposed to do, in providing for our local defence by .building up a navy here to co-operate with the **British** Navy.

* The late Government did their work as any **British** Government would.

* We should be told who is to superintend the building of the vessels if they are to be built here, and who is to command and man them ; whether we shall depend upon our own officers or obtain officers from the **British** .Navy to assist us in this great work.

* We pay considerably less than one-half the cost of the ships in these waters, and we have the whole **British** Navy at our back, whilst the ships of the Australian squadron have to be kept up-to-date.

* If we want any submersibles or torpedo boats for Hobson's Bay, Sydney Harbor, Fremantle, or elsewhere, let us get them, but do not let us touch the Agreement, which has still years to run, and which gives us a small share in the **British** Navy.

* Certainly a one hundred and fiftieth part is a small share, but to that extent we are co-partners with the Admiralty in the **British** Navy, and of that I think we might well be proud.

* In Great Britain a special committee was recently appointed on the motion of the Secretary of State for War, to inquire into the nature of the expenses incurred by the officers of the **British** Army, and to suggest measures for bringing commissions within the reach of men of moderate means.

* I left England at the close of 1903, for the purpose of collecting information for the **British** Cotton-Growing Association, as to whether cotton could be successfully cultivated in Queensland under present conditions.

* I have traversed the whole of Queensland and the Northern Territory of South Australia, and visited  many  of the islands in the Fiji group, and the results of my investigations have been embodied in reports to the **British** Cotton-Growing Association, and to the Federal and State Governments of Australia.

* An officer of the Department of Agriculture accompanied me', -and we both traversed the State, interviewing farmers, examining soils, &amp;c, and the results of our investigations were embodied in a report which the Government forwarded to the **British** CottonGrowing Association of Manchester.

* is a truism in all **British** communitiesthat no law can exist which is not approved by a majority of the electors.

* In regard to illicit distilling operations and illicit coining, there must be a departure from the ordinary rules associated with **British** justice.

* I have already stated that there are instances in which the public welfare would suffer if the ordinary rules of **British** justice were followed.

* Personally, I think that we ought to encourage a settled population in **British** New Guinea as opposed to a mining population.

* It has to be recognised that the system of controlling the **British** Army by means of a board, is no new experiment.

* Mr. Fortescue  goes on- to say - 
I should like to remind the Minister, who is showing a disposition to slavishly adhere to the methods of the Imperial Forces, that the **British** authorities were not above permitting a German to take charge of one of their most important Departments.

* He was not a **British** subject at the time he came over to England.

* Most of the Master Printers' Associations of Australia had no objection to **British** and foreign manufacturers' price lists and catalogues being admitted free of duty so long as the same privilege was not accorded to Australian manufacturers attempting to get their work done abroad.

* That is the evil j printing done abroad for Australian houses is brought here to compete with local printers, but the local printers do not object to **British** and foreign merchants being allowed to print their own price lists and catalogues, and bring them in for commercial purposes.

* Because with every financial proposal that he laid before **British** investors he had a sinking fund.

* The difference that is involved is this: That unless some such principle be affirmed in connexion with the working of this Court, this latest achievement of democracy will become a greater grinder of the poor than has existed within the **British** Empire for the last  joo  years.

* For the past half century or more it has been the practice in all the Legislatures of the **British** Empire to turn to the House of Commons for guidance in such cases.

* That in the opinion of this Council it is desirable (1) that foreign ships engaged in the coasting trade of Australia should be subject in all respects to the same laws, rules, and regulations to which **British** or Australasian ships so engaged are subject; and to that end (2) that the Federal Government should introduce into the Commonwealth Parliament a Bill to amend the Customs Act No.

* The New South Wales manufacturers suggested that the dutv on **British** products should be is.

* Whether he is aware that it has been the usual practice for **British** vessels of war when coaling at Thursday Island to employ longshore labour ?

* We have been assured that the introduction of Chinese into the Transvaal is an entirely new departure - in other words, that there are no Chinese in the **British** Empire.

* The number of Chinese scattered throughout the **British** Empire is now very large indeed, and .

* For aught that we know to the contrary, the labourers whom it is proposed to introduce into South Africa may be **British** subjects, who will be transported from Singapore or Hong Kong.

* If I were in the **British** Parliament I would admit that I cannot imagine how English statesmen could have fallen into such a serious error as has been made.

* If the Labour Partyhad objected to the introduction of Chinese on the ground that there should not be any form of slavery in the **British** dominions, their attitude would have seemed to be more in accordance with the idea of Empire ; but even if that were the position, it would be a matter for the people concerned and not for us to determine.

* It is because I would resent any interference, however well meant, on the part of the **British** Government, or the Government of any other part of the Empire, in regard to a matter of local con- cern, that I object to any interference by us.

* Then the honorable member would not object to the introduction of Chinese if they were **British** subjects ?

* We ignore the fact that there are so many Chinese throughout the **British** Empire, and that it may be **British** subjects of Chinese or Mongolian extraction who are wanted in the Transvaal.

* Therefore, I propose to ask honorable members to resolve - 
A day or two ago I was asked by the honorable member for South Sydney whether I was prepared to lay on the table the non-confidential portions of the correspondence which has passed between the **British** Government and the Commonwealth Government in relation to decimal coinage.

* We have had no indication so far of the intentions of the **British** Government in that regard.

* I have had extracted from the papers the non-confiden- tial portion of the correspondence; and will lay it upon the Library table this afternoon: 
Has the Australian flag, selected by competition last year, been submitted to the **British** Government, and with what result?

* We do not distinguish between **British** and foreign goods so far as general trade is concerned.

* For instance, the Minister, if he went into a shop to buy an article, would not take the trouble to find out whether it was of **British** or foreign make.

* If brought here in **British** bottoms, the duties charged will be at the rates hitherto in force; but it is proposed to differentiate between **British** goods conveyed in **British** bottoms and goods conveyed in foreign bottoms.

* I do not go so far as to ask that there shall be any exception which will allow **British** citizens to be engaged so as to interfere with industrial disputes in Australia, or to reduce wages and impair the conditions which prevail here.

* That being so, why should we say that, so long as there is a man disengaged in a. particular industry in Australia, he must be given employment before any of our **British** fellow-subjects are admitted?

* I do not know whether the Prime Minister would consider that the insertion of the words "citizens of the **British** Empire" would cover Asiatics.

* That at the end of sub-clause 2  the following  words be inserted :  - " Provided  that  paragraph  b  of this sub-clause  shall not apply  to **British** subjects."

* A great deal has been said about the decay of **British** commerce, and I 'was, therefore, surprised to read the figures relating to **British** trade on the Danube.

* Between 1857 and 1867, 450,000 tons of commerce entered the river, of which one-third was **British**; but in 1896 1,800,000 ions entered, of which three-fifths were **British**.

* If what I have described can be done by nations whose people speak different languages, and have often been at war, surely it is possible to reconcile and control the conflicting claims of three dependencies of the **British** Empire.

* I entertain the profound belief that the solvent principle of justice which has ever prevailed in **British** communities, will reduce our present difficulties to nought, and that no part of the Commonwealth shall suffer wrong.

* I agree that we should takeover the control of **British**, New Guinea,, but I trust that the main object of our administration of that Territory will be  tocontrol  it in the interests of the natives. ]

* Any attempt to impose disqualifications on the base of such distinctions, besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of **British** rule throughout the Empire.

* If honorable members consider that the test of writing 50 words in the English tongue will not exclude those whom we are determined to exclude, it is open to us to increase the educational test, with the hearty approbation of the **British** Government.

* Mr. Chamberlain  then repeats - 
In the second place, besides being contrary to the general policy on which the **British** Empire is based, the Bill is objectionable as embodying a provision which is peculiarly offensive to Japan, a power with which  His  Majesty's Government is, and earnestly desires to remain on friendly terms.

* Nearly every village may be said to be occupied by a separate tribe, and prior to **British** occupation of the Territory outbreaks used to occur, almost yearly between them.

* Sir, - An idea having, by some means, gained ground in Australia that the present Administration of **British** New Guinea is unsatisfactory, I have the honour to request that a Roval Commission may be appointed at an early date to visit this Territory, with a view to inquiring exhaustively into the matter.

* It was for that reason I thought it most desirable to endeavour to secure the services of  Sir William  McGregor - a man who could have trained up a body of young Australians according to the best traditions of the dealings of the **British**, Colonial Office with tropical countries.

* So long as the **British** Fleet remains within Australian waters, we shall not have much to fear, but if the necessities of warfare, or an enemy's ruse, drew it to some distance from our coast, we should be practically at the mercy of raiding cruisers, acting either independently, or detached from an enemy's fleet.

* But the head-quarters of the three **British** squadrons operating in the East is in the China seas and, consequently, the Australian Squadron may have to perform its duties at a great distance from Mie Commonwealth.

* We  have thetestimony of the **British** officers as to- the class of sailors who are now undergoing training in their ships.

* I am an out-and-out supporter of preferential trade within the **British** Empire.

* I am prepared to support a preferential trade, under which the duties on **British** goods shall be reduced 5 or 10 per cent., as the Tariff will allow, and a corresponding increase of 5 or 10 per cent, duty imposed on goods from other countries.

* But where would the revenue be if the duty were so high as to shut out all **British** and American goods, and force the people to obtain the whole of their machinery from Victoria ?

* That is a form of coercion which is absolutely opposed to the most cherished principles of **British** justice.

* The invitation was tendered through the **British** Government, and the reply will follow the same channel.

* No doubt a proper recognition of the visit of the fleet by the **British** squadron will be arranged bythe Imperial Government.

* The great body of opinion in Australia realizes that if we are to become a self-contained nation under the **British** flag we must remain federated.

* The woollen people there ridiculed the idea that, before capable and competent men, whose services were urgently needed for the establishment of an important industry on the banks of  the Yarra, could be brought out here to a **British** Possession, formal permission should have to be obtained to allow them, to land.

* The honorable member for Grey stated with truth that many **British** investors were sufferers through the bursting of the financial boom in Australia, and that thev felt very sore about what then took place.

* But we should not impose such restrictions as would render it impossible for reputable **British** immigrants to land here.

* It is a great pity that so much excited declamation has been wasted on the question whether or not the **British** Government will assent to any measure we may pass.

* So far as the present proposal is concerned, there is no reason whatever for saying that it will be disallowed by the **British** Government.

* And shall we also say that those employed must be white **British** subjects ?

* Does anybody know the trouble it takes to man ships all over the world, very much, no doubt, to the detriment of Great Britain - very much, no doubt, to the detriment of our mercantile marine, and very much, no doubt, to the detriment of our naval interests when the time comes for us to want able seamen  1  There is no doubt that there is a disinclination in the **British** islands to carry on a seafaring life, which disinclination did not exist years ago ; and ships cannot wait for months and months in port in order to make up crews, simply because they cannot get **British** subjects.

* What right have we to dictate, in any service which might be partly owned by America and partly owned by Australia, that none but Australian or **British** subjects should be employed on board such vessels  t  The thing is absolutely ridiculous.

* I myself think that all these ships ought to be manned by white men, and, if possible, **British** subjects.

* I do not want to make my speech an absolutely **British** speech, but I do say.

* we- all feel safer when a ship is manned, in its principal positions, by **British** men ; but to say that no ship subsidized for carrying mails through equatorial regions shall have one man in the stoke-hole who is not a white **British** subject, is, to my mind, carrying the idea of a " white Australia " far beyond its logical conclusion.

* I take it for granted that the honorable member for W est Sydney has gauged the opinion of honorable members, and 1 dare say he knows the temper of his fellow-countrymen as well as any man in this Chamber ; and when he says that there is an overwhelming majority in favour of restricting, if possible, the ordinary labour on board subsidized mail steamers to white men and to **British** subjects, surely no Government would dare to enter into a contract in which they did not, to the utmost of their ability, try to carry out the provision now proposed.

* I hold that the conditions under which men work in stoke-holes on the Red Sea, for instance, are not conditions compatible with the constitution and habits of **British** subjects.

* I am largely in sympathy with the feeling which actuates this proposal, and, as I said before, I never like to be on a ship where the majority of the sailors are not white **British** subjects.

* But entering on the legislation of this great Commonwealth, which must, whether connected with the **British** Empire or not, have large international relations, such a proposal seems to me absurd, and will, I think, cause great comment.

* The Prime Minister has unfurled an enormous flag, bearing on it the legend - "The mother country for ever, and preferential trade," while the Government Whip is walking after him, holding aloft a little piece of calico, on which is written - " Down with the **British** manufacturer.

* With reference to our imports from Great Britain, I should like to point out that it is remarkable that, in spite of the absence of a preferential trade arrangement, during the eleven years from 1894 to 1905 the **British** goods sold in.

* Talking about dumping, when I was recently in Queensland, I made this discovery : The complaint of the people there is not against the **British** or the foreign dumper, but against the Victorian dumper.

* The title of the Bill is " A Bill for an Act to amend the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) 1906."

* This is merely a proposal to amend a " schedule for **British** preference, 1906," whatever that may mean.

* A Bill for an Act to amend the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Act1906.

* This Act may be cited as the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) Act 1906.

* Clause 2' speaks of the " Schedule to the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) 1906."

* It is a consolation to find that battleships and first-class cruisers of other nations are carefully ticked off at the **British** Admiralty, their whereabouts carefully watched, and in time of war **British** ships of equal or greater strength would attend their movements.

* I hold that the conditions which have obtained in the various States are unworthy of the best traditions of **British** freedom.

* If the Empire were involved in war, the **British** war vessels would have to go where they could operate most effectively against the foe, and it behoves us to make preparations for defending our ports against privateers and raiding crews while they are absent.

* Hobson's Bay itself could probably shelter the greater part of our shipping, if the port were strongly enough defended to keep at bay, not perhaps a fleet of battleships, but such vessels as might be sent here to take advantage of the absence of the **British** Navy.

* However much we contribute, the **British** vessels will not remain on our coasts in time of war if it be necessary for them to go elsewhere.

* .- I could understand the appointment of a **British** general to advise upon a system of reorganization, but I discountenance the creation of offices in the Central Administration to give assistance to a Ministry in the making of a policy.

* It is proposed on Tuesday next to proceed with the Papua (**British** New Guinea) Bill, and to afterwards continue the consideration of the Estimates.

* We are going to be brought into closer connexion with the old country, and perhaps it may be our privilege to have, a voice in f;he external affairs of the **British** nation.

* We have in the past contributed a certain amount of money to the **British** Government towards the maintenance of certain war vessels on "the Australian station, but I believe we shall, in a short time, have to increase that subsidy, and I hope that we shall then insist upon it that these vessels shall not be taken away from the Australian station.

* W e must, therefore, rely upon the .assistance of the **British** Government, and we should certainly take a hand in helping that Government to maintain its navy.

* We know that the **British** Government subsidizes merchant steamers in order that she may have the call upon them and equip them for service in time of war if she should think it necessary.

* If a few reverses had been sustained by the **British**, Australia would soon be cut.off from communication with the outside world.

* - This clause is a total topsy-turveydom of the old **British** axiom, that every man is deemed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty.

* It is a departure which should be carefully considered by every one who respects the **British** spirit of fair play upon which most, of our laws are framed, and I hope that the committee will hot agree to it.

* because this House confidently relies; upon the fairness and wisdom of the **British** people for the avoidance of unnecessary war, and for providing all necessary naval supplies, and relies also on the power of the **British** people to retain command of the seas ; 
because any Australian money can be spent to much better effect in providing for the defence of our ports and our coasts, and in enabling thereby the **British** Fleets to operate freely in other parts of the world."

* If the Government enter into a contract with the **British** Government--- 
We must, however, remember that Australia is a new country, and that the beauties which we admire in other lands are not  always  - indeed, are not often- due to purely natural features.

* I think I am correct in saying that there is not a mountain in the **British** Isles over 5,000 feet in height.

* He does not care how much we restrict foreign vessels, as long as we allow **British** oversea steam-ships to continue, as at present, to carry passengers between the different ports of the Commonwealth.

* .I  cannot see that any Court could possibly give awards allowing the present rates of wages on Australian coasting steamers to continue, if we allowed foreign and **British** vessels, carrying Lascar crews, to engage in our trade and pay any wage they pleased.

* If there is to be any distinction whatever, it should be, as the right honorable member for Swan has said, in favour, first of all, of Australian shipowners, and, secondly, of **British** shipowners.

* Foreigners evidently recognise this clearly, as also the oversea **British** ships, which frequently compete in the coastal trade with their smaller and lower paid crews and cheaper repairs.

* Your petitioners submit that there is no good reason why foreign or oversea vessels should be exempted from the operation of legislation to which Australian vessels are subjected in connexion with Australian trade, and that the present practice of some great nations, and **British** practice of many centuries, including half of the last, would justify differentiation against foreigners.

* Voss maintains that  President  Roosevelt is doing all he can to makethe project apply to the country at large, and that through the **British** Parliament .

* It is an article by  Sir John  Pope Hennessy, who was Governor of Hong Kong ; a man of very great diplomatic experience, and with great experience as a working Governor in different **British** possessions.

* The **British** people have forced themselves, by the opium war, on China ; they have forced themselves on India, and on other places where there are coloured people.

* Therefore it seems to be inconsistent for the **British** Foreign Office not to be able to say " You yellow people are free to come in where the white men are."

* When  Mr. Chamberlain  speaks of the traditions of **British** policy, there are no such traditions in the broad sense, and what he refers to are the traditions of the Foreign Office.

* When one asks - Where is the tradition of the **British** policy which makes no difference between the black and the white ?

* It is all humbug to say that **British** traditions are in favour of no distinction being made between black and white.

* Anglo- indians speak of the natives as black niggers, and treat them without the slightest respect ; and I deny that there has been any tradition in connexion with **British** policy that obliges us to treat black and white as on the same level, or that .

* The United States Government apply their Chinese restriction law not merely to 
Complaints loud and persistent were made by **British**, American, and German ship-owners in Hong Kong.

* There was a picture recently published in an American illustrated paper representing the **British** lion with his tail in a trap, and the Russian bear walking off with Manchuria, and I think that very fairly represented the position.

* I rose particularly because I felt to a large extent in sympathy with the honorable and learned member for Indi, and I wholly regret that so many of my honorable friends, who are as earnest in desiring a white Australia as myself, feel constrained by loyalty to the Government and other considerations - because the  Government  did not put pressure on us-- 
Business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, service or emplo3'ment by land or in **British** ships trading solely between places iu Australia.

* I think, therefore, that the clause would better express the views of the Government if it read" " or in **British** ships - the Queen's ships of war excepted - whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth."

* It would extend to all seamen employed in Australian ships, and under Australian agreements, including ships registered in Australia, and it would also apply - although this is not quite so certain - to all **British** ships coming within the definition of the Constitution, " whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth."

* There may be some not unreasonable doubt whether it even, applies to all ships of the latter class, because this ia a Bill which seeks; so far as they are concerned, to regulate wages, and to provide for industrial agreements, whereas all, or practically all, of the **British** seamen on- such ships work under industrial agreements entered into- in London, Liverpool, or other **British** ports.

* It is questionable whether the clause would, apply to such **British** ships, but, in view of the elear words of the Constitution, it does apply, in my opinion, and, therefore, I have here inserted the words.

* It would in all Australian ships, because they are registered within our jurisdiction, and I believe that it would also apply to **British** ships coming within the definition given in the Constitution.

* I hold, however, that we cannot exercise any authority over **British** ships not coming within that definition, or over foreign ships ; further, that we cannot extend the authority of the court to either class of ships under this Bill.

* In the language of a distinguished text writer,  Mr. Hall,  in his  Foreign Jurisdiction of the **British** Crown,  " it requires to be express."

* The first relates to instances in which it is exercised over **British** subjects, the next to cases in which it is exercised over **British** vessels, and the third to instances in which jurisdiction is exercised over foreigners, irrespective of the national character of the vessel in which they are, on the ground of protective necessity.

* Finally, I find in  Sir Henry  Jenkins'  **British** Rule and Jurisdiction Beyond the Seas,  page 131, d quotation from  Halleck  - a very high au- thority - who, in his  International Law,  says- 
None would bind our municipal courts except in the interpretation which would be given to this law.

* But what we have to consider is the position of seamen upon **British** ships, and of foreign seamen upon foreign ships, which do not come within the provision of the Constitution.

* The court has powers which, according to the language used, might be taken to mean that it could make an award affecting **British** or foreign sailors under **British** or foreign agreements.

* Consequently, I venture to hold that any court before which such an extension of this measure was considered, would interpret it to relate only to those to whom it clearly relates - our own seamen or **British** seamen.

* What other power has this Parliament in the matter of the wages paid and the conditions obtaining upon **British** or foreign ships trading in our waters ?

* In my view the power of the Commonwealth over that trade is absolute, and in result, though perhaps not in fact, we have power over **British** and all other ships engaged in our coastal trade, even when they are outside the three-mile limit.

* Our power therefore over the costal trade is absolute, because we can prescribe the conditions under which it shall be carried on by Australian,- **British**, or foreign ships.

* If we have no jurisdiction, even in regard to **British** ships, then these words will not give it to us.

* I think that nothing but a Navigation Bill could put into this measure the power which would enable us to deal with all **British** and foreign ships.

* The Bill has been drawn from, first to last, looking upon the employer and employ^ with strictly equal eyes, with a view to bringing them before the Bar of a tribunal where in consonance with the principles dear to all **British** people, they shall have meted out to them even-handed justice - an even-handed justice whose fruits shall go home with them, affecting their lives, and those of their families, felt in all their surroundings, and opening up to them prospects of true profit and advancement.

* In **British** communities that is an unusual, procedure in connexion with such trials.

* My confidential advices lead me to the conclusion that unless the **British** creditors are satisfied that the Commonwealth has priority of security it cannot get much, if any, better terms than the States.

* It is a principle of **British** law that no criminal can be convicted without an inquiry being held into the charge against him, but apparently Queensland is not to be allowed the same rights and privileges as the greatest criminal in the land.

* As I say, Queensland has already been convicted, and now this Parliament is about to pronounce sentence, without extending **British** fair play and common justice.

* they replied, "the **British** Government will have something to say on that point."

* We are not to forget that the great empire of India is part of the
                **British** dominions, and that His Majesty the King is now going to set an example
                tending to the consolidation of the Empire by having a body guard of 200 Indian
                troops in the city of London itself.

* There is an unwritten law in the **British** Constitution that, if a gentleman has
                occupied the distinguished position of a Minister of the Crown, and has been in
                direct communication with the Sovereign, and declares, after his retirement from
                office, that he is not in a position to maintain his proper dignity without a
                certain amount being voted to him, that amount is cheerfully given.

* The
                Ministry say- 
As I have already said, I feel a deep sense of responsibility on this
            occasion, because I know that the eyes of all Australia, and probably of every portion
            of the **British** Empire, are fixed upon this Parliament and its legislation.

* As a Commonwealth, we have a common act and part with the **British** Empire; we must share in its prosperity, and in its adversity, more or less.

* I trust that when the honorable member for Barrier moves his amendment to submit this question to the people, asking them with the force of the Federal Parliament behind the suggestion, to erect a' monument in commemoration of the greatest and longest reign in the **British** Empire, honorable members will give him their support.

* Is every reigning head of the **British** Empire to have a monument, the cost of which is to be contributed to by the Commonwealth?

* Long before the Commonwealth was thought of the various States Governments had the matter brought under their attention, and at various periods made representations to the **British** authorities.

* As to making further representations to the **British** Government, I may say that the last Government and the present one have made representations, and, as honorable members are probably aware, there will shortly assemble, under the terms of an arrangement arrived at between the Governments of Great Britain and France, a Commission whose duty it will be to inquire into the rival claims with respect to land in the New Hebrides.

* I do not anticipate, of 'course, that the Commission will settle the question as to control, but at the same time it will probably help to get rid of some of the causes of difficulty which exist to-day between French and **British** settlers.

* A communication has gone from this Government to the **British** Government in respect to that Commission, and it is at least due to the Imperial authorities that we should not disclose its terms until they have had an opportunity of perusing it.

* As I have indicated, one important aspect of the matter is coming up for consideration, and we hope for settlement, within a very short time, under the arrangement entered into between the French and **British** Governments.

* From our standpoint it may be a wise thing to encourage **British** occupation of some of these outlying islands for strategic purposes, even where, from the purely financial stand-point, such a step might be inadvisable.

* I happen to know the overbearing manner of some of these **British** officers.

* A great many of the **British** Possessions have their own coinage.

* If the coins minted for us by the **British** Government had the same design as the English coins. "

* No doubt commercial intercourse would be a little closer if there were no distinct design for the Australian coinage, but it must be remembered that there is no standard value for silver coinage, and it is the practice of **British** communities to have each a  sepa-,  rate coinage.

* He states that he will see that no large areas in **British** New Guinea are alienated in the meantime.

* The Union Jack" is simply an emblem of **British** .spirit and pluck.

* So long as we are associated with the **British** Empire we' do not need to do more than look after the defence of our coast-line.

* I propose to make one or two small quotations from a work by  Sir F.  O. Adams, who was **British** Minister Plenipotentiary to Berne, as showing the difficulty of altering the Constitution - 
The Bill is a good one for that purpose, and I am not objecting to it, but I want **British** fair play to be meted out to people who have no guilty knowledge of these transactions.

* I know, as well as anybody, the desirability of keeping this fair land free from any large incursion of our fellow **British** subjects of India.

* It should surely be our desire, as members of the great **British** Empire, and not a separate and independent community, to avoid causing complications of the Empire.

* Let us obtain what we desire by a diplomatic course, which will effectually secure our object without arousing against us the enmities of the people of **British** India, Japan, and other countries, with whom it would be very serious for us to come into conflict.

* An agreement was made with these States to lay a cable from Australia to **British** Columbia - not a line owned by the Government all the way, as some would have us believe, because when it reaches **British** Columbia it connects with private lines through Canada, and thence with private cables from the eastern side of America to England.

* If there is any people in the world who are constantly subject to compulsion for the preservation of law and order, it is the people of the **British** race.

* I venture to say that the **British** financiers got no more out of that war than did financiers in any other part of the Empire, or the world.

* In other words, all but 70 of an absolute majority of the people of **British** New Guinea would have to sign a petition before there could be a poll.

* We are to consider the drinking habits of fewer than 500 people in **British** New Guinea.

* I must say that the people of **British** New Guinea lubricate their tonsils more often than a similar number of residents in any other portion, of the Commonwealth.

* This is the army to which the honorable member and others now propose to intrust the question whether there shall or shall not be' any liquor imported into **British** New Guinea, or whether its importation shall be checked.

* Therefore we wish to absolutely prohibit the sale of liquor in **British** New Guinea.

* I hope that it will not be repeated in the case of **British** New Guinea, but it appears to me that that result is likely to follow from the retrograde step which is.

* I do not know why it is that the missionaries of **British** New Guinea are found in opposition to legislation to further the good interests which they are promoting therein.

* Believing that we are at the critical moment of deciding the fate of half-a-million natives over whom we have control in **British** New Guinea, I feel the sense of a deep obligation resting upon me, so much so that while I am prepared to be reasonably guided by the missionaries, I do not consider that on this occasion I should subordinate 'my knowledge of what has happened elsewhere to their opinion.

* Guns and ammunition, sold by the Department as useless, have been sent  to  India, and used by the frontier tribes there against **British** troops.

* If the ammunition was good enough to be fired at **British**, soldiers, it was surely good enough to be used for practice purposes here.

* other part of the **British** Dominions.

* This was the **British** Empire, and he hoped it would always remain so.

* : - the necessity of not discriminating between various classes of **British** subjects; but, in reply, would respectfully point out that by some steam-ship companies the labour of the contributing Colonies is excluded from employment, and an invidious preference given to the labour of countries 'which do not contribute to the maintenance of the service.

* The right honorable gentleman is prepared to do what is calculated to undermine the future f the **British** Empire.

* The honorable members for Robertson and Wentworth greet that suggestion with a laugh, but it should not be forgotten that the **British** seaman is now very largely in a minority in the carrying trade of.

* When the time of stress and trial arrives, as it may before long, we shall require every seaman manning **British** ships to defend the Empire, and we shall find that the aliens, who are now employed merely for the purpose of bringing profits to the ship-owners, and who have taken the place of the **British** seamen, cannot be relied upon to defend our vast Imperial commerce.

* The honorable and learned member for Ballara: is also aware that they are **British** subjects, but he would not counsel their employment in a way which might be fraught with danger to the Empire.

* At the battle of Lundy's Lane, the American cow-boy volunteers broke the line of veteran **British** red-coats.

* Then we may safely leave their punishment to the **British** Parliament.

* No expedition, whether despatched from an enemy's base in the Eastern Seas or from Europe, could hope to reach its destination until the **British** Navy had been definitely worsted.

* So far, it is perfectly clear that this officer, although a military man, and a linesman, too, believes that our main line of- defence is the **British** Navy.

* Even without the **British** Fleet, as things are, he says that it would be impossible to transport troops over that huge distance.

* I am told by experts that, looked at from a common-sense point of view, even apart from the **British** Fleet, the idea that 
I do think that that is a fundamental mistake.

* It is utterly absurd for us to think of looking after our own interests or **British** interests in other parts of the world.

* Certainly, but we cannot do everything ; and we shall render best service "to the Empire by looking after our own coastline, and by saving the **British** Fleet from the necessity of having to detail vessels for the defence of Australian shores.

* If that can happen in time of peace, what will happen in time of war, when, under the agreement, the ships can be withdrawn to any part of the world that the **British** authorities may require?

* I know that those who have been investigating the condition of the **British** Army and Navy have been trying in the Army to copy the Navy, as far as they can.

* The officers in the **British** Army are being ruined by social functions.

* The Navy has -what is practically a Board of Control, and the same system is being introduced in the **British** Army, by the creation of a Council of War.

* We are really asked to interfere, so far as that great 
State is concerned, with 930 men, of whom nearly one-half are not of **British** nationality.

* The effect of the Bill as it left this Chamber, was to qualify, for pensions only such Asiatics as might be **British** subjects.

* A person resident in the Commonwealth, not being a **British** subject, and not being an aboriginal native of Asia, Africa, or the Islands of the Pacific, excepting New Zealand, who intends to settle in the Commonwealth .

* Consequently, the effect of the amendment would be confined to **British** born subjects who happen to be Asiatics.

* We shall never be able to make an agreement with anv other **British** community by which we shall gain more and lose less than under this agreement with South Africa.

* In my opinion, the Empire can provide for the wants of its own people, and I am prepared to give reasonable concessions to bring about the greatest idea of modern **British** statesmanship - an Imperial Zollverein.

* Until certain orders are made by the Privy Council, and certain documents executed, the administration of **British** New Guinea cannot pass to the Commonwealth.

* A point is made of the fact that the imported stained glass used in **British** churches is in part the product of Sunday labour.

* Mr. Rider  Haggard, some little time ago, was commissioned by the **British** Government to inquire into the settlement of immigrants in Canada and the United States, and I propose to read one or two salient passages from his report - 
The dual control is of course a very great trouble.

* I am very glad that the Government have provided, for this year at any rate, for the paymentof the Naval Subsidy of 200,000 to the **British** Government , for the protection afforded us by the **British** Fleet and the facilities offered for training our men.

* Meanwhile, if we can get the **British** Navy to do it for us at the small cost of ,200,000 a year, we ought to look at the arrangement a great many times before we cancel it.

* With regard to the launching of the  Belle- rophon,  a fine new **British** man-of-war,  Punch  states that the Australians have this time excelled themselves in generosity by sending a. bottle of Australian wine to smash on the bows of the ship.

* For the reasons I have stated I am pleased that the agreement with the **British** Government is not to be hastily cancelled.

* Whatever the fiscal policy of Australia may be, and much as I dislike the policy of protection, I venture to say that the **British** people will make progress under any policy, although the freer the policy is the less artificial it is, the more it is in harmony with natural conditions, and the more we allow the people to follow the bent of their own inclinations and energies, the more likely we are to develop the spirit of self-reliance that has been the chief characteristic of the **British** people throughout their history.

* The greatest of all free-traders that we have had in Australia, and the father of this federal movement- the late  Sir Henry  Parkes - although decorated with the colours of the Cobden club, held that we were perfectly justified in maintaining the **British** character of the population of these States.

* I say that whether the honorable member likes to throw it across this Chamber as a taunt to free-traders or not, he will find that we are for upholding the **British** character of the population, and for preventing the influx of those races which would contaminate it.

* I would draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that Hall, in summing up the case, carefully leaves out as the modern settled practice, the right claimed under the English Customs Act, of searching foreign vessels of war in **British** waters.

* In at least one case the **British** Admiralty has paid damages awarded by a foreign court against the captain of a ship of war, in respect of a collision between his vessel and  a  merchant vessel in the port.

* However proper it may be to put such a provision into the **British** Customs Act - the Imperial Parliament being the sovereign 
I have listened with a good deal of attention to the debate which has taken place upon this measure.

* I am an Australian first, and I look upon my connexion with the **British** nation purely as a secondary consideration.

* I certainly hold that the people of the Commonwealth, as the descendants of **British** stock, are just as capable of defending themselves as were their forefathers, and, given the same opportunity, would give just as good an account of themselves.

* I presume that his parents were **British**, as mine were.

* The honorable member urged that rum, whisky, and brandy were necessary in connexion with the opening up of a country such as **British** New Guinea.

* When we have prospected Australia to a greater extent ; when we have peopled the remote parts of the Commonwealth and turned our abundance of fertile soil to good use, it will be quite soon enough to prospect **British** New Guinea - to take the lands from the natives, and to give the pioneers some kind of stimulant whilst they are working in a malarial climate.

* I should support its use for all ordinary purposes, even in a climate such as that of **British** New Guinea, as against stimulants.

* If we set up an establishment in **British** New Guinea to sell intoxicating liquor under State control, who would see that itwas sold to the native population by only Government officials ?

* I do not suppose that the application of such a system to **British** New Guinea would have that effect.

* He then goes on to show that in 1901 goods to the value of 33,447,056 dollars were obtained by Canada from the **British** Empire, whilst her imports from foreign countries were of the value of 72,522.700 dollars.

* In 1904, her importations from the **British** Empire were of' the value of 51,614,555 dollars, and those from other countries were valued at 97,295,021 dollars.

* For one or two reasons, the volume of additional imports pf **British** goods will be very small.

* The total imports of sixteen of these items amount, so far as I can ascertain, to an annual value 'of 2,250,000, and only about 750,000 worth of these goods come from foreign countries and **British** possessions.

* He points out that the total volume of trade affected by the schedule amounts to 2,291,439, of which  i,473&gt;189  comes from the United Kingdom, 20,531 from Canada, 6,274 from India,- and 838 from other **British** Possessions.

* Deducting the trade of the United Kingdom and other **British** Possessions from the total,  a  balance of  790,603  is left, of which 432,533 comes from the United States.

* The proposals of the Government affect the wrong items to facilitate **British** trade to any great extent, articles being selected in regard to which she has already practically a monopoly.

* The Prime Minister laid great emphasis on the statement that it is to be stipulated that .goods upon which a preference is granted must be brought here in **British** bottoms; but let us examine that concession.

* Last year the total number of vessels bringing goods direct from the United Kingdom to Australia was 300, of which 289 were **British**, and n foreign.

* At the conference of Premiers in London it was proposed that a rebate of 10 per cent, should be made on **British** merchandise, but I proposed increasing the Tariff on goods from foreign nations.

* I hope that the Committee will stand by the Government and adhere to its previous decision, so that all Asiatics who have become **British** subjects and are qualified by residence shall be placed on exactly the same footing as other citizens.

* If one may judge from the despatches which are placed in our hands, it is abundantly evident that the Imperial Government do not any longer intend to continue financial assistance to that portion of New Guinea which is **British**, but that they expect, as is most clearly indicated in the despatches from the Home Secretary's office, the Commonwealth to take up this dependency and assume all financial responsibility.

* 23, of the 8th June, 1898, **British** New Guinea was annexed only in response to the unanimous demands of Australia - 
That, I repeat, is a very significant statement.

* It drives me to the conclusion that the **British** Government look to the Australian Commonwealth to assume financial responsibility and control, which, from the very initiation, the Imperial Government hoped would be assumed, if not by the Commonwealth, which was not then in existence, at any rate by the colonies of Australia.

* The statement is as follows : - 
These two statements taken together are sufficient to indicate to those who read them carefully that the Imperial authorities have come to the conclusion that we in Australia should take in hand the control, government, and management of **British** New Guinea.

* Sir William  McGregor has pointed out time and again that except by means of money expended by the Government - such as the Government is in New Guinea - there has been practically no development of any kind in the **British** possession, and that with the limited means at his command, and owing to the fact that he has not been able to obtain the services of many men of superior capacity, the exploration and initial work which he thinks necessary,  has not been a* satisfactory as could have been desired.

* Yet as we know - the Prime Minister has been careful to affirm and reaffirm the point - the area of **British** territory in New Guinea is some 90,000 square miles, or larger than the area of Great Britain.

* Sir William  Macgregor was careful to point out in a lecture delivered by him at the **British** Colonial Institute in 1899 that the German people were spending a great deal of money in developing their territory, and that as much as possible the Imperial authorities should 'do likewise if they were to gain any benefit from dealing with that possession.

* the Government in the future, if they take over **British** New Guinea, to make grants to prospectors with regard to mining, exploration, and matters of that kind ; but, if that island is to be successfully developed, some such methods will have to be pursued.

* I was struck also, in reading some literature on the subject, by a remark made by  Mr. Hatton  Richards, a gentleman who has had some considerable experience as a resident of New Guinea, and who affirms positively that one of the best things that the **British** Government could do would be to establish schools for the teaching of the English language to the children of the natives.

* He regarded this as one of the best means of civilizing some 300,000 odd **British** subjects, who are the natural inhabitants of that portion of the earth's surface.

* Then there is a very large and important question concerning the lands administration of **British** New Guinea.

* I observe, from a very interesting address, delivered by a member of the Royal Geographical Society, before the **British** Colonial Institute, that he very strongly expressed the opinion that the Pacific cable should be connected with New Guinea and with the Solomon and Gilbert groups of islands.

* if **British** New Guinea is to be controlled at all by the Commonwealth, it will be controlled as a territory; that it will be entirely in the hands of the Commonwealth to say what kind of Government it shall have, and to what extent that Government may go ; and that, with respect to its laws, they will be practically at the dictation of the Commonwealth, more especially with regard to the Customs taxation, which need not necessarily be uniform with the Commonwealth Customs taxation.

* All these matters apart, however - and also setting aside the apparent undue haste which is manifested in connexion with the subject - the question which naturally arises is : Can Australia, in view of Great Britain's determination not to contribute any longer to the financial necessities of **British** New Guinea, or her resolve, it may be, to abandon it, afford to let the island go ; or must Australia take in hand the work of governing the territory?

* of New Guinea is now **British** territory.

* The hoisting of the **British** flag on the island, by  Mr. Chester,  at the instance of the Queensland Government, was a patriotic act which now receives praise, and in the future will receive even heartier commendation from all those who claim to be true Australians.

* I regret with others that the whole of the island was not taken over by the **British**, and that a portion of it is now in the hands of a foreign power.

* The coast of **British** New Guinea appears to abound in harbours which might very easily shelter the warships of a foreign power, or be made the base for naval operations against the .

* On the occasion of the lecture delivered by  Sir William'  Macgregor before the **British** Colonial Institute - to which I have referred already - several gentlemen addressed themselves to the subject at the conclusion of his speech.

* His  speech was to the effect that in all the circumstances it would be extremely inadvisable to allow any portion of **British** New Guinea to be abandoned.

* There can be no doubt whatever that while, perhaps, for a considerable number of years the efficient control of **British** New Guinea will involve us in a large expenditure, the time must come inevitably when the island will be one of the best markets of the Commonwealth - when, together with the other adjacent islands, it will be peopled by persons of our own race and colour who will be large consumers of Australian products.

* These considerations lead me to say that although I would have preferred that this motion should have been delayed until we had had more information upon the subject - although, I think, it would have been better for Great Britain herself to have retained control over the islands for some years to come, and to have contributed to their management and government, and loath as I am to vote thus early for increasing the financial responsibility of the Commonwealth, yet I would be still more loath to allow **British** New Guinea to pass from the control of our Government.

* I have quoted already two extracts from the despatches in our hands, which lead me to the opinion that the Imperial Government will contribute no longer towards the expenses of controlling New Guinea, and that they have anticipated from the very beginning that **British** New Guinea would be controlled by the Australian States if not by the Commonwealth.

* The apparent hurry, therefore, is only the outcome of a stern necessity, and while I am very loath to saddle the Commonwealth thus early with the expenditure of perhaps many thousands of pounds, yet I am fully persuaded that it is better to face all the difficulties rather than lose **British** New Guinea to the Commonwealth.

* Does the **British** Government indorse the claim ?

* As long as the **British** Navy exists a force of from 40,000 to 50,000 will be ample to meet the most extreme emergency.

* It is admitted by all recognised authorities that as long as Great Britain has command of the seas the largest force that an enemy could land here would be 1,000 men, and that that force could be landed only with the assistance of, possibly, four cruisers that might manage to evade the vigilance of the scouts of the **British** Fleet.

* Even if we were to arm every man, woman and child in Australia we could not hope to resist a real invasion without the protection of the **British** Fleet.

* To imagine such a thing we have to presuppose the destruction of the whole **British** Fleet.

* During the last three years the proportion of **British** imports to the total imports has increased to 2,267 as compared with the total of 6,734 in 1905 from 2,839, as compared with 9,094 in 1903.

* I understood that the idea is to give a preference on **British** goods which we imagine need a preference.

* ItemIIIA, Wicker, bamboo, cane, or wood, all articles n.e.i., made of, whether partly or wholly finished, including bellows, casks, shooks, sashes and frames, timber bent n.e.i., wood cut into shape and dressed or partly dressed for making boxes or doors, walking sticks and canes,  ad valorem  (**British**) ao per cent., (other) 30 per cent.

* After consultation with the **British** Government, and after negotiations with other powers, resolutions could be brought in, and all that we desire could be obtained without the friction which would certainly have eventuated from the adoption of the amendment of the honorable member for Bland.

* It is all  A'ery  well to say that Ave must rely on the **British** fleet.

* We have been relying on the **British** fleet, and so long as Britain rules the waves we have no reason to apprehend that Australia will be in danger of invasion.

* But, I ask honorable members, is that a wise feeling to allow to grow up - a feeling of  absolute dependency on the **British** fleet ?

* Ought Ave not, as a self-relying, self.governing people to take stock of our situation, and to recognise our own obligation not to be merely dependent on the **British** fleet of the present, but, to some extent, try to establish an Australian navy of our own ?

* I do not suggest for one moment a rival fleet to the **British** fleet.

* I do not suggest that we should start a navy that would be in antagonism or in conflict with the **British** fleet in times of action ; but 1 do say that we might make arrangements in the direction suggested by the committee of naval officers which assembled in Melbourne in August, 1899.

* I do not suggest anything, very extravagant or very expensive, but I say that, as an alternative to the present system of paying an annual subsidy towards the **British** Govern- ' ment in, return for our auxiliary squadron, v.*e might organize a scheme of naval reserves in each of the principal seaports of Australia, on the lines recommended in this report.

* These naval reserves would form centres at which the seafaring population of Australia could be recruited and drilled in naval manoeuvres and practice, and they would form a body of trained men, who could, in time, either be drafted off for service in **British** men-of-war or placed on the reserve list here.

* I think that some system of that sort would be far preferable to the payment of subsidies to the **British** Government.

* I was reading to-day an essay in the  Edinburgh Review  of January- last, in which the writer, in discussing the future of the **British** Empire, makes this statement, which seems to me to apply with equal force to our' relations with the States - 
That was a very doubtful case, in which there were as strong claims upon the German as upon the **British** side.

* The **British** flag was planted on the island by the Queensland Government, and was taken down by Great Britain, and again planted there at the request of the Australian Governments, and we cannot ignore our responsibility.

* That in the opinion of this House it is expedient that the Government should introduce a Bill providing for the control and administration of **British** New Guinea by the Commonwealth.

* will be sufficient to exclude candles of **British** origin, otherwise they would have imposed a higher duty.

* If the duty is not sufficiently high, why does not the Government propose to increase it, so as to prevent **British** candles coming into competition with candles of local manufacture?

* were not sufficiently high to exclude **British** candles, a protectionist Government would increase it.

* The probity of the business men of the **British** race has always been claimed to be greater than that of any other business men in the world.

* There was to my mind ample justification for sending our men to South Africa, because Australia is as largely concerned in the preservation and protection of **British** power in South Africa as is any portion of the Empire.

* As a matter of fact, the  **British** Pharmacopoeia  is so comprehensive, and contains medicaments suitable to the treatment of so many different cases, that the less we encourage the introduction of patent medicines the better.

* No position in the public service at all controlled by the local elective bodies will be given to pensioners or servants of the **British** Government.

* But so long as the **British** flag floated over Dublin Castle, they would never rest  satisfied  until they pulled it down, and in its place raised aloft the flag of Ireland.

* The **British** imports were valued at 132,522.

* They are therefore of great strategical importance, not only to Australia, but also to the whole of **British** interests.

* The Imperial Government committed a very grave error when it allowed New Caledonia to pass out of its hands, because it cannot be denied that that island was originally surveyed and charted by the **British**.

* The **British** first established a. trading station there, and **British** missionaries first attempted their Christianization.

* In regard to the question of land tenure, of which the honorable member for Coolgardie spoke last evening, I would point out that the basis of the settlement of all claims between the **British** and French nations must ultimately be effective occupation.

* There can be no effective **British** occupation of these islands, so long as we place obstacles in the way of **British** settlement - obstacles in the form of Tariff restrictions which have absolutely precluded any possibility of the trade of these islands coming to Australia, and which have played into the hands of the French, who are said to spend about 40,000 annually in subsidizing shipping and other interests for the purpose of assisting French settlers to colonize them.

* This shows us the necessity of not reiving too much on the foresight of **British** statesmen.

* The same remark applies to the French, but we must remember that the **British** remained in sole possession of the trade of the New Hebrides group for forty years before the French colonists put in an appearance.

* It is true that the population of the islands is, for the most part, a native one, but it is only of recent years, and largely through the instrumentality of a shipping firm, actuated, I honestly think, not so much by commercial as by patriotic motives, that **British** settlement has been encouraged there.

* The paramount importance of the Navy to the **British** Empire and to Australia may be taken to be freely admitted.

* If such a plan (one fleet for the Empire) can be brought about it would be necessary for the **British** Dominions beyond the Seas to be adequately represented at the Admiralty.

* The **British** drug packers are represented in' London by an association defensive and offensive; have a periodical devoted to their special interests, whose advertising pages are filled to overflowing with the most impudent of their nostrums, and they keep their own barrister, as " Warren's Blacking " kept the poet.

* I am told that in Great Britain there are six separate firms which compete keenly for the trade of the world, and that on the continent there are other firms which compete with the **British** manufacturers.

* whether his members considered that the foreign explosives used upon the Western Australian gold-fields were superior to **British** explosives.

* That, with a view to promoting and encouraging **British** and Australian settlement in Fapua and.

* the islands of the Pacific, a rebate of duty or its equivalent for a period of seven years from the date of taking up land for tropical cultivation be allowed to each  bon fide  settler on all **British** and Australian islandgrown produce coming into the Commonwealth.

* Although this question is one which I have brought under the notice of the House on previous occasions, I feel that no apology is necessary for again directing attention to it, in view of its supreme importance as affecting the future advancement and security of Australia, and of Australian trade with the **British** Empire and the rest of the world.

* Apart from the fact that these islands offer a tremendous field for commercial exploitation, withimmense potentialities of wealth to tempt speculators and settlers ; the necessity is urgent and imperative for establishing effective **British** occupation of them as a prelude to opening up negotiations for their absolute annexation by Great Britain at a later date.

* But what is more important still, they recognised that the possession of islands in the Pacific would give them an important advantage in the matter of establishing coaling stations and naval depots for fleets which might be necessary either for raiding **British** commerce or protecting their own in time of war.

* Up to a few years ago such an amount of apathy was exhibited by the Colonial Office as to well nigh cause despair to eat into the hearts of the various Colonial Governments which had from time to time represented to the **British** Government the importance of securing possession  of the principal islands in the Pacific.

* He subsequently made representations to the Colonial Office as to the importance of bringing the islands entirely under **British** control.

* This illustrates how little was the interest taken at the time by the **British** Colonial Office in any matter appertaining to Australia and the Pacific.

* I am pleased to note that of later years a slight change has come over the spirit which seemed then to prevail, but even now the **British** authorities do not appear to be anything like sufficiently alive to the interests of Australia, and of Great Britain, in the Pacific.

* The islands of that ocean are practically shared by the Americans, the Germans, the French, and the **British**.

* Some of the groups of islands at present entirely under **British** control have been brought under that control only as the result of continuous watchfulness and repeated representations on the part of Australian and New Zealand Governments to the **British** authorities.

* As the result of such representations **British** annexation has followed in the most tardy fashion after having been in most cases more than once refused.

* It is for this reason that I urge the consideration of a rebate of duties or some other equivalent to encourage **British** settlers.

* When I speak of the **British** settlers I have in mind more particularly Australians, because it will be largely from Australia, that these islands will be settled.

* Every additional **British** settler there constitutes a further safeguard to the security, not only of Australia and her commerce, but of the Empire.

* There is great ignorance in the Old Country regarding these matters, and I shall presently relate some startling facts that will open the eyes of honorable members to the dilatoriness and supineness of the **British** Government in respect to this question.

* I hope that in any scheme for advertising the resources of Australia the advantages which these islands offer for the investment of **British** and Australian capital will not be overlooked, and that we shall endeavour in that way to build up a Greater Britain in the southern seas.

* Any scheme which would have the effect of removing from the **British** settlers the disabilities under which they now suffer would have my support.

* The special attempt at **British** colonization to which I refer was defeated by the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff.

* **British** settlers can take advantage of these arrangements by transferring their allegiance to the French flag, but the offering of this inducement to our people to become French citizens is a menace to us.

* And the more such inducements are availed of the greater is the certainty of the ultimate extinction of **British** interests within the group and the passing of the Islands entirely under French control.

* **British** missionaries reached Tahiti.

* Queen Pomare asked for a **British** Protectorate.

* French missionaries reached Tahiti (40 years after **British** missionaries).

* The **British** Government declined to interfere.

* The Tahitians protested against French rule and declared a desire for **British** rule.

* Dupetit Thouars, however, deposed the Queen, and it is stated imprisoned the **British** Consul.

* First **British** settlers reached Fiji.

* **British** missionaries reached Fiji.

* King Thakambau asked for **British** annexation.

* Fiji again sought **British** annexation. "

* **British** missionaries reach.

* King Josiah asks for **British** Protectorate.

* King George renews request for **British** Protectorate.

* **British** Protectorate at last declared.

* **British** missionaries landed.

* Baron Maclay asked for establishment of **British** Protectorate of North-East Coast.

* **British** Missionaries landed - **British** Sandalwood traders years before.

* Presbyterian Missionaries petition for **British** annexation.

* **British** Government interposes objection.

* All white settlers **British**.

* Joint **British** and French Naval Commission appointed to protect white settlers.

* **British** and French residents appointed at Vila.

* The **British** settlers are complaining loudly ; and only recently a letter appeared in the London  Times,  and has been referred to in the newspapers of Australia.

* In the  A,gus  of yesterday there is the following cable: - 

 The Times this morning publishes a letter from its Sydney correspondent, which sets forth the grievances of **British** subjects in the New Hebrides.

* The writer alleges that  the **British** Resident has been holding aloof from the settlers and traders, and that his chief concern is to avoid doing anything that may hurt the feelings of his French colleague, M. Noufflard.

* It is said that he makes no endeavour to secure a modification of regulations which press with undue severity upon the **British**.

* What truth there may be in that statement I am unable to say ; but it is very evident that complaints have been made, and equally evident, on information which reaches me privately, that there is cause for widespread dissatisfaction amongst the **British** settlers.

* It is urged that France is leaving no stone unturnedto minimize **British** influence, and reduce **British** claims to practically nil, thus placing **British** settlers in such a position that, when the respective claims of the French and the **British** come before the tribunal to be appointed, the French will have a preponderating advantage by reason of their much stronger position, and their laudable keenness and determination to see that no point is neglected that will tell in their favour.

* In this connexion there recently appeared in the  Age,  the date of which I regret I omitted to note, the following : - 
Keen disappointment was expressed in Presbyterian circles yesterday at the announcement which appeared in  The Age  that the Federal Government had found it impossible to take action in regard to the land question in the New Hebrides, where the French authorities are actively engaged in preparing their claims for the Anglo-French Land Court, while little or nothing has been done to assist the **British** settlers in the group.

* Information has reached the Presbyterian Church authorities that over twenty French surveyors are at present surveying land in the islands, and that a large number of the **British** settlers has been served with notices that certain areas are claimed by the French.

* That is a most serious matter as affecting the interests of the **British** settlers.

* It seems that while we - and by " we " I mean both the **British** and the Federal Governments, though, perhaps, the latter, in a lesser degree - are largely sleeping on our rights, and permitting the French, as time goes on, to gradually acquire greater hold on these lands and to establish a much better claim to effective occupation than, under present conditions, is possible for **British**' settlers.

* The Presbyterian Church of Victoria,  with a view to conserving as much as possible the interests of the **British** and Australian missionaries and natives, has, as forecasted in  The Age,  been compelled in the circumstances to seek the assistance of private enterprise, and yesterday negotiations were completed with the agents of Burns, Philp and Co., the well known Queensland shipping firm, whereby a qualified surveyor and assistant surveyor shall proceed to the New Hebrides by ist September, for the purpose of surveying and mapping out all mission lands and the holdings of all **British** settlers who may avail themselves of their services.

* While the Presbyterian Church people are to be highly commended for their action, this responsibility ought not to have been placed upon them ; it is not work for them, but for the **British** Government, in justice to the **British** settlers.

* As soon as the survey is completed the mission will arrange, also with the assistance of Burns, Philp and Co., for a legal expert to proceed to the islands, in order that the claims of the **British** may be properly presented to the joint court.

* These reports, coming to hand from time to time, show a serious condition of things so far as **British** settlers are concerned, and ]  strongly  urge that further representations be made to the Colonial Office, that they should carry out their portion of the  agree- ment with the French Government, and that they should also provide a sufficient number of surveyors to adequately cope with the work that must be taken in hand to protect the interests of **British** settlers.

* I do not l.now whether that work would come within the scope of the **British** authorities solely, or whether the Colonial Office would expect the Federal authorities to bear the cost, either in vhole or in part.

* "If the islands had passed under **British** control, they could have been fortified, and a naval base could have been established.

* She is sending her students to **British** colleges and universities, and all over Europe, to pick up a knowledge of the latest developments of science, and commercial, industrial, and educational advancement, and I look forward to the not far distant future when she will have constitutional government on **British** lines.

* That is another danger which renders it all the more important that we should establish, wherever we can, and as fast and extensively as we can, **British** settlement and occupation of as many islands in the Pacific as we can possibly manage.

* The Department informs me, that according to  Whitaker,  the native population im 1906 was about 100,000, and that the **British** settlers numbered 225, and the French 417.

* In 1902, the **British** numbered 162, and the French 226.

* We know that the **British** population there is diminishing very rapidly.

* The bulk of the trade shown by the Government Statistician to have taken place, indicates that the duty collected cannot be a serious item, and that the competition with our local products is not very material, I am proposing, not a permanent, but a temporary arrangement, by which the **British** and Australian settlers in the islands will be able to find in Australia a market for their intermediate products, whilst they are waiting for their cocoanut plantations to become productive.

* I wish, in conclusion, to give one or two more illustrations of the way in which **British** inte- rests in the Pacific have been neglected.

* I have paid several visits to the Hawaiian islands, and it is within my recollection that at one time there was a wellestablished and extensive trade between those islands and Australia, as well as with other parts of the world, which was carried on by means of **British** ships.

* Desiring to anticipate such action by securing the establishment of a **British** Protectorate over them, he made a special journey to England to interview Queen Victoria on the subject.

* I cannot say whether or not Great Britain contemplated, at a later period, annexing the islands, but negotiations were proceeding for some time to establish over them a joint American and **British** Protectorate.

* The American flag waves over the group, and no trade is permitted to be carried on with them to-day in **British** bottoms.

* **British** trade with those islands is now, I believe, practically a minus quantity.

* I must admit that some, at least, of the members of the present Government, have taken a very great interest in this subject, and the Prime Minister -  Mr. Deakin  - has more than once tried to arouse the attention of the **British** authorities to its significance.

* I was about to say that, since Great Britain is so far removed from the Pacific, and, apparently, takes so little interest in all matters concerning it, I believe the best plan would be for the **British** Government to wash their hands of all responsibility in connexion with these islands and their development, and to hand over their administration to the Commonwealth.

* We should make all these islands Australian territory, and try to do away with the prejudice against the temporary introduction into Australia of products grown by **British** or Australian settlers in the group.

* What would be the duty against **British** manufacturers?

* When we speak of preference to the old countrythe idea in our minds is, I think, that by an arrangement with the mother country we shall be able to get better prices for our goods in **British** markets than we do to-day.

* Is that, however, our object so far as **British** exports to Australia are concerned?

* Do they desire that **British** goods shall command better prices than they do at the present time?

* When we speak of preference from the United Kingdom, we mean that we want better prices for our goods in **British** markets ; but, on the other hand, do we mean that the United Kingdom shall obtain better prices for **British** goods in our markets ?

* But, as far as **British** importsare concerned, I do not think that thereis any man - certainly, there is no onewhom I have met in this country - whowishes to raise their prices.

* Whilst the **British** manufacturer is getting some of the trade represented by the- 34,235, the protection of one halfpenny per lb.

* Consequently the only effect of putting an extra duty on will be that the **British** manufacturer will say, " I can get a little more for my pickles in Australia than I used to.

* It will be seen that the United Kingdom already has the trade, with the exception of  292,101;  and unless, as I said before, the preference is intended so that **British** manufacturers may raise the price to Australian consumers, I should like to know what the gain is in the United Kingdom.

* My desire is that, as **British** people, we should be united and help one another.

* I long ago said to those at the head of this movement, both here and in the old country, that I am in full sympathy with the idea of binding the **British** people together in trade and commerce to a greater extent than at present, but I urged that there should be some definite policy - that the mother country should tell us what she is prepared to give us, and that we ought to be able to say what we are prepared to give to the mother country, and thus arrive at some arrangement mutually satisfactory.

* Such a manufacturer will urge that, however much he would like to give a preference to the mother country, he cannot afford to do so; and the same will be said by the **British** manufacturer.

* I am convinced that neither the **British** Government nor the **British** people would wish us in Australia to injure ourselves in order to confer upon them some benefit - they have too much sense to expect it, and too much regard for us to desire it.

* They know we have a great Imperial work to do on this continent - that the giving of a few thousands, or tens of thousands of pounds in preference to them is as nothing compared to the value of the work which faces us in building up in Australia another home for the **British** race.

* Disaster to the **British** Navy would mean disaster to Australia and the rest of the Empire.

* A national disaster following the defeat of the **British** Navy thousands of miles away from us.

* The small fleet which it is proposed to create will serve a useful purpose in the defence of our harbors and coastal cities, but they will not be able to co-operate with the **British** Navy on the ocean with a view to preventing an enemy destroying our trade and commerce across the sea.

* If the **British** nation is at war, so are we ; if it gains victories or suffers disasters, so do we, and, therefore, it is of the same vital interest to us as to the rest of the Empire that our supremacy on the ocean shall be maintained.

* We are bound also to consider and to fully realize that we belong to a nation which for centuries has been mistress of the sea, and that the position we occupy in Australia to-day in being all **British** territory, and having always enjoyed peace and security, is absolutely attributable to the protection given to us by the **British** flag.

* We then realize fully the great privilege and advantage of being a **British** subject, and feel proud when we see the flag of our Motherland everywhere in evidence, ready, willing, and able to protect us.

* By these means the  personnel  of the Navy would consist to some extent of **British** subjects from different parts of the Empire, and this might in time have the effect of  a  greater personal interest in the Navy being taken by people living outside the **British** Isles than has hitherto been the case when all have been recruited from the Mother Country.

* What would be the use of our being able to repel a cruiser or two for a while, if disaster had fallen on the **British** Navy, and, with the destruction of our commerce, we were isolated from the world, and liable to invasion?

* Foreigners are ousting the **British** sailor more and more each year from **British** ships, and it is not uncommon to find among crews only one or two men natives of this country. "

* That conveys a very clear impression of what the **British** mercantile marine is coming to.

* I appeal to those who are flying preferential kites at the present time to come down to something which affects the Empire much more closely than does preferential trade, and to insist that **British** ships shall be manned by those who are prepared to accept their share of responsibility in defending the Empire.

* Then, again, New Guinea is differentiated altogether from Tasmania, because in Tasmania we have a population of **British** people, who can defend themselves, and who are part and parcel of the  Commonwealth people.

* For the last twenty years we have been pressing on the Home Government questions connected with the New Hebrides, and I am sure honorable members will agree with me that when we heard that the Island of Samoa, in the Pacific, which was essentially **British**, which was civilized and practically dominated by the **British** people, had been given over to the Germans, there was a feeling of shame and indignation throughout the whole of Australia.

* We have a magnificent and economical arrangement with the **British** Government, and, in the near future, I think we might very well increase our annual subsidy towards its maintenance.

* At the same time the **British** Government no doubt say rightly that any disjunction of New Guinea from the Government and territory of Australia would be a menace to us.

* It is practically part and parcel of the mainland of Australia ; and certainly, if the **British** Government areanxious that Australia should be console dated, that we should be free from those disturbing influences which have caused so much trouble elsewhere ; and if we take over willingly - as I believe we shall - that portion of New Guinea which is at present governed by Great Britain, we ought to hav&amp; some word from the Home Government that the acquirement of the whole territory will form part of negotiations in the future.

* It is true that, under those circumstances, twelve or thirteen years ago, New Guinea was annexed by Queensland, and if the advice of that State had been followed by the **British** Government then, we should possibly not have the difficulties which may arise in the future.

* The proposal now before us is that the House shall authorize the Government to accept **British** New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth, if the Home Government are willing to place it .

* We have already, I take it, had a definite expression of opinion from the **British** Government, which is composed of statesmen who are not likely to depart from any undertaking into which they have entered.

* I am quite in accord with the second part of the motion which proposes that 20,000 per annum should be placed in the hands of the Federal Executive in order to defray the expenses of the administration of **British** New Guinea; but I cannot agree to the first part of the motion.

* The United States Constitution, which was framed before there was any idea of entering on a path of expansion, imposes a dozen and one hindrances, and the same will be the case under the Australian Constitution with regard to the territory of **British** New Guinea.

* The most striking utterance in this connexion is that of  Sir Frederick  Treves, who, it will be recollected, accompanied the **British** troops in their march to Ladysmith.

* The article illustrates some of the results of the system of supplying drink to the officers of the army - drink for which the **British** public have to pay.

* Such were the crumbs only which fell from the **British** Officers' mess.

* The Minister has stated that a similar clause w'as brought forward in the **British** Parliament.

* The effect produced in the minds of **British** people was that restrictions and hindrances were placed upon their immigration to Australia.

* Those countries do not confine themselves entirely to **British** people,  but all those who go there become loyal and faithful citizens of the American Republic or loyal citizens under the Crown in Canada.

* Such a position .has never been known in any Parliament in a **British** country.

* The Peninsular and Oriental Company, under arrangement with the **British** Government, will bring the English letters out in ships, probably to some extent manned by coloured crews, and will carry our letters back to Europe, the latter, however, under the poundage system.

* In desiring that the **British**, or,, at any rate, the white race shall, as far as is possible, inhabit Australia, we.

* - Is it not a good thing to train up **British** seamen?

* Upon the occasion referred to 1 asked him whether he could find a trace of any pledges given by the **British** Government to the Hindoo races regarding their admission to all parts of the **British** Empire- 1 p ledges which are contained in proclamations or otherwise.

* The following is a sample passage from that despatch : - 
When bringing the Indian Peninsula under the Sovereignty of the **British** Crown the Imperial Government pledged itself to make no distinction in law either in favour of or against any races or colour.

* Pledges such as those contained in the Proclamation of  Sir Charles  Napier were made at a time when large sections of the **British** nation had sot come into touch with coloured races as they have to-day.

* So far as I am able to form an 'opinion from reading the report of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference, the view entertained bv the leading **British** statesmen is that it behoves Australia to do all that she " can to develop her resources and tq make herself a more efficient integral part of the **British** Empire.

* So  far as the question of preferential trade is concerned, the people of Great Britain would be satisfied if a preference were extended to goods of **British** origin that we are obliged to import.

* There is in some of the Constitutions of the States - and the practice is observed under the **British** Constitution - what I am beginning to regard as a wise provision, namely, that upon a man taking office, he shall present himself before his constituents for re-election.

* But they will require to sternly administer the provisions of this measure if they are to preserve the **British** character of our population.

* treatment, but should propose a preferential Tariff for the advantage- of Great Britain, leaving it open to the **British** Government, if it liked, hereafter to give consideration to Australia.

* The Standard Oil Company reduced the price of its oil in Australia long before the **British** Imperial Oil Company commenced operations here.

* - I have known unscrupulous traders in Queensland and New South Wales to fill White Rose tins with the **British** Imperial Oil Company's oil and to sell it as White Rose kerosene.

* There is certainly a restriction on the introduction of people under contract, but so far as it applies to **British** subjects it is of small importance.

* It is intrinsically objectionable, but the conditions imposed by the law in regard to **British** subjects coming here under contract are very easy.

* Those are the only two conditions attaching to the introduction of **British** immigrants under contract.

* Under the **British** preferential Tariff schedule, instead of reducing duties as we have done in this case, we allow them to remain unaltered, so far as imports from Great Britain are concerned, and increase them as against the foreigner.

* We do not deal with agricultural and mining machinery under the **British** preferential scheme, but under this agreement such imports from South Africa are to receive a preference of 25 per cent.

* He stated that the **British** workman is very poorly paid, but in voting for the same duty against Great Britain as against other countries, the honorable member will be offering the work on the same terms to the foreign workman, who is more poorly paid than the Britisher is.

* No one will contend that **British** workmen are not paid higher wages than are paid to workmen on the Continent.

* As a protectionist, and as one who would go as far as I think any honorable member would to secure preferential trade with the mother land, I regret that the present Government, even in the proposals now before us, have not attempted to carry out what I believe to be the general desire of the House that we should discriminate between **British** and foreign owned ships.

* No ; it is simply a question between **British** ships owned in Australia and all others.

* upon **British**  goods.

* The article to which the honorable member refers contained an estimate given by the **British** Resident, which differs from other estimates in our possession, but it is probable they are not very materially wrong.

* So far as the New Hebrides are concerned the Government are now asking for an increase in the vote from which rebates are paid on produce grown by **British** settlers.

* So far as I am aware, no precedent can be found, either in Australian history or in that of the great mother of Parliaments - the **British** House of- Commons - for the action taken by honorable members opposite.

* There could not, so far, have been such a proposal made by the **British** Parliament.

* We know that  Mr. Chamberlain  is inviting the **British** people to agree to certain proposals which he has outlined.

* enter into  negotiations for preferential trade with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and owe **British** Possessions, and so make the **British** Empire not only self-reliant, but selfdefiant, because, having its food supplier under its own control, the Empire can defy the world.

* The present Prime Minister says that if the **British** Government should ask him to do this he will be content to consider the request.

* But until on the floor of this House the right honorable gentleman has recanted the views to which he has given expression in connexion with the preferential trade movement, how can he be considered a fitting representative of Australia to assist in bringing about reciprocal trade relations with the **British** Empire?

* The subject was mooted as far back as the Ottawa Conference, when, I think, it was suggested that a duty of 5 per cent, should be imposed upon all imports from other than **British** possessions, while  Mr. Hofmeyer,  in 1894, suggested the imposition of duties, beginning at 2 per cent., upon commerce from beyond the Empire, as a subvention towards naval defence.

* That policy did not meet with the approval of men who were then eminent throughout the **British** Possessions.

* Yes ; an attempt to force preferential trade on the **British** Possessions, such as is now being repeated by the Government without the adoption by Parliament of any prefatory resolution.

* In the **British** Budget speech of 1904-5, the total trade of India was given as being valued at ^175,000,000 annually, of which ^77,000,000 fell to the share of the United Kingdom.

* It is a complete misconception that they are in the same nature as a Zollverein, which is a measure of pure free-trade, but happens not to be_ possible for the **British** Empire as a whole- 
It does not seem to be possible.

* In  1905,  the proportion of **British** imports to the total was  60  per cent.

* Besides that, our trade with **British** Possessions has also largely expanded.

* In  1891,  the imports into the Commonwealth from **British** Possessions represented a little more than n per cent, of the total imports, and in  1905  a little more than  14  per cent., while the imports from foreign countries had increased from  18  per cent, to  25  per cent.

* Consequently, I say that there has been a corresponding increase in our trade with **British** Possessions generally, and that it represents a healthy development.

* In July of the present year, the sixth Chamber of Commerce of the Empire adopted a resolution by  105  to  41  votes - twenty-one remaining neutral - in favour of preferential trade upon the ground that thereby "the bonds of union will be strengthened, and the **British** Empire largely freed from dependence upon foreign countries for food and supplies."

* Of the imports into the United Kingdom under this heading in  1905,  the United States contributed  55  per cent., the Argentine  40  per cent., and other countries, including **British** Possessions, only  5  per cent.

* **British** India is at the top of the list, and- then come Russia, the Argentine, the United States, Australasia, and Canada in that order.

* It is no wonder that on 91th January,  1896,  Mr. Chamberlain,  the great protagonist of preferential trade, said - 
This proposal requires that we should abandon our system in favour of theirs, and it is in effect that while the Colonies should be absolutely free to impose what protective duties they please both on foreign and **British** commerce, they would be required to make a small discrimination in favour of **British** trade, in return for which we are expected to change our whole system, and impose duties on food and raw material.

* It does not express the consensus of opinion throughout the **British** Possessions, or the deliberate opinion of the United Kingdom, and it is therefore our duty to give time for further consideration by rejecting the proposal's of the Ministry.

* Yes, the Massey-Harris Company is a **British** company.

* It is a **British** company operating within the charmed circle of the Empire, for the prosperity of which Ministers profess so much concern.

* It is  only  fair that the Massey-Harris Company, as a **British** firm, should know why we are proposing to ruthlessly shut them out of our markets.

* We should be able to look forward with hopefulness to the time when the Commonwealth will be relieved of the expenditure which is at present involved in the administration of the affairs of **British** New Guinea.

* The Australian pioneers had to combat the same difficulty, and if we are to encourage the development of the resources of **British** New Guinea we must take steps in the direction of establishing regular communication between the Territory and the Commonwealth, and also offer reasonable facilities for communication inland by the construction of roads and bridges.

* One of the most discreditable features in connexion with **British** settlement on this continent is that which relates to our treatment of the natives.

* This system would encourage settlement, it would obtain for the use of the general, public what is known as the true economic value of the land, and it would put **British** New Guinea on the road towards nationhood as part and parcel of the Commonwealth.

* It is not likely that the **British** Government would allow us to mint coins exactly the same as their own.

* That was the very laudable ambition of **British** statesmen, and I regret that it has not been realized, and that their dream has been doomed to disappointment.

* In the case of Great Britain most of that money is paid into **British** pockets - that is to say, the commerce of the world is carried in **British** bottoms, and, therefore, the money expended in importing these goods from abroad is paid into the pockets of some **British** subjects.

* Now I do not intend to go into the question of preferential trade, but I am just going to show that these calculations of party Com- missions are not to be relied upon, and how futile they are, owing to the manner in which the questions inquired into are approached, and the sometimes prejudiced reports that are framed,  I  shall do so by pointing out that in the  Times  of a week or two after the report of  Mr. Chamberlain's  Tariff Commission was published there are reports of lectures delivered before the **British** Association by Professor Lotz, of Munich, on the operation of protection in Germany, and another by M. Yves Guyot, a French authority on the effects of protection in France.

* Through the more accidental features in it, and tlie rearrangement of parties on lines less of principles than petty expediency, the members of the alliance cannot, if they come into power, give the country a Cabinet with the essential **British** characteristic of unity of opinion in great matters of policy.

* Unanimity amongst the members of the Government on the broad matters of current policy is the essential feature of the **British** system for the past 150 years.

* Continental Socialism is one thing, **British** Socialism is another.

* 'in paragraph a, a preference of 10 per cent., should be given to **British** imports, when the average preference has been 5 rer cent.

* **British** manufacturers are capable of making almost any kind of machinery which is made in America or any other country.

* I can quite understand that it may not pay **British** manufacturers to produce the articles; but we might encourage them by allowing a preference of 5 per cent.

* I refer to produce grown on land taken up by **British** settlers.

* It is well, however, toremember that one of the ablest of **British** Prime Ministers stated that when the Government were in a corner, the proper thing for them to do was to appoint a Commission.

* We know that the vast mass of the **British** and American workers has amongst its numbers some of the ablest leaders in the world, and that these men, by a large majority,, declare that they do not desire the system.

* As I say, unionism was designed in the first place to correct this, and **British** workers have found that by means of their unions and voluntary arbitration they can adjust disputes arising in that connexion in many of the largest industries.

* I invite the attention of honorable members to an extract from the  **British** Board of Trade Journal  of 25th April, 1901.

* Referring to the gradual decline of **British** imports into France, and pointing out how these imports are gradually being elbowed out by protective duties, the consul says :  - 
This is the prevalent feature in nearly all cases where **British** goods are still sold.

* It comes from the **British** consul at an important town in France, who has noticed a decline of **British** trade on account of protective duties, and he affirms there that, wherever protective duties are put on, the result is that local native manufactures spring up, and the competition amongst local manufacturers results in the price being reduced, even below that of the imported article.

* I think it ought to strengthen and give fresh courage to protectionist members of the House, seeing that our views are supported, not merely by theory but by actual experience, and the observations of influential men in the employment of the **British** Government in various parts of the world.

* They have, one might  say,  formed a world-wide  coalition  against England, and are endeavouring to cut into **British** commercial supremacy.

* The result has been that **British** commerce has been seriously invaded, and these countries are still pursuing their protectionist principles and their determination to have a share of the world's markets.

* In a despatch dated .15th August last, received at the Foreign-office from the **British** Embassy at Washington, it is stated : 
It so happens, that more of the money provided by the taxpayer o the United Kingdom is spent in the **British** dominions beyond the seas than the **British** dominions beyond the seas contribute to the maintenance of the **British** navy.

* He is also themost  acute man in the **British** Empire to-day so far as electioneering dodges are concerned.

* In England, the position was for many years regarded as unsatisfactory ; and  Sir M.  D. Chalmers, an eminent lawyer who had distinguished himself by the preparation of several codes, some of which are in practical operation in various parts of the **British** Empire, approached this subject, and prepared a digest of the whole law with regard to marine insurance.

* Those measures have been enacted by the various .States of .Australia, and also by Parliaments in various parts of the **British** Empire.

* I am at one with him in the belief that it would be well for us to have trade reciprocity with the sister Colony of New Zealand, and I would go so far as to say that it is desirable that we should have reciprocity with other parts of the **British** Empire.

* In reply to the honorable member, I have to say that I am not aware of any pledge given by the **British** Government.

* I think that the matter
            of privilege arises with regard to this House which arose in the **British** House of
            Commons when the Royal Titles Bill was before the Legislature.

* As far as his Majesty the King
            is concerned "I am as loyal a **British** subject as there is.

* I feel that in this
            matter the Minister of External Affairs took a right course when he made the statement
            the other day that he is going to conserve Australian rights, and that he will have
            proper regard to the rights of the **British** people.

* A rebate similar to that for which provision is made in the last preceding Article shall be granted in like manner, and under like provisions, to goods and articles the growth, produce or manufacture of any **British** Colony, Protectorate, or Possession, granting equivalent reciprocal privileges to the Colonies and Territories belonging to Union.

* In conclusion, I would point out that South Africa has deliberately fixed its Tariff at a certain height with a view to making reciprocal concessions to the mother country and other parts of the **British** Empire.

* In any case, this is a treaty which at the present time promises to be distinctly advantageous to us, and I believe beneficial to South Africa, whose Tariff has been deliberately drawn with a view to making this concession to other parts of the **British** Empire.

* George Washington, who was the first man to haul down the **British** flag, was only a country surveyor.

* It is a body the members of which have shown their loyalty to the **British** Empire perhaps more than any other force in Australia.

* I take it that the object of the motion is not only to deal with anomalies, but to secure a Board, on the lines of the **British** Board of Trade, which will include, as the motion states, representatives of particular staple interests affected by Customs Tariff Acts.

* The only other definition, of the word that I have been able to obtain is frorm the  **British** Encyclopaedia  for 1898, which contains the following - 
It may be, as stated by the honorable member for Mernda, that in no part of the **British** Empire is the union label recognised as_a trade mark; but  I  know that I used to receive a journal on the lines of the **British**  Board of Trade Gazette,  published by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, which bore the union label, so that the Government of that country recognises the system.

* I admit that the use of the label is not sanctioned by law in other **British** countries, but that is because the system has worked so well that it has been found unnecessary to pass a law to establish it.

* But unless the practice of the **British** Parliament is followed, and they are tabled before the beginning of the financial year, I do not think that the Government are acting reasonably.

* Therefore, we might well remit the duties on the articles, instead of voting a sum which would amount to only a miserable dole to the **British** settlers.

* If  it is intended to offer a sum by way of a bonus to **British** settlers, then, in view of the disabilities which they have had to suffer through the legislation of the Commonwealth, it would not have beentoo much had the Prime Minister asked the Committee to vote 500 to each settler who has been adversely affected by our enactments.

* I am informed that, owing to the persistent efforts of the French authorities to get **British** and 
Australian settlers to foreswear their allegiance, some of them find their loyalty to the **British** flag so strained that, face to face with the choice between starvation and prosperity they are inclined to accept the protection which is offered to them by the French authorities.

* Possessing that information, and also knowing that the islands are required by the French for strategic purposes rather than for commercial reasons, the Commonwealth Government have nevertheless put forth no helping hand to the unfortunate **British** and Australian settlers.

* But beyond that, I understand that if we interfere with **British** vessels the **British** Government can exercise their power of veto.

* That is the general attitude of the **British** employer.

* Whatever the faults of the Opposition may be, it is a pleasure to me to sail with a crew that is **British** in its sympathy, and has aspirations embracing the welfare of the Empire.

* If he had so keen an admiration for the progress made by the **British** people during the reign of her late Majesty,  Sir Edmund  Barton might well have brought forward his proposal at the first opportunity.

* I believe that the bulk of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth - those of **British** descent and inclinations - will be well satisfied if we vote 25,000 for this purpose.

* The special knowledge which the people of the Commonwealth possess of the dangers which may result from Chinese immigration, added, I think, to the conviction which we all hold, that the future tranquility of South Africa absolutely depends on a large influx thereto of the white race of **British** extraction, are facts which make it almost incumbent on us to warn the Empire of the dangers which, we think, a sister State is on the high road to incur.

* That gentleman had no precedent for so doing; and the **British** Government have so far evidenced no desire to interfere, nor have they had any excuse for interference in the affairs of this Commonwealth.

* Scattered over the face of the world, each section of the **British** people has in the past devoted itself to the development of its own territory, free from all restraint, except the generous dictates of its own conscience.

* I find from the  Shipping  World Year-Book  for last year that the number of vessels entered from **British** possessions and foreign countries to the United Kingdom was 66,840, carrying 55,623,974 tons, and that the number of vessels cleared to **British** possessions and foreign countries from the United Kingdom was 65,880, carrying 56,416,700 tons.

* The imports into Great Britain from **British** possessions and foreign countries were valued at .565,019,917, and the exports at 407,596,527.

* It is an English company with English directors, and naturally - and I do not blame them for it - they preferred to obtain **British** machinery.

* .- If we limit the preference to goods carried in ships upon which only **British** white seamen are employed, goods carried in any vessel upon which  a  foreigner or  a  Britisher who is not white is employed will be penalized to the extent of the increased duty.

* So far as I can make out, no very large preference will be given to **British** manufacturers.

* At best, we cannot expect **British** trade to increase to the extent of more than 500,000 per annum, and I would ask the honorable member for Barrier, who has enthusiastically supported the amendment, and whom I congratulate upon having been able to look serious all the time, how many vessels employed in the trade between here and the old country are likely to change the character of their crews for the sake of the small share of additional freight that would fall to their lot?

* We should not load **British** goods with conditions which would have the effect of placing them upon the same footing as foreign products.

* Undoubtedly the **British** governing authorities have to look at this matter from a large stand-point.

* At one time during the debate there was a feeling that the **British** authorities were not prepared to allow us to legislate to the full extent necessary for our protection ; but I was glad to learn, from the very able address delivered by the Attorney-General, that that is not so, and that the **British** authorities do not raise the question of our right to legislate upon this subject.

* I think that the more honest course to pursue with respect to the races which we desire to exclude, the **British** authorities, and the voters whom we represent, is to pass legislation which we believe will be effective.

* Only the other day we received a cablegram to say that one of the Canadian States proposed to adopt an educational test for the exclusion of certain immigrants, and that the **British** Government, at the instance of Japan, had induced the Canadian authorities to disallow that legislation.

* They object to it as such, and use their powers of diplomacy with the **British** Government to bring about a disallowance of the legislation.

* Only in to-day's newspapers we read that the **British** Government is already preparing to defend this country by the establishment of a naval base at Singapore.

* This nation is an integral portion of the great **British** Empire, and I would a hundred times prefer to shut up all our forts and military business, and give England 500,000 a year towards the upkeep of her Navy, if that were shown to be necessary.

* No nation can invade Australia without attacking the whole **British** Empire.

* This great country in the Southern Hemisphere was laid out by the Creator for the surplus **British** population when all other countries would be filled; He preserved it, and walled it up by the eternal seas for this purpose.

* This provision will bring us abreast of the latest **British** law upon the subject of patents.

* It will give us the benefit of the advance which has been made in the **British** law after the experience which they have gained of the unsatisfactory results of granting patents without previous searching of the records.

* He is a master of the **British** system, but when he went to America he examined the United States system, which he had always admired and preferred to the **British** system.

* We have followed the course adopted by the **British** Patent Office last year, and we are taking a still further stride in advance.

* I am not quite sure that I saw the telegram referred to, but I know that the distance of Australia from England makes it difficult to obtain remounts here for the use of the **British** Army in the United Kingdom.

* The **British** Government was invited by me, on behalf of this Government, to establish remount stations in Australia, but the representations which I made on the subject have not been favorably considered.

* The **British** race naturally " takes on " the places which can be most rapidly developed.

* I wish to know from the Prime Minister if, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, he has become aware of the circumstances connected with the alleged unlawful imprisonment, in November last, of a citizen of this Commonwealth named Captain John Strachan, who, I understand, is a justice of the peace in the State of New South Wales, and alleges that he was unlawfully imprisoned and his ship illegally seized by the authorities of the **British** North Borneo Company?

* I also wish to know if the Government have made any representations about the case to the Imperial Government, with a view to having Captain Strachan's statement thoroughly investigated, so that the rights and liberties of Australian and **British** traders whose business may take them into the **British** North Borneo Company's territory may be properly protected ?

* Already the **British** Government are making inquiries as to whether the mails for India cannot be sent out by rail.

* up to the war in South Africa; but if it had been understood at the outset that **British** and Australian money and blood were to be expended in that war fbr the mere purpose of securing for a few absentee millionaires an opportunity to tear out the natural wealth of the country at a cost less than that which would be involved by the employment of even native labour, I feel satisfied that the people of Australia would not have entered into the struggle with the same determination and zeal that characterized their efforts.

* We felt that we were fighting for other interests, and that fact should have some weight with the **British** Government, and lead them to veto the proposed introduction of Chinese labour at all events until the wishes of the people directly concerned have been ascertained.

* If that great country is to be part and parcel of the **British** Empire, and if the racial differences which have been intensified by the late war are to be removed, this proposal should not be carried out.

* The action of the Prime Minister of New Zealand was worthy of him, and creditable to that portion of the **British** Empire.

* I have every admiration and respect for the right honorable gentleman who has controlled so ably and so long the destinies of New Zealand, and no belittling reference to him can detract from the great reputation which he has won and the important position which he holds in the **British** community to-day.

* But on the island continent of Australia, which is far away from the turmoil of Europe, we ought to mind our own business, and build up a country worth fighting for - a country which will belong to the people, and not to **British** or foreign money-lenders.

* They have strongly urged that a constitution should be granted to **British** New Guinea without any further delay.

* Honorable members should not forget that the principle of prohibition in relation to **British** New Guinea has been affirmed, not only by the present House of Representatives, but by the House of Representatives of the first Parliament.

* Only to the extent that I hope it may lead honorable members to decide against State control of the liquor traffic in **British** New Guinea.

* That is, work for the **British** Government, I presume.

* It is true that the **British** Imperial Oil Company brings oil to Australia in tank steamers, but what labour does it employ?

* I have : seen the **British** Imperial Company's tank steamers unloading in Port Jackson, and all the labour that they employed was two Malays- 
That is a matter for future consideration.

* Whatever our views may be in regard to our harbor defences, and however much we may appreciate the valour of our citizen soldiers, we recognise that the strength of the Empire as a sea power rests in the **British** Navy.

* the **British** Army.

* I appreciate the value of the **British** Navy to Australia as the first line of defence, and to that extent, at all events, my views coincide with those of the honorable member; but every man in Australia ought to have a sense of responsibility to his country, and should be in a position to defend it if the occasion arose.

* There ought not to exist halfadozen interpretations of laws upon the same subject, one for Australia, another for South Africa, a third for Canada, and others for other **British** possessions.

* I am of opinion that by the  possession  of one Court of Appeal for the whole **British** race, whose decisions ure final and binding on all the Courts of the Empire, there is constituted a bond between all **British** people which should be maintained inviolate as the keystone of Imperial unity.

* This is a very important question, and I hope that the Committee will not be led by the representations of any of the teetotal fanatics in this Chamber to totally prohibit the liquor traffic in **British** New Guinea.

* per bottle, whereas on the **British** territory the same liquor is sold at from 14s.

* I do not; but the whole of the evidence at our disposal shows that the drink traffic in **British** New Guinea has been so well controlled that the natives have not become drunkards.

* Sir, - For more than forty years I have been a worker, and not an idle one, with those who have been striving to keep intoxicating drinks and other evils from the native races of Polynesia, and nothing has given me so much satisfaction as the exceptionally effective legislation of the **British** Government in New Guinea.

* agreement in proposing that the Commonwealth should adopt the **British** ordinances at present in force, and amend nothing until knowledge has been gained by experience.

* That, with a view to promote and encourage settlement by people of our own race in the Southern Pacific Islands - particularly in the New Hebrides group - it is desirable to allow a rebate of duties on all produce grown by **British** and Australian settlers in those islands coming into the Commonwealth.

* We have observed, with feelings of profound satisfaction, the evidence afforded by the recent speeches from the Throne, and debates thereon in the House of Lords and Commons of the United Kingdom, and also from Your Most Gracious Majesty's recent visits to Ireland, of a sincere desire on all sides to usher in a new era of lasting peace -and goodwill in Ireland, and this House congratulates the mother country on the just and equitable legislation recently passed on the land and education questions, and hopes for an early and lasting settlement of the troublesome problem of the government of Ireland, which has taxed the powers of **British** statesmen for so long.

* Upon that occasion we did our best to assist the **British** Government.

* We all know that the vast majority of **British** troops which took part in the South African war were Irish, and that the majority of the generals also claimed Ireland as their place of birth.

* In the interests of **British** dominion in the South Pacific, and in the interests of the trade of Australia with the islands, it is very unwise to charge so high a duty as this.

* He then went home to England to attend the **British** School of Musketry, and qualified as an instructor in musketry, the use and mechanism of the machine gun, and the range finder.

* We are proposing to extend preferential treatment to **British** goods introduced in **British** bottoms, and we have to guard against injustice.

* When the importers, after this motion had been introduced, sought to release it they were asked to pay duty upon the higher scale imposed under this schedule on **British** goods brought out in foreign vessels.

* It would be unfair to subject **British** goods brought out in foreign bottoms prior to the introduction of this motion to the higher rate of duty.

* When they were shipped the importers did not know that a preference was going to be given in respect of goods imported in **British**  bottoms.

* I may mention that the Fines Recovery Act of 1837 was purely a lawyers' Bill, and was the only Bill ever passed through the **British** Parliament without being amended either in Committee or House by the House of Commons or House of Lords.

* It may surprise honorable members to know that about 98 per cent, of the **British** currency is made up of bills of exchange and cheques.

* al so from the Imperial point "of view, because bills of exchange and cheques practically constitute the chief method of settling final balances now-a-days, and the law, as much as possible, ought to be the same throughout the **British** Dominions.

* This fact is very important, and in itself alone it is sufficient reason for the inclusion in the Commerce Bill, which is based so largely upon the **British** Act, and the objection brought forward to the Commerce Bill does not extend to controverting the wisdom of the **British** law which prevails so largely in the various parts of the **British** Empire.

* The reason for its inclusion becomes still stronger when we consider how it came to be adopted in the **British** Act.

* Its adoption in England was the result of a recommendation by the Committee of the **British** Parliament in 1890, which reported as follows : - " The evidence given before your Committee was, in their opinion, conclusive proof that goods (notably articles of consumption) come into this country in large quantities in an adulterated form, but cannot, according to the evidence given by the Customs authorities, be detained under section 3  (d)  and () of the M. M. A., because in most instances they bear no trade description as defined by sections 3 and 5 of the said Act."

* The States of Queensland, New South W'ales, and "Victoria have spoken upon this question of **British** supremacy in New Guinea, and they have contributed from their respective revenues towards the expenses of carrying on the government and maintaining control of the possession, The general regret, is not that that step has been taken, but that it was not taken earlier and more effectively than was possible when action was decided upon, and that the whole of New Guinea Ls not under **British** control.

* If we refuse to secure and maintain the control of **British** New Guinea, other Continental powers will come in and take possession.

* the **British**  Government withdrew from **British**.

* I recognise that the future of **British** New- Guinea will depend to a certain extent upon the form of government and administration which is introduced there.

* Speculators in the old world, recognising that **British** New Guinea, by reason of its contiguity to Australia and all its latent powers, will develop into a great territory,, wish to acquire land monopolies there, and it is only by the strong opposition offered by the States themselves that this has been prevented.

* In seeking to insert the words, the Attorney-General is acting only in accordance with the great bulk of criminal legislation, not only in Victoria, but in every other State of the Commonwealth, and every part of the **British** Empire.

* We are all proud of the growth of Australia as a whole, and whether an Australian State take upon itself the policy of free-trade or protection, I believe that State, in spite of any policy, with **British** energy and the spirit of **British** freedom, would be a successful State.

* He was particularly anxious that as far as possible within a certain area **British** rule should exist absolutely.

* But in dealing with a question like this, we are practically intermediary and not primary movers ; because, after all, it is a question for the **British** Government.

* At the same time, the information and public feeling must come from us, and I re-echo what an honorable member said in this debate, that any attempt, such as that proposed by  Mr. Seddon,  to create another Federation in the Southern seas must be ultimately fatal to the integrity of the **British** Empire.

* I believe the future of the **British** Empire will mean, together with the central Government, a great confederation of Canada, a great confederation of South Africa, and a great confederation of Australia.

* But if we create another Federation alongside ourselves in the Pacific, we create possible differences between two Federations in the same geographical area-; and if there is friction between two of the outlying parts of the **British** Empire, it will be almost impossible for **British** conciliation to prevent a rupture.

* At present the employment of black labour, and of white alien labour, which is worse, is being encouraged, and the **British** merchant marine is being used for the purpose of training white aliens, who may become our most serious opponents in time of trouble.

* I find that, according to recent statistics, the total number of men employed in the **British** mercantile marine is about 250,000.

* This, in itself, is serious enough, but a still greater danger is indicated by the fact that during the fifteen years, ending 1900, the number of men employed in the **British** mercantile marine has increased by 43,000, of which number 19,000, or nearly onehalf, were coloured aliens.

* Out of an increase of 43,000 in the number of persons engaged in the **British** mercantile marine during fifteen years, only 12,000 were "boys of the bull dog breed."

* It provides for the  validation of marriages between certain persons in cases where, at the date of the marriage, each 'of the parties was domiciled in a part of the **British** Possessions in which, at that date, such marriage was legal.

* It was not the closely massed battalions of the **British** Empire, but the extended columns of the mounted infantry vhich successfully combated the Boers, and if we are called upon to fight we shall probably be required to do so under almost exactly the same conditions as the residents in the Transvaal.

* and not compelled to act as the **British** were, on the offensive.

* We had the assistance of an officer in Victoria, who is second to none in any part of the **British** Empire as an authority on explosives.

* The standard of value in Canada is the **British** sovereign, and, in the United States, the $10 gold eagle.

* The amount that itf is estimated we should lose by the adoption of penny postage is 200,000 per annum - a sum which is equal to our annual contribution to the maintenance of the **British** Squadron stationed in Australian waters.

* Although we have an unprotected coast line of  8.000  miles, it does not seem to have yet been realized that our first line of defence is the **British**.

* It is interesting to note that two-thirds of the imports into the Commonwealth come from **British** Possessions.

* But I desire to point out that something more than is now proposed is due to those who are endeavouring to establish **British** influence in the islands.

* Sooner or later they will have to declare themselves, and in view of the fact that the question of the settlement of population upon our soil is a vital one, and that no mention whatever is made of any proposal to grapple with that problem- 
Were these rifles sent in this condition by the **British** War Office ; and is it further true that no bayonets have been supplied with these rifles?

* The policy of the Imperial Government, which, I presume^ we followed so far .as the mail subsidy was concerned, was to subsidize mail steamers first, for the carrying of the mails ; secondly, in order to assist the shipbuilding industry ; thirdly, to provide swift armed cruisers; and fourthly, to maintain the supremacy of **British** commerce.

* It it be desired to encourage the shipbuilding industry, a Shipbuilding Bonus Bill should be introduced; if we wish to help the Imperial Government to maintain armed cruisers, our naval vote should be debited with a proportionate share of the subsidy, and if we decide to join in maintaining the supremacy of **British** commerce, the Customs Department should bear a share of the burden.

* Although I am a free-trader, I frankly confess :that when I travel - which I do very occasionally - I like to ,do so upon a vessel flying the **British** -flag.

* If the **British** Government will submit a proposal to us, or if our own Government will submit a proposal, I shall be prepared to listen to it.

* Those two honorable members said that they want this duty to be imposed in order to save  the  **British** Imperial Oil Company from the clutches of an octopus, the Standard OiCompany.

* I would point out to the honorable member for Riverina that the company on whose behalf he has spoken is not a **British** company, as he stated, but a Straits Settlements Company.

* Most of the opponents of the BUI have contended that it is the prerogative of the **British** employer to be the master of his own business, and that the State should not interfere for the purpose of regulating it.

* Even the **British** moneylender will make advances on Turkish bonds when **British** consols are low.

* He win lend money on the  rottenest  security in the world when **British** consols are so low that it pays him to inflate the market elsewhere.

* By the Prime Minister's forecast of his intention, I was led to expect that some of the objections taken by the **British** people to the Immigration Restriction Act would be removed by the Bill.

* After all these have been successfully overcome, the Minister will still be in a position to reject any immigrant, whether **British** or foreign, who may come out under contract.

* But, instead of doing that, it puts greater difficulties in the way of the admission of our fellow **British** citizens and others into Australia, and in addition preserves all the powers which are vested in the Minister under the principal Act.

* I have not been so much annoyed by the statements which have been published in the Continental newspapers regarding: the conduct of our troops in South Africa, as I have been distressed by the statements which from time to&gt; time have emanated from persons to whom the honour of the **British** troops should be as dear- as that of the members of their ownhouseholds.

* I do not intend to enter into the merits of the dispute, nor am I going into the causes which led up to the war ; but in my opinion every loyal subject of the Empire, now that we have entered into the war, should, so long as it is conducted upon the principles upon which the honorable and learned member admits that it has been conducted, assist by every means in his power to give a victory to **British** arms, not solely for the subjugation of a free people, but to make life and liberty in South Africa secure, to maintain the integrity of the Empire and to prevent not only a very grave danger to Cape Colony and Natal, **British** possessions pure and simple, but a great danger to Australia itself.

* If a plebiscite were taken in the Commonwealth; it would be found that an enormous majority of the people are in favour of every word in this motion, that they are prepared to do their utmost to uphold the prestige, the honour, and the dignity of **British** arms, and that they approve of the Commonwealth accepting the responsibility which belongs to its position within the Empire, and devoting, if need be, its last man and its last farthing - all we possess - in order to defend the integrity of the Empire to which we belong.

* Nothing, however, could be more repugnant to **British** instincts than compulsion of that kind.

* I am certain that not only here but in every English-speaking community I know of, the word conscription carries with it a disagreeable sound, while as a principle it is not likely to be willingly adopted in any **British** community.

* Clauses 48 and 111, which give power to send the men abroad and place them under the command of **British** officers, are thoroughly wrong in spirit, and they are not in accordance with the traditions of this country.

* We should not, as a Government and a nation, encourage the entering into these disputes, but should keep out of them as much as possible, although we can safely rely on the **British** patriotism of the community to take a hand if necessary when there is any fighting going on.

* I think that the genius of the **British** race will enable our people to display sufficient skill to bring this about.

* Mildura, in short, affords a unique example of a community of **British** settlers - plucky, enterprising colonists - settling upon land in the centre of an Australian wilderness, imbued with free-trade ideas, and becoming converted to protection by the force of hard contact with the actual conditions of life.

* If we are possessed of the **British** pluck with which we ought to be endowed, one or two failures ought not to discourage us.

* In this way our products, when placed on the **British** market, would enjoy a much greater prestige than they secure as the products of individual States.

* Now, I wish in the first place to say that, in my opinion, it is seriously at variance with that system of parliamentary government to which **British** communities are accustomed, that the leader of this House and head of the Government should have so ostentatiously abandoned his position in the Chamber during these prolonged Tariff debates.

* I am not ignorant of the great calls upon the Prime Minister, but I hold that what Ministers like the **British** Ministers can do, with the vast responsibilities devolving upon them, our Prime Minister must do.

* From 1891 to 1900, the net **British** imports, after deducting re-exports of foreign and colonial produce, were 1,455,000,000 in excess of exports.

* These goods are turned over in **British** factories, fill **British** shops, and feed **British** people cheaply.

* one to move a request for a preference to **British** cotton seed.

* The  Argus  afterwards attempted to fasten upon me a charge that I was referring -to all contract labour coming to Australia as chattel labour, and it has further attempted to fasten upon me the charge that I referred to people of the **British** Islands coming out to this country under contracts, however good they might be, as mere "chattels."

* In the issue of that newspaper for 13th October, I am reported to have said - 

 Mr. Isaacs, having previously described **British** subjects who come to Australia under contract 
Certainly  Mr. Isaacs'  race owes an inextinguishable debt to the **British** people.

* They are not less loyal as **British** citizens because they worship in a different form from others.

* The article goes on to say - 
He should reflect that if the principles he now so unsparingly advocates had been adopted in earlier days in the **British** Isles, his race would never have obtained a footing there.

* I do not forget, and I trust that I shall never forget, the magnanimous treatment which my race has received at the hands of the **British** people; but I cannot forget either that not only the **British** people, but every other people on this earth - I do not care in what department of life, even though it should be in connexion with the most sacred foundations of our society - is under great obligations to the people of my race, and amongst them there is, from Sacred Writ, the command - 
That was agreed to without a division.

* It is not necessary, I am sure, for me to show - because honorable members already know it - that there was no intention on my part to take the attitude ascribed to me by the  Argus,  and that there was no justification for stating that I cast any opprobrium upon the **British** workingman.

* They believed that we should if possible lend a helping  hand  to the **British** Imperial Oil Company, who have established vast works at Williamstown, and helped to maintain a stan-.

* I think that on these grounds the duty ought to be supported by those who "are in favour of main-, taining  a.  healthy competition, especially by a **British** company as against that octopus, tire world-wide Standard Oil Company.

* I have been given to understand that a considerable amount of **British** capital is invested in the **British** Imperial Oil Company.

* Whether their mines are on **British** or Asiatic soil is not the chief consideration.

* The ' fact that they are operated by **British** capital guides me in endeavoring to give them some assistance and support.

* I think that all that we are required to do is to frame laws under which applications may be made by aliens to become naturalized **British** subjects.

* All we can do is to specify the conditions under which an alien may be hall-marked as a **British** subject.

* question of land settlement, and has been considered worthy to be appointed bv the **British** Government to report upon it, not only in the **British** Empire, but in the United States, on the Continent, and elsewhere.

* I notice that some **British** soldiers have refused to eat the products of the Chicago meat packers.

* I should like to see the right honorable gentleman made the first Treasurer of the Federated **British** Empire, so that he would have an opportunity to give play to his hopeful ideas.

* Would it hesitate if it were not afraid of the **British** nation?

* I am willing that a few thousand pounds should be spent annually in maintaining rifle clubs, and, if we do not wish, to maintain a navy of our own, I am agreeable to making a contribution towards the maintenance here of ships of the **British** Navy.

* Further schemes had been prepared for the defence of **British** ports, which the  speaker  confidently anticipated would be placed in a position to resist any sudden attack.

* They have time and again proclaimed their convictions that Australians cannot do anything -in defence apart from England', and that our true policy would be to quadruple our Naval Subsidy of ^200,000, and place our interests candidly under the protection of the **British** flag without any aspirations after Australian ships and Australian sailors.

* You can go round the warehouses in York-street, Clarence-street, and Kent-street, Sydney, and upon the shelves you will find, not **British**, but German goods.

* If they can save 5d., they will 'take German goods in preference to **British**, and then go down to the Town Hall and dictate to the working men as to how much they should pay out of their hard earnings- to give a  Dreadnought  to England to defeat the German Navy.

* So in the press of this very week the honorable member for Parkes states that Australians had been maligned and unjustly discredited in the eyes of the **British** people by the honorable member for Ballarat, whom he is supporting to-night.

* They have taken for granted that the Australian is of the same nature and of the same capacity as the man who stands in the rank and file of the **British** army.

* That, in my opinion, has been the real reason of the success of our men there, and the great mistake which is made by military experts who all hail from the other side of the globe is that they do not recognise these differences in the rank and file of our Australian volunteer and partially-paid regiments, and the rank and file of the **British** army.

* It is undoubted that the power of initiative shown by the Australian is unknown amongst the highly trained machine-like soldier of the **British** army.

* I do not for one moment decry the mental capacity of the rank and file of the **British** array, but I feel I am on perfectly safe ground when I say that comparing them with the Australians who went to South Africa, they are not in the same street as regards education.

* To seek to apply a prohibition law to such a. territory as that of **British** New Guinea would be to endeavour to do something absolutely .

* With a coast-line and borders that can be approached from any point, **British** New Guinea would offer considerable inducements to smuggling and to the illicit distillation of liquors.

* A few days before he made his second-reading speech the Minister of Trade and Customs was beating the drum on behalf of preferential trade in Great Britain, and, on the grounds of loyalty to the Empire, was advocating that we should import **British** goods upon better terms than those accorded to foreigners.

* I said 3^80,000, and in round numbers I may say that **British** manufactures, under the division " Metals and Machinery," represent  4,000,000.

* For years probably that railway would not pay, but he believed that Western Australia would be connected by rail with the other States just as the State of **British** Columbia was connected with the other States of Canada.

* I believe if he had done that the South Australian people, who are as honorable and upright and **British** as any people in Australia, would have said, "Yes, you made the compact as our Premier and as our representative, and we will keep it."

* We have in Western Australia a country with a fine climate, a good soil, and an abundant rainfall, where we can make homes for hundreds of thousands under conditions to which **British** people are accustomed.

* It mav be retarded for a little while, but to tell me that we, a **British** community of 4,000,000 people - and we shall soon be 10,000,000 - are going to be content to let the western State remain separated from the eastern States for long is to tell me something which I refuse to believe.

* We all recollect that when the Boer war commenced, and the princes of India came forward, with noble fidelity, and loyally offered troops of their races to the **British** Government, that Government said - " No ; we decline with thanks.

* What 
Surely it could not be more despotic, if we can use .such a term at all, than the proposal which is now suggested  t  It could not be more despotic than to say that **British** subjects, because they are black, are to be excluded  1  It could not be more despotic than that.

* And, what is more important to us at the present time, we could get that provision through as part of this Bill without any hesitation on the part of the **British** Government.

* We do not want to say to the **British** Government - " Here is something which proclaims on the face of it antagonism to one important nation ; here is something which draws a distinction between powerful nations here is something which says that a German or Frenchman may enter Australia, but that a Japanese must not."

* We know that if we were deprived of the advantage of **British** protection we should not sleep so soundly or securely as we do at the present time.

* This Act has been passed since  Mr. Chamberlain  took up the high attitude of telling the various Australian Premiers, in 1897, that the **British** Government would not sanction any Bill that would place disabilities on certain Asiatics, and upon Japanese in particular.

* Well, these lascars 'are **British** subjects, and the inhabitants of a country which pays an enormous amount of the postal subsidies to the mail steamers, so that, as far as the lascars are concerned, they being **British** subjects, and the country in which .they are born, being a country which contributes enormously to the postal subsidies, it becomes a great difficulty for the Government of Australia to have its wishes carried out.

* I think the Prime Minister unnecessarily referred to this as a fiscal matter, but I wish the Prime Minister to remember that, as far as the **British** flag is concerned, it is not a fiscal matter,  bceause  it endeavours to give the utmost amount of freedom beneath its folds to men of every race, and every colour, and every creed.

* Why does not the honorable member draw the line at Chinese tea, and drink colonial beer  1  I will guarantee that with all the fiscal views of my honorable friend, you will often see him drinking **British** beer, .but you will never see him by any chance drinking a glass of the colonial article.

* Honorable members opposite will know that two sets of representations as to what is Australian sentiment and aspiration, in regard to naval affairs, have been made to the Imperial Government; They have been told, on the one hand, that Australia aspires to possess a flotilla of torpedo boats and torpedo-boat destroyers; and, on the other, that it wishes to contribute a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Navy.

* In the course of time we shall find the various portions of the **British** Empire trading with each other in a reciprocal way, and to their mutual advantage.

* When the conditions of labour in the two countries have been adjusted, I hope that we shall be able to reduce our duties upon goods of **British** origin.

* He said - 
 So that you see under the system of preference, or the mitigated form of protection which it is proposed your Tariff should now take, it is essential for your purpose in the exercise of your fiscal independence, and in the maintenance as you conceive it to be of your economic interests, to exclude the **British** manufacturers to a large extent from your markets.

* That is not a sudden or hastily formed opinion on the part of the **British** people.

* Now, it seems that one of them, at any rate, is going to try to stab the members of this House in a way which I venture to say is not in accord with any **British** precedent.

* The honorable member for Fremantle has admitted our dependence for defence upon the **British** Navy ; and my whole point is that if Great Britain cannot continue to maintain that command of the seas upon which we have to place dependence, all sections of the **British** people should combine for their common defence.

* And in the course of my speech on the Treasurer's financial statement, I have already indicated the great difficulties in the way of our heedlessly increasing in a material way our contribution to the **British** Navy until there shall have been created a new Imperial authority with responsibility for Imperial defence.

* The motion speaks of "an Imperial," not of a " **British**," navy.

* The honorable member for Fremantle admits our dependence on the **British** Navy.

* The possession of cruisers would not prevent a hostile force landing in Australia when once the command of the seas had been wrested from Great Britain ; and the honorable member admits that when he declares that we are dependent upon the protection afforded us by the **British** Navy.

* His  idea of an Australian Squadron which shall act in concert with the **British** Navy is that any raiding cruiser which, despite the **British** command of the seas, may be able to visit our coast, shall be met by a force of Australian ships.

* I fear that I cannot have made it quite clear why an Australian Navy would not augment the strength of the **British** fleets elsewhere.

* The honorable member forFremantle stated that an Australian fleet could be taken abroad, and could act in concert with the **British** Navy.

* For that reason, the **British** fleets have been collected in the neighbourhood, in order that they may be in a position to dart upon these foreign armaments immediately war is declared - the idea being that they may be able, with the least possible delay, to move upon and blockade the naval bases of our enemies.

* But if an Australian fleet is to act in conjunction with the **British** Navy, what would happen in time of war?

* The point I wish to make against the suggestion that an Australianowned navy would be able to act to the greatest advantage elsewhere in cooperation with the **British** Navy is that one of the essentials to the success of naval effort is homogeneity in construction, material, and efficiency.

* **British** battleships, however, can train four to each broadside, two forward and two aft.

* It is obvious from this that if a commander of a **British** fleet could manage to so arrange his vessels that they would present four guns to a broadside of three guns from the enemy, he would possess a great advantage over the foreign commander.

* This being so, the **British** Navy spends almost double as much in Australia as we contribute to its maintenance.

* After all, Australia is an important part of the **British** Empire, and 35,000 means a contribution of something like 2d.

* We have of late seen the outcome of a military spirit which was inevitable, the **British** nation being at war, and the whole Empire involved in trouble.

* To do such a thing is against all principles of **British** justice, and against the recognised precept that in all judicial proceedings we should hear both sides.

* I do not blame him for that, although, in- my opinion, his judgment has at times been in opposition to the fundamental principle of **British** justice.

* Some reference has been made to a statement by the honorable member for Kooyong, that injustice might be done under the Bill, and what I say is that if it were at first limited to shearers, seamen, and railway men - as the Committee has decided to include railway men- 
.- The proposal of the Government is one which deserves attention for at least one reason ; it is the first attempt to distinguish between the **British** producers and those of other countries.

* In the report of a lecture delivered by  Mr. de  Lissa, who is connected with the **British** Empire League, of which the honorable and learned member for Parkes is  President,  appear a number of excellent reasons why the various parts of the Empire should be drawn closer together, and preferential trade was .mentioned as one of the ways of doing this.

* The attitude of the Opposition towards the **British** Government presents a contradiction for which I think party motives are responsible.

* I regret that the proposition is not to lower rates in favour of **British** goods, retaining the old rates against foreign goods ; but what has been done is perfectly justifiable and logical, so far as a Protectionist Government is concerned.

* The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has moved an amendment providing that preference shall be given only in respect to goods made by white **British** workmen.

* But, with the exception, perhaps, of the clothing trade in the east end of London, I think that none but white **British** workmen, are employed in the United Kingdom.

* Unfortunately, the fact that goods have been made by a white man and a Britisher is not a guarantee that they have been made under decent conditions, because it is only too true that many white **British** workmen are compelled to labour for wages which are insufficient, and under conditions which are disgraceful.

* The honorable member has also given notice of his intention to move that preference shall be given only in respect to goods brought here in ships, manned exclusively by white **British** seamen.

* be  Chairman,  found that the number of **British** seamen is steadily .

* Anything which can be done to arrest this tendency, which may, without exaggeration, be termed a fatal one, should be adopted ; but if we provide that preference shall be given only in respect of goods imported on vessels manned exclusively by white **British** seamen, the result will be that Great Britain will be unable to take advantage of the proposal.

* I do' not hesitate to say that, during the whole of the present year, not one ship entering any port of Australia and coming from Great Britain, has been manned exclusively by **British** seamen.

* I think, therefore, that the honorable member would do well to amend his amendment, and if he does not do so, I shall make the attempt by providing that preference shall be given only in respect to goods imported in **British** ships of whose crews 80 per cent", are **British** seamen.

* Taking into account Lascars, about 66 per cent, of the seamen on board **British** vessels are white Britisheis.

* Therefore, it will be seen that if the **British** ship-owners were told that they could not take advantage of the preference so long as they employed one foreign sailor, they would be unable to accept it.

* At the same time, I am very anxious to encourage the employment of Britishers on board the vessels of the **British** mercantile marine, and I think the condition of 80 per cent.

* It was in the following terms : - " As the result of correspondence which has passed between the **British** and German Governments with respect to the undertaking understood to have been given by the German Consul - General in Sydney, to the then Commonwealth 
I entirely approve of the course the Prime Minister proposes to take, and my objection to his attitude in the first instance arose from the impression that he intended to give us nothing more than a mere explanation.

* which induced the company to employ black labour % Honorable members will understand, when they hear his statement, that the companies have a stronger objection to the **British** seaman than that he costs a little more than the Iascar.

* We pay 75,000 a year, and the **British** Government pays 90,000, so that 165,000 is the total amount paid, and that expenditure is divided between the **British** and Australian Governments.

* Another reason is that they decline to discriminate between the various descriptions of **British** subjects.

* The proposal to give preference to **British** oil caps the edifice.

* The **British** Government today are advancing 100,000,000 to the Irish people, and are offering a 12 per cent.

* If our 3 per cent, stocks were boomed they would become popular, and we should not object to some one else obtaining a benefit, not at our cost, but at the cost of the **British** public.

* Therefore it is very seldom in the political history of our country, or of any country within the **British** Empire, that we find men associated in a Government finding it necessary to separate from one another.

* It is the foundation of liberty, as we understand it in **British** countries.

* If we do not believe in the cardinal principle that no one shall take from a man that which he has lawfully obtained- 
The work of gradually returning to their homes the Pacific islanders, formerly employed, has proceeded without friction or hardship, owing largely to the co-operation of the **British** officials in the Solomons and New Hebrides with the Queensland officers temporarily transferred to the Commonwealth service in connexion with this undertaking.

* We are providing for a preference to the **British** manufacturers of certain goods, and for the owners of **British** ships who convey those goods to Australia.

* That being so, we ought to grant preferential treatment to **British** seamen.

* I would point out, however, that we could only hope to adopt such a course when granting a preference to all **British** imports.

* If the Bill provided for a preference to all **British** imports by a percentage increase in the duties on all goods from foreign countries, the amendment would be applicable: but since the Bill relates only to a small proportion of **British** imports, I think that it would be a mistake to accept it.

* The Government have received no information as to whether any other action has been taken to carry out the objects of the Convention, but gather from press notices that in addition to  Mr. Merton  King, who is acting in place of Captain Rason as  Deputy  Resident **British** Commissioner, the ^**British** Government have appointed Captain Harrowel to take charge of a force of police.

* Obviously this will give him great advantage, unless **British** representative is appointed at once, and has equal opportunities."

* On the 16th a reply was received that the appointment of the **British** Judge would be made as soon as possible, and a despatch of the I 8tt confirming that statement added that when the appointment was made  His  Majesty's Government would " carefully consider the suggestion of your Ministers that he should familiarize himself with the local circumstances of the New Hebrides before the Joint Court' enters upon its functions."

* No doubt politics at times bring men into strange company, and I listened with some amusement to the arguments of honorable members opposite in favour of the preferential treatment of **British** goods.

* He went on to say that some of our staple products - he gave two instances - are sold in the **British** markets at prices lower than they bring here.

* In the first place, he said that no **British** Legislature possessed the closure without '.limitations which were absent from this proposal.

* Anything that is absent from this proposal, so far as it is comparable with the closure rules of other **British** Legislatures, is all in favour of the minority, so far as this House is concerned.

* Does not the honorable member know that the application of the closure is subject to the consent of the  Speaker  only in the **British** House of Commons ?

* One misstatement on the part of the honorable member for Parramatta of which I complain is his assertion that this proposal is more dras tic than any that has been adopted in any other Legislature in the **British** dominions.

* Our first rule provides that where the standing orders are not very clear or distinct, we  may  resort to the practice of the **British** House of Commons.

* I find that the practice in the **British** House of Commons, in the State of Victoria, and also in the State of South Australia has been to permit a non-official member to move for the increase of a tax.

* It was intended to take advantage of the offer of the **British** Consul at Chicago  (Mr. Alexander Finn)  to have full information about Australia made available, to answer inquiries in regard to this country ; and to advertise by displaying maps, distributing pamphlets, and, if possible, showing samples of the produce and resources of this country.'

* The **British** Consul, who has on several occasion* kindly placed his services at the disposal of this Department, has offered,, with his Vice-Consul.

* Unfortunately, Imperial Governments, for the most part, belong to the Manchester school, and they push their free-trade views to such an extent, that they are not prepared to defend **British** authors and publishers.

* As soon as the American authors found that, as a result of a policy of retaliation on the part of the **British** and Commonwealth Governments, they were losing a large circle of readers, I think that our own authors would soon secure redress.

* Copyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is a **British** subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in Australia.

* An American author will only be entitled to copyright in Great Britain upon complying with the same conditions as a **British**, subject.

* He must, therefore, publish simultaneously in Great Britain or her Possessions on the one hand, and in the  United  States on the other hand, and he must register at Stationers' Hall and deposit the necessary copies of his work where this would be required from  a  **British** author.

* Those are some of the American conditions, and I understand that some **British** firms have set up establishments, and are publishing in the United States.

* Mr. CROUCH (Corio).- Sub-clause 2- of clause 13 says that copyright shall subsist -  in every book, whether the author is a **British** subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in Australia.

* I challenge the honorable member for Fremantle to deny that since the **British** Imperial Oil Company began their operations here the price of kerosene oil has been reduced to the people of Australia.

* I am excited because I am surprised to find that when a **British** company - and I do not care if they have behind them all the Rothschilds - are trying to fight the biggest Trust in the world - an octopus which has its tentacles on the trade and commerce of Australia - honorable members seem inclined to brush on one side their request for a little help to sustain them in an industry which is giving employment to Australians, and to say, " Oh, only two or three wharf laborers will get more work if we remove this duty."

* The oil of the **British** Imperial Oil Company if tested on the table to-night, would produce as brilliant a light without smoke as would the other oil.

* a gallon more for the oil which thev use in the bush bv removing this duty and -so crushing out the **British** company?

* We know that over a third of the members of the House of Commons were returned as opponents of the policy of the **British** Government in connexion with the conduct of the war.

* Arising out of the reply to the question of the honorable "member for Corio, I desire to ask the Prime Minister if any claim has been put forward that there should be a consultation in regard to the appointment of correspondents of the Board of Trade, and if so, does it involve our submitting to a claim, if made, by the **British** Government that" they should be consulted in reference to the appointment of AgentsGeneral ?

* **British** authorities should be consulted in reference to  the  appointment of much more important persons, such as the AgentsGeneral or the High Commissioner ?

* At page 472,  May,  in explaining the practice in the **British** House of Lords, says - 
Who can say that honorable members of this House might not have desired to follow the example of the **British** House of Lords in the case quoted, and put the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill off for another six months?

* I submit that we have a right to claim that what is done in the **British** House of Lords and what is done in the Canadian Parliament, and, further, what is contemplated by the Commonwealth Constitution, shall be done in this case, and that the actual motion required for the passage of the Bill shall follow the motion for its  third reading.

* I would recommend honorable members who have the time to spare to read an article entitled "Trades Unionism and **British** Industries," which appears in the  Worth American Review,  vol.

* They felt the restraint which was put upon them by the law, and the **British** desire for freedom was uppermost.

* Judge, true to the best of our **British** traditions, gave his award in accordance with the evidence that was submitted to him.

* In connexion with another dispute - and I regret that I have not been able to obtain a copy of the New Zealand newspaper containing the full details of the case - one of the workers, in the course of a speech delivered at the Trades Council of New Zealand, said - 
I have before stated that so long as we have **British** Judges we shall have justice meted out, but I am afraid that the Court proposed to be created will be too closely restricted in its decisions by the provisionsof the Bill.

* But when we declare our powers, privileges, and immunities, we shall probably find that the powers of the **British** House of Commons have disappeared, because this Parliament is vested with those powers only until we declare our powers, privileges, and immunities.

* The final clause of the Bill also states - 
One of the greatest privileges enjoyed by **British** subjects is the right to petition Parliament, and I feel that that right would be abused if we allowed such a proceeding as has taken place this afternoon to be repeated.

* c. 13 - the prohibition of the influx of labourers under contract is restricted to " aliens and foreigners," and does not apply to **British** subjects?

* I would remind the honorable member for Hindmarsh that in connexion with the **British** Army men have been put into the ranks for a day in order that advantage might be taken of the rankers' section with regard to promotions.

* Men who have been working hard on the guns or performing other similar duties are now asked to pass an examination in English, which is quite proper, and also in the following - 
That statement is all very well, but we are a **British** community, and are not inclined to adopt the extreme measure of prohibition in amatter of this kind.

* It would be a bad thing in many ways if we shut out the best people of Europe from the shores of the Commonwealth, because they are not only good citizens, but they give a blending of the best qualities which have done so much to make the **British** nation what it is.

* If the education test be excluded, which is objected to so strongly as deceptive, it would be difficult to prove that an intending immigrant was a native of Africa or Asia, and although I dislike the elusive principles of the measure, I still more dislike the only alternative, namely, that we should put the **British** Government in a position in which it has stated it does not desire to be placed.

* It is all very well for members to say we cannot embarrass the **British** Government by passing a measure stating directly how aliens are to be excluded, but surely the **British** Government is the best judge.

* Surely the Prime Minister and the AttorneyGeneral who have lately been in communication personally with the **British** Government, are able to say whether that is the opinion of the home authorities.

* The **British** Government, while accepting those small measures, might be embarrassed in accepting a Bill keeping out certain races from Australia.

* Are we not part of the **British** Empire?

* A statement was made in the press that a party had been formed, the main object of which was to flout the **British** Government.

* We have a right to give every consideration to the difficulties of the **British** Government, and only when our claims are infinitely more vital than those of any other part of the **British** Empire have we the right to insist that those claims shall be settled, and settled in the way we desire.

* If it is found by the **British** Government that we are unable to do that which we desire by taking the course they wish us to take ; if our vital claims are not met by the legislation that we pass in accordance with their wishes, I am as sure of this as any one can be sure of the future - sure of it on the history of the past - that the **British** Government will never in such circumstances refuse to Australia what is necessary and desirable for its national life.

* I think, therefore, that in the first place we might try to extend that consideration to the **British** Government which they have asked.

* The experience of that period would be sufficient to show whether the measure had effected its purpose or whether we need then go to the **British** Government and demand what the honorable member for Bland proposes to move for.

* The fear is expressed by some honorable members that if we accept this measure definitely the **British** Government will be more reluctant to alter it, and that our own Parliament may settle down to the acceptance of the Bill, whether it is successful or not.

* If our experience showed the necessity for such a change, I am sure the **British** Government would not refuse it.

* I was rather surprised at the lightness with which the honorable member for West Sydney seemed to view the embarrassment of the **British** Government.

* But the total quantity of **British** and foreign bacon and hams imported into Western Australia last year, under a duty of 2d., was 20,123 lbs.

* can be expected to reduce the amount to 62 
But the figures I have quoted refer to **British** and foreign produce only - they have no application to Australasian produce.

* But the figures I have given are based on **British** and foreign produce, apart altogether from Australasian produce.

* I might go a little further and say that a great deal of the Victorian incomes belong to Great Britain ; and when honorable members talk about the great losses of Victoria when the boom burst, I might say that the loss of Victorians was nothing compared with that of the **British** investor.

* And I unhesitatingly declare that in spite of his protection - perhapsbecause of it - his condition is immeasurably worse than that of the **British** worker.

* It is more difficult here, beset as the Commonwealth is with greater dangers and difficulties in regard to the future life and preservation of white occupation, than exist in any part of the **British** Dominions.

* Why not sit down and be quite comfortable, seeing that we have the **British** Navy to depend upon?"

* When one asks them why they depend on the **British** Navy, the reply is, " See the magnificent Leviathans the ships are; their guns; the speed of the vessels."

* It is incumbent upon those who value the **British** Navy because of the training and competence of the men who compose it to show that an army fit to do its work can possibly be obtained in Australia without preliminary training.

* -Has the Prime Minister seen the report in to-day's  Argus  regarding the complaints of **British** settlers in the  New Hebrides, and is he able to give the House any information as to the actual state of affairs there?

* The lagging behind in the commercial race which now characterizes the great **British** Empire is due to the cursed system of caste, rank, privilege, and title to which her people adhere.

* But the **British** Admiralty do not wish to create a system in these waters which would obstruct the formation of an independent Australian Navy.

* The leader of the Opposition struck the only weak point in the armour of the agreement when he pointed out that under the existing arrangement, the **British** Government guaranteed that the strength of the **British** fleet in these waters - apart from the vessels of the Auxiliary Squadron - should not be decreased.

* But in  view of  the fact that they propose to double the present strength of the fleet in these waters, and that the contribution of 200,000 per annum will not represent 1 percent, of the annual expenditure on the **British** Navy, I think that during this period in our early Commonwealth life, at all events, it would be preposterous for us to dictate to the Imperial authorities.

* There has been nothing to create suspicion in any act of the **British** Govern-, ment towards this country.

* If any honorable member could give us an instance of anything in the nature of a tyrannical action, or of anything like suspicion on the part of the **British** Government with regard to us, then he might perhaps be fearful of the present proposal.

* It is-nonsense to speak of the principles of the **British** Constitution in this connexion.

* **British** people are not such fools as to carry logic to an absurdity in dealing with practical questions of this kind.

* An objection has been raised to the proposal on the ground that the **British** authorities will have power to remove the fleet from Australian waters, but, if there is anything in the Blue Book which has been placed in our hands with which every **British** subject can agree, it is the statement; that when we go to war our navy cannot act on the defensive.

* In our position in regard to the foundation of the Commonwealth, we should recollect that the process of evolution in connexion with our relations with the **British** Empire should be very slow, and I consider that this period of ten years will be of great advantage to us in giving us leisure to consider the whole question of exterior lines of defence.

* But the establishment of such a force will not affect the worldwide defence of **British** commerce.

* I believe that the **British** Government have acted most generously and magnanimously to us in regard to it.

* I hope, however, that we shall never lose the protection of the **British** Navy, and the right to call ourselves **British** citizens.

* If that is the law of responsibility in regard to industrial troubles, it cannot be said that the statement of the honorable member for Parramatta, that **British** law never punishes the innocent, is borne out by facts.

* I mentioned the case to refute the honorable member's statement that **British** justice never punishes the innocent.

* When one talks about Australia people are disposed' to turn the cold shoulder to him and to inquire : " Do you belong to the **British** Empire at all?

* In connexion with this memorandum, we cannot refrain from expressing our conviction that, although a reasonable provision against the importation of labour during a strike could be fully vindicated, the real aims of the Commonwealth will not be understood or sympathized with, so long as constantly recurring incidents under the contract sections serve to remind, people of the provision which grates upon every **British** susceptibility, by treating the **British** worker under contract as an industrial " pariah " in a **British** community.

* The Glasgow correspondent of  Engineering,  writing at the early part of November, says - " Steel rails continue to be very much depressed, most of the export orders being absorbed by the American mills at prices which **British** manufacturers cannot at present touch.

* Our inquiry has shown (1) that the iron and steel industry of this country has declined relatively to that of other countries; (2) that our export trade to foreign countries has diminished, while that to the colonies has  increased;  (3) that, although our trade with the colonies has increased, the colonial market is increasing much more rapidly, and that foreign countries are securing a growing proportion of this colonial trade ; (4) that the relative decline of the **British** iron and steel industry is not due to any natural **British** disadvantages, or want of skill and enterprise on the part either of **British** manufacturers or of **British** workmen ; (5) that it is due to the fact that the manufacturers of the United States and Germany, having secured control of their home markets by means of high tariffs and an organized system for the regulation of their export trade, are in a position to dump their surplus products upon the **British** and other markets, irrespective of cost; (6) that the practice of dumping could not be carried on by foreign countries but for the **British** system of free imports.

* The article points out that the **British** system of free imports is bound to induce dumping; and the protection such as this Bill proposes to give, would encourage a better system, and afford that protection to which the industry is entitled.

* A mere motion for the adjournment of the House will not suffice; whether or not this Parliament be compelled to take action, it is absolutely certain that the next Parliament will have to do something, in view of the present proportion between the foreign and the **British** influx.

* Apparently they did not care whether or not the machinery was foreign made, though the **British** artisans in my electorate 
The honorable member for Fremantle and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie said they were Protectionists, but, when it came to mining machinery, they were satisfied with a duty of  7.2^  per cent.

* They had no concern for **British** mechanics employed here, though it is a peculiar feature of the trade that those who build machines are either Australian born or distinctly of **British** descent.

* The honorable member forKalgoorlie has, apparently, awakened to the fact that foreigners are displacing Australian and **British** labour, and I agree with him that that should not be so.

* High Commissioner, and, with him, proper officers to place the advantages and attractions of Australia before the **British** community.

* We desire immigrants, but we desire them mainly of **British** birth.

* Italians and Austrians will work under more slavish conditions than will **British** mechanics.

* The **British** workman is accustomed to afreer atmosphere.

* In London itself there are thousands of destitute foreigners from the centre of Europe who pour intoGreat Britain to compete with **British** workmen.

* It appears that at present in the timber industry of Western Australia out of every 1,000 employes 900 are foreigners and only 100 of **British** descent or Australian born.

* But there is certainly something seriously wrong in regard to our immigration policy if we neglect to afford facilities for **British** people to come here in preference to foreigners.

* The words I complain of in the report are, "inspired by the **British** Medical Association," as they occur in the following connexion :  - 
It appears that before the last election a Brisbane paper published a statement inspired by the **British** Medical Association, that  Mr. Culpin  had once advised the Association to insist on a payment of 25s.

* There is no reason to believe that the libellous paragraph which appeared in the Brisbane  Telegraph  was inspired by the **British** Medical Association.

* The final apology of that newspaper contained a passage which was a misrepresentation of a motion which was attached by it to my name, but which was really indorsed by the **British** Medical Association three years ago.

* Let me, in the interests of labour, remind the honorable member of what is transpiring at the present time in a sister State of the **British** community.

* We are told that the Empire is one, and that therefore her fleet should be one ; that Australia's safety in time of w'ar would depend not on the ability of the Commonwealth to defend itself, .but on  the supremacy of the **British** Navy.

* Lord Selborne put the position thus : - 
There is no possibility of the localization of naval force., and the problem of the **British** Empire is in no sense one of local defence.

* The sea is all one, and the **British** Navy must therefore be all one ; and its solitary task in war must be to seek out the ships of the enemy wherever they are to be found and destroy them.

* The London  Times  indorsed this view, and expressed the opinion that the Australian notion as to the kind of danger to which Australia is peculiarly liable is all an illusion ; in fact, that it is unthinkable that any hostile cruisers would descend upon our shipping or our ports unless the fleet from which they were detached had first defeated the **British** Navy and obtained command of the sea.

* Whether his attention has been directed to a judgment recently delivered in Canada by  Mr. Justice  Anglin to the e'ffect that no **British** Colony could exercise extra-territorial rights with regard to the expatriation of aliens without direct authority from the Imperial Parliament?

* Where it is made to appear to the GovernorGeneral that any part of the **British** Dominions has made satisfactory provision for the protection in that part of the copyright in books, the performing right in musical or dramatic Works, or the copyright in artistic works, first published, performed, or made in Australia, the GovernorGeneral may, by order, declare that all or any of the provisions of this Act shall, subject to such modifications and conditions as he sees fit to direct, apply to the copyright in books, the performing right in musical or dramatic works, or the copyright in artistic works, first published or performed or made in that part of the **British** Dominions : 
Provided that the period of protection in Australia shall not exceed the period of protection in that part of the **British** Dominions or the period of protection under this Act.

* That is intended to give effect by enactment to legislation which may be passed in any other part of the **British** Dominions.

* The return shows that strawboard of undeniably foreign manufacture has been brought into Australia as **British**.

* Having had a most important division on bicycle handlebars, we are now contending on the question of strawboard, which cannot prove of any very great importance as a matter of preference to **British** manufacturers.

* The Minister has introduced a schedule which proposes **British** preference, but there is no **British** industry which could be preferred under this item; therefore, a much more serious question arises.

* .- This Chamber and the Senate have indorsed the principle that **British** goods shall not be entitled to a preference unless they are imported direct in **British** ships manned exclusively by white sailors.

* In the first place, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie sought to insert a provision that the ships carrying **British** preference goods should be manned exclusively by white **British** seamen.

* The honorable and learned member for West Sydney then proposed that 80 per cent, of the crews of the ships referred to should be white **British** seamen.

* At page 3521 of  Hansard  he is reported to have said :  - 
The honorable member for Kalgoorlie then moved that the ships should be manned exclusively by white seamen - not white **British** seamen - from which it appears that this House is more anxious about white foreigners that white Britishers !

* I. do not intend to discuss at this moment the subject of boycotting, because the provisions of our criminal and civil law are ample to repress it, and numerous instances are to be found in America, in England, and in other **British** communities, in which the courts have repressed it.

* But now he is root in favour of local option ; he does not believe in this grand ideal of **British** justice, which he said, in, very eloquent terms, was practically the means of losing the American Colonies to Great Britain?

* I say unhesitatingly that one of the principal reasons why the Government have proposed this new clause, and why the missionaries in **British** New Guinea have advocated some other method than prohibition, is that they fear additional taxation.

* We have no more right to coerce them than they have to coerce the natives of **British** New 'Guinea to the number of about 500,000.

* Another consideration is that those who are prepared to give the white people in **British** New.

* That all the words after the word " officers," line 1 , he omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "duly appointed and all male inhabitants (excepting those who are exempted as hereinafter provided) who have resided in the Commonwealth for Six months and are **British** subjects, and are between the ages of eighteen and 2.1 years.

* The Minister has power to call upon every male inhabitant of Australia except those who are exempt from service - that is, those who are already in the defence forces - and who have resided for six months in the Commonwealth and are **British** subjects, and who are between the ages of 18 and 60, to serve in the militia.

* I desire to call the attention of the Committee to the fact that the standard for the **British** Army has been continuously lowered, and that although it is lowered now to an extent which we used to regard as almost farcical, it is still very difficult to obtain a sufficient number of suitable recruits.

* The **British** Legislature has no power to take any such action.

* Surely they have the same right to be cut off from the **British** Parliament as have the people of Ireland.

* We know that for many years the subject of Home Rule for Ireland has been a burning one in **British** politics.

* It has been implied that if Home Rule be not granted to Ireland the  people  of that country will break  away  from the **British** Empire.

* We mint our own gold coinage - from which a loss is made - whilst the **British** Government is securing the profit derived from the coinage of our silver.

* In the meantime, our silver coinage is being minted in England, and the **British** Government is making a profit that should really be secured by the Commonwealth.

* The reason for my submitting the proposal at all is that some cases have come under my notice where an application has been made to get a refund of the extra duty on **British** goods which have arrived in foreign bottoms.

* Where, through no wilfulness, but simply through ignorance of what has taken place, merchants have brought **British** goods to Australia, or had them shipped before they were able to communicate, those goods should not.

* I think that we ought not to charge the additional duty on **British** goods in such circumstances.

* My proposal is to protect **British** goods which were afloat in foreign bottoms before this motion was submitted.

* Personally, I should have liked to see the communication directed to the **British** Government, believing that possibly that course might have proved a more effective form of remonstrance ; and the representations made by the Prime Minister of New Zealand had, in  my view, sufficient force behind them to justify that step.

* that we have no right to interfere with the affairs of another portion of the **British** Empire; in fact, some people go so far as to say that action of that sort may have a reflex effect,, and possibly injure ourselves in some contingency of the future.

* Although there may always be doubts as to the propriety of taking action in any particular instance - doubts as to whether the circumstances are serious enough to warrant our interference, or assistance being offered by us - there does not seem any possibility of doubt as to the general responsibility we hold as an integral portion of the **British** community.

* Therefore, I think that we have some right to express our views, and, if necessary, represent those views to the **British** Government.

* It has been said that if we once admit the propriety of any portion of the Empire interfering in the concerns of another, we in Australia may render ourselves liable to a protest being made by some portion of the **British** community against any action of ours, and in this we may hamper our independence.

* But we in Australia have been granted by the **British** Government the right to control our own affairs, in that we have the fullest measure of self-government ; and whatever course may be decided on in the government of the Commonwealth, it is fairly reasonable to assume has behind it the united weight of the people of Australia.

* When trouble occurred between the Boer Government and the **British** authorities in the Transvaal, we were told by  Mr. Chamberlain  and those associated with him, that the sole concern of the Imperial Government was the welfare of the Uitlanders, and a desire to see justice done to people who had gone to South Africa, and who, while endeavouring to develop the country were being subjected to conditions utterly inconsistent with freedom.

* We were told that it was essential to counteract in some way the Boer conspiracy, which had for its object the driving of the **British** people out of South Africa.

* Yet, after all this grave anxiety for the welfare of the Uitlanders, we now find an endeavour being made by the deputies of the Imperial Government, and assented to, so far as the principle is concerned, by the Imperial Government, to drive the **British** out of South Africa, or, at any rate, out of, the Transvaal.

* The **British** Government, it seems to me, are taking a step which must inevitably result in driving all the white proletariat, at all events, out of the Transvaal.

* But from the stand-point of the future of the country, and the welfare of the **British** race, how will it serve the turn of the **British** people to have an oligarchy of mine-owners, reaping dividends running up to 180 per cent, on boom flotations - that is to say, on nominal capital, out of all proportion to the actual amount spent in the development of the mines ?

* When we find the mine-owners reaping rewards of that magnitude, I ask the question: how is it going to serve the turn of the **British** Empire to have the Transvaal' inhabited by a few individuals, the largest proportion .

* of them foreigners in every respect so far as concerns **British** blood and sentiment, and by a large body of servile .people?

* I maintain that that cannot be of any advantage from the standpoint of the advancement of the .**British** Empire.

* Bleloch, in an excellent work  recently published -  The New South Africa  - points out that the only manner in which  the Transvaal can be kept permanently in touch, in sentiment, with the people of Great Britain, is to insure that **British** immigrants shall be encouraged to go there.

* Surely, we, in Australia, shall be better able to attend to the affairs of our own corner of the Empire, if we are free from any anxiety as to what is likely to occur in any distant portion of the territories that go to make up the sphere of **British** influence.

* But it seems to me that so far as the cost of living is concerned, the remedy is largely within the authority of the **British** Government themselves.

* mines, than the whole of the losses of the **British** forces during the war, either from bullet or disease.

* After the war the mine-owners evidently thought that, as a large number of natives had been employed as carriers and in other capacities by the **British** authorities, and were suddenly discharged, they would obtain their services almost without payment.

* When we remember that the South African Labour Commission was appointed solely at the instance of the Chamber of Mines, that twenty out of the twenty-three witnesses examined were members of the Chamber, that nearly all the commissioners were members of that body, and that the Chamber is controlled by two or three large mine-owners who are not solely interested in **British** securities, but whose headquarters are in some cases outside of Great Britain, we can easily understand the justification for  Mr. Creswell's  complaint that the evidence of mine-owners who have tried white labour and found it successful was not allowed to come out.

* A formal protest, signed by fourteen of the leaders of the Boers, was sent to the **British** Government against the introduction of the Chinese.

* It is" true that we have no power; but it is certainly a novel suggestion that the views of a large section of the people in a **British** community are to go for nothing; that when they protest against an improper condition of affairs, their protests are to be disregarded.

* South- Africa and of the nation as a whole, that we should leave no stone unturned to prevent what, in my opinion, would be a calamity to **British** interests - the introduction of Chinese labour into the Transvaal.

* We were told that the Commonwealth Parliament would endeavour to secure that which' all true postal reformers desire - uniform postage, not only in Australia, but throughout the **British** Dominions.

* John Jacob, in his  Annals of **British** Norman Isles,  published in 1830 bv Simpkins and Marshall, London, and A. and W.  Galignani,  Paris, tells us - 
In New South Wales the number of voters has increased by 28,900.

* In the year 1906-7 the **British** revenue was 31,000,000 from this source, and there is the super tax above that.

* By what name is the **British** people known throughout the .world?

* The Saxons, I say, are pure Germans, and the best traits in the **British** peoples come from their Saxon blood.

* It is to the splendid fighting instinct which we Australians have derived with our **British** blood, that we owe the liberties which we have; we do not owe them to the example of the Old Country, with her limited franchise and abominable land laws.

* Speaking of what the honorable member for Darwin describes as our "gilt-spurred roosters," the honorable member said - 
**British** labour members of the LP.

* The address denounces the attempt by the press to stir up war between Britain and Germany, and was followed by a resolution pledging **British** and German  workingmen  to work together for peace.

* But to borrow , 3,500,000 from the **British** money lender, and spend it on the construction of ships in **British** yards is simply perpetuating the old order of things and piling up debt, with no advantage to Australia either immediate or remote.

* At the same time, it is demanded of the **British** taxpayers that they shall contribute to the cost of the defence of the trade of the Empire.

* I know that she is, and do not think that the **British** Govern ment will ever shirk their responsibility in this respect.

* The party to which I belong rightly told the **British** Government that, in the event of war, the entire resources of Australia would be at their disposal ; but, notwithstanding what the Prime Minister and other members of the Government have said, I fear that not only our Inter-State trade, but our trade with the adjacent islands, and, indeed, with America, would be left unprotected on the outbreak of hostilities.

* as under international' law there is only one executive authority in the **British** Empire capable of being recognised by foreign States, Colonial ships of war cannot operate independently of the Royal Navy except to the limited extent referred to above.

* The Executive power of the Crown, as the central authority of the **British** Empire, must be applied as regards foreigners in the same manner and under the same conditions wherever a military or naval force is in existence, and the same responsibility for any action taken by Colonial or Home ships of war will rest upon this central authority.

* To me it is astonishing to find that men who profess to be democrats should, the moment the opportunity presents itself, desire to become autocrats, and to go even further than the Conservatives have ever gone in any **British** Parliament.

* These proposals, added to our existing Standing Orders, will form a code of rules which exceed in severity those which are operative in any **British** Parliament.

* Will he name any other **British** Parliament in which more severe Standing Orders obtain?

* Therefore the honorable member must see that my statement that these proposals, in conjunction with our present Standing Orders, are more severe than the rules which obtain in any other **British** Parliament is correct.

* The honorable member is alluding to a practice which exists, not only in the Queensland Parliament, but in the **British** Parliament - the practice of fixing a time at which the debate upon a measure shall conclude.

* 1 remind the honorable member that this is really a codification, on **British** lines, of the law which has been in existence in the States.

* I suggest that a man who is passing an examination corresponding to that of "Tactical fitness .to command" in the  **British** Service might well have all the library and conveniences of a Military College at his disposal whilst he does it.

* I am prepared to vote for an agreement, and tentatively to rely for the coastal protection of Australia on the **British** Navy, as against the immediate creation, at great expense, of an Australian Navy.

* In those circumstances we should feel it our .bounden duty - whether by the effective partnership of the Australian Squadron with the **British** fleet, or by some other arrangement with the Admiralty - to pay some regard to the general interests of the Empire.

* But, in view of our circumstances at the present time, I do not think that we are called upon to do more than to assist the Empire by providing for the security of Australia, and by making the naval bases here impregnable, so that they may be of assistance to the **British** fleet in general.

* recently been, put forward by the **British** Navy League, that out of a total of some 13,000 per annum, voted on last year's Estimates for the Intelligence Department of the Navy, only some 4,000 was actually used for the actual  maintenance of the Intelligence  branch.

* It has been said that no **British** Admiral worth his salt would hesitate to break any agreement if in his judgment the necessities of the situation warranted him in doing so.

* If it were merely a matter of going a few miles beyond the limits of the station, it is probable that any **British** or Australian Admiral would break an agreement to that extent to meet or to pursue the enemy's ships ; but an Admiral would be less likely to take the fleet away on small provocation if the agreement contained an express prohibition against his taking it away at all.

* It could not be said that there was any **British** fleet in existence at that time.. Nominally the fleet was at  home, but actually it did not exist, because the' vessels were unrigged and without crews.

* If it becomes necessary to concentrate the forces of the **British** Navy, no doubt that should be done, but under the agreement .we should endeavour to provide primarily for the defence of -Australia.

* I find that the machinery used in the Victorian woollen mills is admitted duty free, whereas machinery imported into Queensland for wool washing is charged 20 per cent, in the case of **British** machinery, and 25 per cent, in the case of foreign machinery.

* I am with those who are willing, if necessary, to expend ,500,000 in order to make manifest to the **British** people the merits of this country.

* Whether his attention has been called to a. telegram in the  Age,  of the 2nd instant, stating that the High Courthad delivered judgment in the case of  Strachan  v.  the Commonwealth of Australia,  in whichplaintiff was non-suiterf on the plea that the Commonwealth was not responsible for acts committed by **British** New Guinea officials?

* Is it proposed to bring **British** New Guinea under Commonwealth control; and, if so, when is it proposed to take the necessary action to this end?

* Parliament has not voted the salaries of **British** New Guinea officials.

* The fact that the Commonwealth  was  not legally liable for the actions of **British** New Guinea officials has always been known.

* We should respect contracts which have been entered into by our citizens for the purchase of foreign goods, just as much as we respect such contracts for the purchase of **British** goods.

* The proposal before the Committee, however, covers only **British** goods shipped in foreign vessels.

* I am not in accord with all the details of the proposals of the Government, though I am in favour of extending a preference to **British** goods, and, if possible, to **British** bottoms.

* 1 do not wish to be charged with slavishly following the opinion of a particular newspaper when 1 express the opinion that we should take care to so frame this Bill that it will not be possible for our shores to be left, at the will of the **British** Admiral on the Australian station, without the protection of at least &amp; proportion of our fleet.

* If in time of war one or two vessels of the enemy succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the **British** Navy they could make a raid on our coasts, shell many of our coastal towns and cities, and do immense damage.

* Let me say, at the same time, that I' am fully in agreement with the statement made by my leader on behalf of the late Government, that at all times the resources of the Commonwealth are at the disposal of the **British** Government.

* Australians have lately had an opportunity to be trained in the **British** Navy, and we know of local men who entered that Navy without assistance.

* In Victoria, notwithstanding that it has been insisted that only Australian or **British** materials, shall be used by Government Departments, German brushware has been purchased by them, and we have heard of Federal Departments using imported materials when equally good Australian manufactures were available.

* The passage which the Attorney-General has read explains some of the **British** provisions which have applied only since 1875.

* He has made no such provision as that contained in the **British** law in reference to trade marks in use before the Bill comes into operation.

* I think that an address within the **British** Empire ought to be sufficient.

* Even the advocates of preferential trade have consoled themselves with the fact that whilst the exports of **British** manufactures to foreign countries have been steadily declining, those of the **British** Possessions have increased, and partly compensated for the loss.

* Quoting again from  Mr. Chamberlain,  I find that he said - 
The manifesto published in the  Age  of yesterday, signed by a large number of pro-preference **British** trades unionists, sent to  Mr. Watson,  leader of thi Federal Labour Party, in opposition to the anti-preference  declarations of Messrs. John Burns, Richard Bell, and Ramsay McDonald, was considered yesterday by the Iabour Party caucus.

* Gratification was  expressed  that  the  **British** unionists who favoured M/.

* Is it not bordering upon hypocrisy to blazon it forth to the world that because a majority of honorable members are in favour of granting a preference to **British** goods, they are willing to grant the preference which is asked for in England today ?

* No doubt, as the result of a combination of those who are in favour of granting preference to **British** goods, by way of a reduction of the duties which exist to-day on revenue lines, and of those who would grant it by increasing the present duties as against the foreigner, we should have a majority in favour of the motion.

* the **British** dependencies the burdens of Empire.

* I do not know, however, that there is any cause for alarm as to ih&lt; Keeling which the people of any part of the **British** Possessions entertain for Great Britain.

* I take this opportunity to deprecate the way in which  Mr. Chamberlain  has placed the question before **British** audiences.

* Statistics of to-day tell the tale of the German workers' rye bread, of the scanty wage, and the fact that the Imperial Bureau figures show that in 1901  there were slaughtered in Germany for human consumption 78,000 horses, comes as a warning to the **British** workers of what may be their fate if once they surrender the principle of untaxed bread and meat.

* At present, like most of our exports, wool is admitted free; but, should the **British** Empire differentiate against foreign products, a duty may be imposed.

* The Minister of Trade and Customs last evening, in speaking of **British** and other imports, fell into a similar error.

* In 1897 she gave a pre ference of 12^ per cent, to **British** goods, in the following year she increased that preference to 25 per cent., and in July, I9Q3&gt; to 33$ per cent.

* I have here a table by Lord Farrer, .dealing with the imports into Canada, both before and after the adoption of the **British** Preference Tariff.

* The average for the five years 1893-97 was 7,308,000, while the imports in 1901 - after the **British** Preferential Tariff were 8,962,000, or an increase of 1,654,000.

* The table deals with the returns from 1870 until 1902, the object of it being to show that **British** trade is practically holding its own, notwithstanding the advantages possessed by that of other nations.

* The return gives Great Britain's exports to **British** North- America, **British** West Indies.

* Australian Colonies, India, South Africa,- and other **British** Possessions, and it shows that for the five years ending 1870 the total percentage was 23"o.

* should be able to grant a preference to **British** manufacturers.

* That is one of the lines on which a preference might be given with advantage to the **British** manufacture.

* A balance of 4,000,000 would go into the pockets of the **British** landlords.

* But the writer from whose work I have taken these figures says - 
In 1902, there were imported into England 27,000,000 worth of wheat, of which **British** Dependencies supplied only 7,500,000 worth.

* Canada would benefit to a greater extent than Australia or any other **British** dependency, it being estimated that she would receive 50 per cent, of the benefit, while New Zealand would obtain 30 per cent., and Australia 20 per cent.

* Mr. Chamberlain's  idea was that if the **British** public allowed themselves to be taxed, and paid more for their food, they should as a set-off be granted old-age pensions.

* What hypocrisy it is then for us to say that we are prepared to make concessions to **British** manufacturers.

* What I say is that the "303 Lee-Enfield rifle is the most desirable of those in use by the **British** Government at the present time.

* I believe some improvement is suggested in the sighting of the Lee-Enfield rifle ; but it is a high-class weapon, and any improvement by **British** experts is likely to be very slight.

* The report of the **British** Commission appointed to inquire into the conduct of the South African war, particulars of which are published in the press today, is an illustration of what would result from such a short-sighted policy.

* I would call the attention of the Treasurer to the following paragraph which appears in to-day's issue of a Melbourne journal : - 
It is perfectly evident from the action taken that the authorities of the **British** War Office have not thought so, because they have armed their forces with the Lee-Enfield rifles.

* In other words, it means that the people of Papua may have prohibition if they so desire; but it is no part of the duty of this Parliament to dictate liquor laws to the 500 Europeans in **British** New Guinea.

* I do not believe that the Gothenburg system could yet be successfully established in **British** New Guinea.

* a considerable amount of illicit distillation in **British** New Guinea.

* If there is illicit distillation, smuggling, and illicit trading, in addition to the consumption as to which we have information, the quantity of liquor drunk in **British** New Guinea must be enormous.

* The Prime Minister has introduced an innovation amongst **British** people in this respect.

* In view of the statement in this morning's  Ace,  that the Orient Steamship Company is a member of the **British** shipping ring, will the Prime Minister at once abrogate the postal contract, under which it is subsidized bv the Commonwealth, unless he receives a guaran-tee that it will withdraw from the ring which is now attempting to destroy **British** trade with Australia?

* The honorable gentleman has referred us to the **British** and South Australian Acts, and, as has been pointed out, he has quoted the provisions of those Acts in such a way as to lead to a misapprehension as to their effect.

* When he made his first explanation, the honorable gentleman said that these words were taken from the **British** Act.

* I do not remember the exact words which the honorable gentleman used, but the meaning he intended to convey was that the words "contained in this clause were the same in effect as the words contained in the **British** provision.

* We should have no objection if the Minister is willing to adopt the words of the **British** or South Australian Acts.

* Unquestionably, in view of the fact that he has pointed out that this Bill is modelled on the **British** Act, and he proposed to quote from that Act to show how nearly alike the provisions were.

* If the honorable gentleman believes that this clause should have the same meaning as the **British** provision he can have no reasonable objection to substituting the words, of the **British** Act, which we think are better, and more clearly define what is intended.

* Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta).- I suggest that the honorable member for Wentworth might move to strike out' all the words after the word "false," line 38, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the words of the section which the Minister has read from the **British** Act.

* Yes, notwithstanding that their Tariff is lower than ours, the **British** South African Colonies have given an all-round preference of  2^  per cent, to the rest of the Empire - a condition of things to which we declined to subscribe the other day.

* It is far better that we should proceed as other parts of the Empire have done, by granting a simple all-round, reduction of duties on imports f :om the rest of the **British** Empire.

* That Great Britain is in a state of serious apprehension, that she is very much alert, is evident from the fact that ^60,000,000 per annum is paid by the **British** taxpayer for defence purposes.

* John Fortescue, an able writer, and the author of the  History of the **British** Army..

* If there be one lesson to be gleaned from **British** military history, it is the hopeless and irremediable inefficiency of the voluntary system.

* There seems to be an impression that the **British** army is like Xenophon's famous  10,000,  that it is composed of seasoned veterans.

* According to the most recent figures I can obtain,  753  out of every  1,000  in the **British** regular army are of, or under, twenty-five years of age, and since the short service has been in vogue, the average age is less than it was.

* In Younghusband's book,  The Story of the Guides,  he points out one of the great troubles which the **British** forces had to combat there - 
I was about to put that question to the House.

* If honorable members take into consideration our environment, they will recognise that civilization in Australia stands in more danger of absolute destruction than it does in any other part of the **British** Empire.

* .One of the most reputable members of the Opposition is the honorable member for North Sydney, yet, in speaking the other day, he asked, "Why don't we do- as the **British** Navy has done?Conscription has never been necessary in connexion with the **British** Navy.

* Why don't we follow the example of the **British** Admiralty?"

* shortage in connexion with the manning of the **British** Navy, men were hocussed in drinking shops or overpowered in the streets, and sold at the ship's side by the  carcass.

* When we first made this proposal, the charge against us was tha.t it was disloyal ; that it was tantamount to finding fault with the **British** Navy, and the Government have had to meet such questions as, " You have the **British** Navy,  why do you not sit down and do nothing?"

* I have as strong a belief in the **British** Navy, and in Empire responsibility, as has any honorable member, and have shown it whenever called upon to do so ; but, as we all know, man's members either become atrophied or expand, and since my intellect has not become atrophied, I am forced to look at things as  they are.

* I have already said that the **British** -Navy is the greatest fighting  force  in the world, and I want now to present in the briefest manner possible a summary of its history.

* In the middle of the last century the position of the **British** Navy was such that if the whole of the fighting forces afloat of other nations had gathered in the English Channel in opposition to it, it could have blown them out of the water.

* A few decades passed, and we had **British** statesmen saying, not that it could beat the whole world, but that it could Hold its own against any possible combination.

* A little later onand we can trace these changes through history - it was said, " The **British** Navy is able to meet the navies of any two Powers."

* Now we find some of the ablest statesmen in Great Britain declaring that in 1913 the **British** Navy will be put to the pin of her collar to hold her own against one.

* Facts control the situation, and when we find that within fifty years the **British** Navy has passed from the stage of absolute, control of the oceans of the world to one which 'impels some **British** statesmen to declare that it is doubtful whether it will be able in a  little  time hence to hold its own successfully- 
Exactly.

* We must remember that the **British** Navy has something more to do than to look after our shipping and our foreshores.

* The **British** Navy - and I say this is ' an Australian - has as its main responsibility the protection of the heart of the Empire.

* The main work of the **British** Navy is to protect the heart of the Empire - the " powerhouse of the line" - to hold it intact against invasion and to so arrange that the food supplies of Great Britain shall continue without stint.

* Remembering that the **British** Navy has enormous responsibilities, cannot honorable members recognise that we are not disloyal to Britain by trying to prepare to help her in time of trouble, so that when she is engaged in a leviathan struggle, fighting for her life and for the existence of the Empire, we shall not have to throw ourselves upon her shoulders, saying, "Come and help us."

* After that reference to the miners, and after the statement was made that incorrect and misleading advertisements were being published in the **British** press to induce **British** immigrants to come here, then, after careful consideration, the honorable member for Flinders insisted again and again on proof, and classed the statements as ridiculous, absurd, and inaccurate.

* The honorable member asked for proofs that advertisements appeared asking for thousands of miners when no miners were required, and also proof that misleading advertisements were being inserted in the **British** press respecting immigrants.

* That is a general constitutional principle; but it is not customary amongst Ministers and exMinisters in any part of the **British** Empire to say.

* Such proceedings are rare in connexion with **British** Parliaments.

* Every morning some newspaper would announce that the **British** fleet had been seen off Newfoundland, and that **British** troops might be landed upon American soil at any time.

* I would not object, if it were necessary, to a proposal for the foundation of a navy, or - if honorable members thought it better - to entering into a contract with the **British** Government, under which a greater number of Imperial ships would be stationed here to defend Australia, should ft ever become necessary to do so.

* Australia - with its music, sad and thrilling - with its cosy homes, its winters of mildness, and its summers of healthfulness; - where bloom and flourish the finest specimens and virtues of the **British** race, still remains.

* I quite recognise that when the navigation conference meets in London one of the important issues submitted will relate to the fact that there are so many sailors under the **British** flag who are either coloured or are not **British** citizens.

* Unless it can be conclusively proved that sufficient **British** citizens cannot be obtained as seamen on board **British** vessels, it seems to me that there can be very little warrant even for the encouragement of the best seamen of foreign countries, excellent though they may be.

* If they wish to obtain their livelihood upon **British** ships, they ought to become **British** citizens.

* It would involve an inquiry as to the crew of every ship which Carried these particular goods, with a view to discovering whetherall its sailors were **British** citizens.

* But to differentiate duties upon the same goods sent out by **British** ships, because of the non-naturalization of some of the crew, seems to me to be pushing an excellent principle beyond all reason.

* The practice laid down in  May,  and the practice of the **British** Parliament is distinctly to the effect that the only matters which may be discussed in dealing with an Appropriation Bill are those to which it specifically relates.

* Postponing for a few moments some remarks upon certain questions affecting the Commonwealth and other parts of the **British** Empire, and commenting upon a telegram appearing in yesterday's newspapers, I regret to note that it implies an intention of some Premiers of the States not to meet in Conference again this year.

* On several important questions relating to preferential trade, the employment of white seamen on **British** ships, and questions of that nature, I venture to say that  Sir William  Lyne will be a tower of strength.

* The instance to which reference was made arose in connexion with the **British** Preference Bill, and the provision with respect to the employment of white seamen.

* I may say that it is not probable that the advice we shall tender will be of the nature which has been indicated, but it will depend to some extent upon the views held bv the **British** Government on this matter.

* That this Conference recognises that in the present circumstances of the Colonies, it is not practicable to adopt a general system of free trade as between the Mother Country and the **British** Dominions beyond the Seas.

* That the Imperial Government be requested to take the necessary steps for the revision of any commercial treaties which .prevent preferential treatment being accorded to **British** goods carried :n **British** ships.

* That in view of the probable completion of the Panama Canal, it is desirable that all possible means of strengthening **British** interests in the Pacific should be adopted.

* That it is desirableto encourage **British** emigrants to proceed to **British** Colonies rather than foreign countries.

* In every case we have asked that a preference shall be given to **British** citizens.

* Familiar as these may appear to **British** critics in forms and names, they differ often in spirit and in method.

* It is laid down among the obligations of the **British** Empire towards us that the **British** Fleet guarantees Australia against invasion in force, and against attacks by any considerable squadron of armoured vessels ; that, in the third place, the exigencies of war may require the withdrawal of the Australian Imperial Squadron, while, fourthly, Australia cannot be guaranteed against attack by unarmoured commerce raiders up to four in number  but the loss they would inflict would not be of more than secondary importance.

* He said that the **British** Admiralty were not satisfied with the contribution made for the upkeep of the **British** Navy, and that a section of our people were not satisfied with the bargain from our side.

* The Prime Minister having submitted that aspect of the case, the question arises whether the measures which have been outlined by the Government embody such proposals as are likely to be more satisfactory to the **British** naval authorities and to the **British** people themselves than were the conditions previously existing.

* The Prime Minister in his speech went on to say that - 
It was intimated in the clearest terms that so far as the **British** Parliament is concerned it would make no further demands of any kind upon us in connexion with the Imperial Naval defence.

* We have to remember in this connexion, that if Great Britain is to continue to maintain a two-power standard navy, it is absolutely essential that the various parts of the Empire should come together and assist the **British** people to carry the great burden of expenditure which such a policy involves.

* I venture to say that the proposals which have now been made to this House will not be more satisfactory to the **British** people or to the naval authorities.

* The Prime Minister sought to justify his position in these words - 
At the  very  outset of the recent Colonial Conference in London, the Prime Minister of Great Britain met us with a frank avowal that the **British** Government preferred no claim for money in relation to naval defence, and went on to add the extremely pregnant statement that the control of naval defence and foreign affairs must always go together.

* But he ignores the fact that our relationship to the **British** Navy arises from our dependence upon it as our first line of defence, and that we make our contribution, not on account of any foreign policy with which Great Britain may be concerned, but because of the protection which Great Britain is in a position to afford to us.

* In the circumstances we recognise that it is our duty to pay a fair quota towards the maintenance of the **British** Navy.

* Of course, I know that the Prime Minister will argue that, as we have no control over the **British** Navy - that because the ships may be withdrawn to the Indian Ocean or the Bay of Biscay - we are not protected as we should be.

* The Prime Minister said - 
The question is whether we can adopt a different rate of pay from that in the **British** Navy, and still carry out the project which the Prime Minister placed before us.

* That is really a most important question; and the honorable gentleman pointed out that a small navy is bound to be a failure - I have not the exact words before me - that in the **British**.

* On the other hand, if it is proposed that they should continue to receive the Australian rate of pay while serving with the Imperial Navy, what is likely to be the feeling of **British** sailors when they know that men infinitely inferior to themselves in naval training are receiving for the same work a higher rate of pay?

* I have pointed out that it cannot be satisfactory to the sailors of the **British** Navy that our transferred men should be receiving a higher rate of pay.

* We cannot possibly hope to exchange with the **British** Navy, if we are going to adopt a higher rale of pay.

* In all probability we shall find that the annual cost will mount up to over 400,000, or more than double the subsidy which we are now paying to the **British** Navy.

* There is no doubt that valuable auriferous deposits exist in the island, and if a gold-field were discovered close to the border line, between **British** territory and that owned by Germany or Holland, it is easy to imagine that we might be dragged into a very serious quarrel.

* For instance, the Fly River flows partly between the Dutch and **British** territory, and the navigation of that stream is free to the subjects of Holland and Britain alike, except as regards warlike stores, and no duty is imposed upon goods conveyed into the island by that route.

* The **British** Government have consistently ignored the advice offered by Australian statesmen ; otherwise we should not have been called upon to consider such a proposal as that now before the House.

* The first of these was - 
That the establishment of a foreign power in the neighbourhood of Australia would be injurious to **British** and more particularly to Australian interests.

* Mr. Chester  carried out his instructions by hoisting the **British** flag, and formally proclaiming **British** control over the whole of that portion of New Guinea now held by Great Britain and Germany.

* The Council of the Royal Colonial Institute also appealed to the Imperial authorities to indorse the action of  Sir Thomas  Mcllwraith, but the **British** Government seemed strongly averse to doing anything of the kind, and after the negotiations had proceeded for some time they sent a despatch to the Queensland Government to the effect that  Sir Thomas  Mcllwraith^ action was unwarranted, and could not receive Imperial sanction.

* That action on the part of the **British** authorities, I think it will be generally admitted, was a great blunder.

* They endeavoured to induce the Imperial authorities to take possession of that portion of New Guinea which was then a **British** protectorate, and the representative of Queensland guaranteed the payment of 15,000 annually towards the expenses of its administration.

* But although that amount was guaranteed by Queeusland, New South "Wales and Victoria each pledged themselves to contribute 5,000 annually towards its payment, so that the expense of administering the affairs of **British** New Guinea was .equally shared by Queensland, New South ' Wales, and Victoria.

* Subsequent to the arrangement which was made between the Australian authorities and the **British** Government, the latter formally annexed what is now known as **British** New Guinea.

* Strange as it may seem, no successful protest was made on behalf of the **British** authorities, but two years later the Imperial Government recognised the action of Germany by arranging that the boundaries between **British** and German New Guinea should be defined.

* In all that has been  done in  connexion with **British** New Guinea, the Imperial authorities have acted in defiance of the wishes of Australia.

* A year later the **British** Government proclaimed a protectorate over the southern portion of the island instead of the whole of it which was not then under the control of a foreign power.

* That is to say, if either Germany or Holland desires to part with the territory at present occupied by them in New Guinea, the **British** Government should receive the first offer of acquiring it.

* Great Britain has been drawn into this war because in the first place she insisted upon **British** subjects being treated fairly, honestly, and equitably whilst resident in the Transvaal.

* But they chose to avail themselves of the intelligence and enterprise of **British** and Australian people, and having got them there they denied them ordinary rights, so that England had to come to the rescue, not of its own citizens, because these persons were not English taxpayers, but of citizens of the Empire, and to insist that they should receive fair treatment.

* But there were many questions which arose in the history of the Transvaal in which **British** Australians and American citizens demanded fair and rational treatment while in the country, but they could not get it.

* He speaks of the Boers as though they were an innocent people, who confined themselves to farm work, and were utterly surprised at the attack made upon them by the **British**.

* Does not the honorable and learned member know also that at the last moment it was the citizens of the Transvaal, the Boers, who went into Natal, who first trespassed on **British** territory, before England declared war?

* We may very reasonably, and I think we should, give the Government power to take the initial steps, to go on with the negotiations, because we are not in the position of asking the **British** Government to allow us to do this, but we are in the position of responding to to the **British** Government, whoare anxious that we should do it, which is a very different thing.

* That was a Commission the expenses of which were paid by a **British** citizen.

* This is a scheme for **British** preference, or it is nothing at all.

* In this case there is nothing in Great Britain of this kind to prefer, and therefore to impose the duty as suggested in this schedule is to prefer, not **British** strawboards, but Australian strawboards.

* The question is whether they are to be given protection in a straightforward manner, or under cover of **British** preference.

* This is not a proposal for protection, but for a preference to **British** goods.

* (**British**) 2d., (other) 2d.

* It is from the United States that those implements come, and it is really a useless placard in the New Zealand Act to say that it does not applyto **British** manufactures, seeing that these productions are not manufactured in Great Britain for export to this side of the world.

* I always respect a New Zealand precedent, and would respect it in connexion with a Bill of this kind, whenthere is a proposal to make an exception in favour of articles of **British** manufacture ; but in this case I hold that the precedent is not in the least degree applicable - that it is no precedent.

* Assuming that it is right to pass this part of the Bill in any form - and I think it right to pass it in some form, though not exactly in its present form - whatever it is right to apply to implements or articles manufactured elsewhere, it is right to apply, so far as this Bill is concerned - and I am referring only to the Bill - to articles of **British** manufacture.

* The amendment would constitute an exemption in their favour, and **British** manufacturers would be able to indulge in unfairness with intention to destroy.

* I have already said that I think there are one or two proposals in the Bill that should not apply to either **British** or any other goods.

* I think it is very unfortunate that the honorable member for Corio should have thought it necessary to speak about the consequences which might ensue if the **British** Government did something that they have never indicated their intention of doing.

* We should not close our eyes to the fact that our immunity from attack has been due to the fact that the **British** Empire has been behind us, and that any country contemplating an invasion of our territory would have to reckon with the **British** navy before they could get at us.

* While I refer to these matters I think it is really unnecessary to do so, because I believe that patriotism and loyalty and the ties of kinship alone are sufficiently strong to induce us to work in harmony with the **British** Empire as long as we can do so without abandoning our own rights.

* Yes, and as I understood, that despatch it indicated the wish of the **British** Government in regard to the adoption of the safest course in a difficult and delicate matter.

* I think it is wise, however, at the initial stage, to adopt either the suggestion made to us by the **British** Government or some effectual modification of it, if that can be done, without involving international complications.

* Mr. RONALD (Southern Melbourne).I should just like to point out in regard to the contention that we are likely to offend Japan, and in that way lead to **British** complications, that the natural ally of Great Britain is America, and that the sooner we give up - if we have any voice in the matter at all - leaning on such a broken reed as Japan, the better it will be.

* In another case, which was brought to my notice today, doubt has been expressed locally as to whether a pension can be granted to an applicant born of **British** parents, during a brief visit to the United States, prior to their coming to Australia, where they have voted and exercised the rights of citizens for about seventy years, until naturalization has taken place.

* They also say, as the honorable member for Lang has pointed out, that this preference, so far as it affects **British** imports, will be of practically no value, since the imports of candles from Great Britain last year were of the value of only , 2,762.

* I wish to supplement the remarks that I made on a previous occasion with a few figures, putting their bearings as they might present themselves to one of us were we **British** subjects resident in the United Kingdom.

* If there were a check of any sort imposed upon **British** development it is possible that England, which is now easily able to bear all the obligations cast upon it, might perhaps begin to stagger, as the poet has said, under the too vast orb of its fate.

* We must remember that the **British** Empire comprises 400,000,000 of people, that it has the most heterogeneous collection of units or elements that  any Empire could possibly have - races differing in all sorts of types and degrees of civilization, and Constitutions from the Federal of Australia and the Dominion of Canada to the unitary system of the Cape and the Transvaal, the Crown system of the Mauritius, the Straits Settlements, and Ceylon, and the Imperial system of India.

* In 1906, 71 per cent, of the exports Qf the mother country were to foreign countries, and only 28. per cent, to **British** Possessions.

* So that,  'prima facie,  it is of greater importance to the old country that its trade relations with foreign nations should remain undisturbed' than that its trade relations with **British** Possessions should not be interfered with.

* The export of **British**, and Irish produce to foreign countries represents 67 per cent., and to **British** Possessions only 32 per cent.

* Mr. Balfour  said - 
Empire trade with **British** Possessions and the United Kingdom is 75 per cent., and our export trade to the Empire represents 57 per cent of the total.

* My desire is to put what I consider to be the Imperial view so far as I think I have learnt it from reading the debates in England, and the statements published in that part of the **British** press which represents the best opinions of the United Kingdom.

* I ask the Committee, before soliciting a return which cannot be given- 
It may have been one of them, but the main point put forward, not only by Ministers, but by one consistent upholder of federation - the Sydney  Bulletin  - was that a united Australia could speak to the **British** Government in a strain that no single State could hope to adopt, and the complaint that I have against this 
Government is, not that they have neglected to fight the **British** Government on this matter, but that they have not even tried to do so.

* They have never made use of the fact that they represent all Australia, and that Australia has given expression to its desires on this matter in no uncertain way - they did not even go to the extent of making humble and respectful representations to the **British** Government.

* of all the difficulties, and especially in view of the fact that at that time there was a probability of federation being consummated within a short period, and of our being able -  acording  to the statements of the AttorneyGeneral, and the Prime Minister, and other advocates of the Bill - to speak to the **British** Government in such a manner as to ensure what we desired.

* If Ministers led the people to believe that they were going to take steps to absolutely exclude these aliens from Australia, how is it that, without making a fight and without firing a gun, they have, on the -first invitation, surrendered to the **British** Government?

* No ; I am prepared to admit that, as far as **British** subjects are concerned, we could not have done that.

* The point to which I principally wish to draw attention is that the Government, notwithstanding the position they took up at the federal elections, made no attempt to convince the **British** Government of the inefficiency of the course proposed by the Imperial authorities.

* The appointment of  Mr. Plummer  was made in view of the opinions that had been expressed in Parliament from time to time that it was desirable that some one should communicate to the **British** press matters of interest relating to Commonwealth affairs.

* His  appointment was due to the fact that he had been a considerable contributor to the **British** press.

* The honorable member for Coolgardie wishes to insinuate that because he was a New South Wales man - 
The honorable gentleman forgets that, apart from the inscription, the design of the Australian coinage would be different from that of the **British** coinage.

* All we ask is that the inscription  on  our coinage shall be accurate, and shall be the same as that on **British** coins - " King of Britain and Emperor of India."

* If we adhere to the inscription on **British** coinage we shall have no difficulty.

* is not in accord with **British** loyal sentiment.

* We have over 4,000,000 people in Australia to-day, as many as were in Great Britain at the time of Queen Elizabeth, and those 4,000,000 odd not only defended their own country against countries which had populations far in excess of their own, but commanded the near seas, and even went into the Pacific and Indian Oceans and created one of the brightest pages in **British** history.

* The difficulty has not decreased, but has rather increased in the interval, because the **British** Navy to-day is a power beyond all comparison with that which existed in the time of Queen Elizabeth.

* This was said by, Colonel Foster, a distinguished **British** officer, who is the Director of Military Science at the Sydney University - 
A great many people have said things that even when uttered did not find acceptance.

* We have seen the difficulties of modern' transport, and know that so long as there is a **British** Navy  moving, it is impossible to put any force on our shores.

* If there is no **British** Navy, or it has been severely defeated in the Eastern seas, it may be possible to land some men here, but it would take a long time to land any number, and surely there will be opportunities of drilling those trained in their youth, so long as we keep up the war materiel, without spending large sums of money many years beforehand.

* The latest statement on the subject by the Prime Minister which I have been able to discover is contained in the following report - 
Whilst the policy behind the men and the guns of the **British** Fleet is that of 40,000,000, in addition to the people of the rest of the Empire, which embraces an enormous population.

* According to the report, the Prime Minister continued - 
Certainly ; but many Australians who left to fight in South Africa did so at the expense of the **British** Government, although it is true that some Australian troops were paid for by us.

* It is said that once we have secured the safety of our harbors, we shall have discharged our duty ; that we ought not to contribute anything to the great fleet that polices the seas and defends the commerce of the whole Empire, including our own; that we have nothing to contribute towards its maintenance, and nothing to thank the **British** Navy for.

* We should be ready to contribute more than we have done to the upkeep of the **British** Navy, rather than to reduce the little we have given.

* I am objecting to a policy which would reduce the little we give towards the upkeep of the **British** Navy, and am urging that we should give as much as we can or as much as we think is reasonable to assist in our own defence.

* Those resolutions which, as I - say, were unanimously adopted, improved the position as regards **British** shipping ; but the Bill has gone further in the way of injuriously affecting that shipping than in some instances did the original Bill introduced before the Conference.

* I think that the Prime Minister has had some correspondence with the- **British** authorities on the subject; but I do not know whether, in consequence, any alteration has been made in the present measure.

* case, I think the Conference has been treated in a most extraordinary way, which makes a bad return for the ready agreement of the **British** representatives to our controlling our own coastal trade and shipping registered in .

* He has pointed out the difficulty of control in an island that consists of Dutch New Guinea, German ' New Guinea, and **British** New Guinea ; and has pointed out the alarming dangers in the way of Australia unless she is prepared to defend her land frontiers.

* I have not had time to read the official correspondence on the matter, and while I admit that the question is a most difficult one, I am influenced in determining the way in which I shall vote, by the fact that I think that **British** New Guinea would stand as a buffer between Australia and the eastern nations.

* At all events it has been strongly urged that if Australia assumed full control of **British** New Guinea, Great Britain would not afford us the assistance of her fleet in carrying out the administration.

* It was passed to deal with dumping, and especially dumping on the part of **British** manufacturers.

* It was urged that whilst Canada was prepared to deal with Great Britain in preference to her next door neighbour, the United States, or any European country, the Canadian workman must not be brought down to the level of the **British** workman, as indicated by the last  speaker.

* He has contended that it is un-**British** and disloyal, that the measure is a cut against the old' country, and has pointed out that American artisans are better housed, clothed, paid and educated than are **British** workmen.

* I would point out to the right honorable gentleman that alongside the State of Victoria a whole **British** community  have for years had their doors open to everything, fertilizers included, and instead of the farming industry withering and pining away, the increase in the area under cultivation in New South Wales in a- few years equals the increase in Victoria and South Australia put together.

* There is a perpetual attempt to surround Messrs. Smith and Co., Lennon and Co., Brown and Sons, and a number of other individual firms with a sort of preserve, in which they can milk the Australian public, including the farmer, at their leisure without any disturbance from the rude foreigner, under which term we include our **British** fellow-subjects.

* I had anticipated that the present **British** Cabinet would propose some forward step before the next general elections took place.

* But, in addition to that, a close examination is being made of the whole circumstances connected with our **British** trade, and our foreign trade likely to be affected by proposals of this nature.

* But this policy must have as its foundation the recognition of the fact that this Empire is **British** in authority and control., It cannot be all **British** in its population.

* It is **British** only fractionally.

* It has been urged that because the **British** Government sent out 1,000 soldiers to take part in the Commonwealth celebrations, we should therefore send home a considerable body of men to represent us during the Coronation ceremonies.

* If, therefore, we think it is better for us to protect the taxpayers of the Common wealth, and not commit any extravagance, I am sure that the **British** Government will recognise that we have had an important duty to discharge nearer home which has prevented us from accepting their invitation to the fullest extent.

* The fate of the **British** Empire may be decided at any one spot in the civilized globe.

* is shown that what has been represented in Australia through the cables published in the newspapers, to the effect that Great Britain is against a policy of preference is not warranted - that what has been published here is not a true interpretation of **British** feeling to-day.

* The principle upon which the Government has acted has been to have regard to the immense foreign trade which is undermining **British** importations to Australia to-day, and leading to an increased foreign trade.

* The Government wish to see a change from foreign trade to **British** trade.

* But our object is at the same time so to arrange the Tariff as to secure that a greater portion of the large importations from foreign countries shall be transferred and enter Australia through **British** channels.

* To secure that will be to do an immense amount of good to **British** trade, and to **British** manufacturers, while at the same time conserving to a very great extent our trade within the **British** Empire.

* I say that is true; and that that would be the result if we had the whole, or nearly the whole, of the **British** market for our foodstuffs.

* Mirror - 
So, in regard to the Australian Tariff, of which particulars had just come to hand when we went to press with our issue of 14th August, we pointed out that there was " assuredly no intention to put **British** manufacturers on a level with local producers, but to keep them  in  front of their foreign competitors"-  
That is the true position -  though we maintained that the preference given was not a "sham," as some politicians would have us believe.

* And since something like two-thirds of the Australian over-sea commerce is with the United Kingdom, howcould they carry out their policy unless they protected their own manufacturers against the competition of **British** firms, since they alonehad so large a share of the trade?

* AH he proposed to do was to raise the duties against foreigners, while leaving the duties which **British** importers would have to pay at a level which would confer complete protection to the Australian manufacturer.

* They recognise that although we failed in our efforts to induce the **British** Government to enter into a reciprocal agreement, we did not decline for that reason to grant any (preference to the old country.

* The Government have brought down proposals which will give a substantial preference to **British** manufacturers in respect of the main items affected, representing at the present time large importations from foreign countries.

* If we carry, not a halfandhalf, but a truly protectionist Tariff, as the country intended, **British** manufacturers will obtain a share of our present trade with foreign countries, whilst there will still be ample room for the local manufacture and production of many of the articles now imported from foreign countries.

* I simply held that, as a matter of **British** justice, an accused person should be found guilty before punishment was inflicted.

* The only transaction that I have had in respect of the **British** Imperial Oil Company is this : that whilst I was away from my home one of its representatives left there a lamp filled with oil, with a request that we should burn it.

* I pointed out that in that way we should receive the protection of the **British** fleet in exchange for a contribution towards its aid and support.

* Among the papers which have been placed before us is the memorandum by the 
The  Admiralty  have accepted the responsibility for protecting all **British** territory abroad against organized attack by sea.

* On account of its insular character and its geographical position, there is no **British** territory so little liable to aggression of this kind as that of Australasia, so long as **British** naval supremacy is maintained in Eastern waters.

* Moreover, as such attacks reveal the position of the raiding vessels to the **British** ships whose duty it is to bring them to action, they must' necessarily be of a hasty and fugitive character.

* The annual cost of the **British** Navy has been practically doubled since our last agreement  was entered  into, and the enormous sum of 70,000,000 is now appropriated for the defences of Great Britain.

* Both absolutely and relatively, to probable enemies, the **British** Navy has never been so strong, or so efficient in peace time as it how is ; but this result has been attained only in recent years, and by strenuous efforts.

* The **British** Navy holds the Empire together.

* I should still desire to have the protection of the **British** fleet.

* It seems to me that there is no serious danger to Australia until the **British** Navy is defeated.

* Raiding vessels must defeat or elude the **British** ships operating near their ports of departure, and they must also defeat or elude the vessels engaged in the defence of the Commonwealth, before we shall be called upon to 'employ those military forces upon which, I believe, we have mis-spent vast sums of money.

* As a further proof of the necessity of paying more attention to our naval defences, let me quote an extract from the  United Service Gazette  of 27th July, 1901, as follows : - 
One good shove find this ill-joined mosaic of the **British** Empire will fall to pieces.

* It is objected that this means that the squadron is not designed for the defence of Australia ; that it will be only a portion of the **British** Navy, and will not be available for the defence of Australia when Australia will perhaps be most in need of it.

* I should like to point out that if the Commonwealth established a navy of its own, and the necessity arose for concentrating **British** ships in the China Sea, in order to resist the debarkation of troops for the invasion of India, or any other part of the **British** dominions, no power in any Legislature in Australia could arrest  the desire or theclamour of the people of  Australia that our navy should take part in those operations.

* England were about to resist the  concentra-tion  of some Russian Squadron in the far North East, would not the Japanese Navy quit the Sea of Japan and join the **British** fleet, leaving Japan, perhaps, defenceless?

* Whether that expedition was aimed at; Japan or India, or any" **British** possession, [ hold that the Japanese Navy would have no hesitation in leaving the Japanese coast undefended, for the moment, in order to join in these operations, which would probably afford the best means of avoiding the aggression upon them or some **British** possession.

* We are no more proposing to pay other people to fight for us than the noncombatants of England are in paying other people to fight for them by supporting the **British** army.

* When the settlers came to Australia we had **British** soldiers stationed in barracks and forts to defend us.

* Subsequently we combined our volunteer regiments with the **British** forces stationed here.

* When the **British** troops were withdrawn the **British** ships remained, and finally it was said that we should contribute something towards the cost of an auxiliary squadron.

* Now we are taking another step by providing for an Australian Squadron as an auxiliary of the **British** Navy.

* I take it that in this development, going on step by step, we shall eventually provide an Australian Navy which will be of our own creation, paid for by Australia, and working in co-operation with the **British** Navy.

* When we are adopting the very best means known to us to secure an adequate defence, and to secure it at a cost so ridiculously low, that the opponents  of the agreement taunt us with proposing to give a twopenny-halfpenny contribution to the cost of the **British** Navy, I say that we are fulfilling to the utmost letter of the law what is demanded of us by the Constitution in regard to the naval defence of Australia.

* I think' that the only weak point in this magnificent engine Of defence, the **British** Navy, is" its inability to obtain the men necessary for manning it in time of war.

* The article to which I have referred points out that - 
Thus, if these ideas were carried out, our growing Australian naval men could secure adequate training in the **British** Navy.

* To my mind, the idea of a Federation of all the **British** communities is a magnificent dream, impossible of realization.

* Furthermore, if when the States entered into federation they had constituted themselves a separate nation, under a  President  elected by their own people, instead of into a Commonwealth under the Crown of Great Britain, the value of Australia to Great Britain would have remained the same, and the loyalty of our people to those of the **British** race would have been unaffected.

* It is a pride and glory in, and a sincere affection for, the people of the **British** race.

* To the honour of the **British** race, no exception can be taken to that statement.

* The proposal of the honorable member is that that provision shall still apply, and that clause 9, which deals with the prohibition of immigrants intended to be brought out in connexion with industrial disputes, shall still apply to all **British** subjects, and, in fact, to every one outside Australia.

* That condition also is to apply to **British** subjects, and to all others without restriction.

* The provision is to apply to all people, whether white or coloured, except those whom the honorable member has, in brief phraseology, designated as **British** subjects.

* Except in the case of **British** subjects born in the United Kingdom or their descendants born in any part of the **British** Empire 
That the following words be inserted at the commencement of paragraph  b :  - " except in the case of **British** subjects born in the United Kingdom or their descendants born in any part of the **British** Empire."

* It is very strange to hear honorable members who are continually crying out for **British** fair play, talking about boycotting societies which have complied with the laws of Australia, and challenged the Government to send an actuary to their offices.

* With few exceptions, however, the local banks crossed the eternal stream ; the only ones that did not go over were those having **British** connexions from which they could obtain foreign money.

* B - But it has a **British** connexion, and every ship that arrived here at the time brought money to it.

* Why should we attempt to enforce our theories as to the conditions under which whites shall settle in **British** New Guinea, and give them no opportunity to say what those conditions should be?

* I am amongst those who regret very much that the Government in charge of the measure at the time gave way to theorists in the matter of land settlement in **British** New Guinea.

* They state, at all events, in general terms that an attempt to apply prohibition to **British** New Guinea would completely fail.

* I shall vote for the amendment moved by the honorable member for  Fiemantle,  assuming that it will cover all white residents in **British** New Guinea, and will not necessarily be restricted to those of European extraction.

* The boast of the **British** people for all time has been that they are willing to receive, in the freest and frankest spirit, every person who is willing to conform to the.

* That has been a material element of strength in the  building up of the **British** nation, and it seems to me that it is rather late in the day for anyother action to be advocated by those who seek to lead public opinion in a **British** community.

* Has he taken any further steps to have a number of representative pressmen from different parts of the Empire visit Australia as guests of the Commonwealth next year during, the visit of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, as suggested by the Australian Press Association, so that the resources of the Commonwealth might be placed before the **British** public in the interests of Australian trade and immigration?

* Besides that, we have to consider that in the expenditure of the Pacific Cable Company, which amounted, in 1904, to 167,000, and, in 1905, to 163,000, was included a sum of 77,000 for the repayment of a loan at 3 per cent., and that of the amount contributed annually by the **British**, Canadian, and Commonwealth Governments, 35,000 is every year devoted to renewals, or written off for depreciation.

* I ask to what better purpose can the cable be applied during some of its idle hours than in co-operation with a free Press to promote general intercourse and benefit the **British** people?

* It would directly place before each section of the **British** world the views formed or forming in all other sections.

* Any one who has lived in or travelled through that State must be fully aware of the fact that it is overrun by aliens, and by those whom we are supposed to allow into the country, because they are **British** subjects in common with ourselves.

* The **British** Postmaster- General is absolutely powerless.

* Honorable members opposite can twist and torture the words as they please, but, in their hearts, they know that the only reason for the insertion of the words in the **British** contract is that the boats may be utilized by the Admiralty for war purposes.

* The **British** contract says that when the public interest demands it, the terms of the subvention shall be executed.

* If the **British** Government lias these wide powers, why not put them into our contract?

* I am dealing with the last contract of the **British** Government with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.

* If the provisions in the **British** Government contracts would serve our purposes, why havethey not been inserted in this, contract ?

* If all these meanings can be read into the **British** contracts, why are they not a Mowed to be read into this contract?

* Evidently this contract goes beyond the **British** contracts.

* We know that the **British** contracts have no such wide application, but that the provision in this contract to which I have referred has been inserted as a socialistic sop to the Labour corner.

* The mail-boats running under the terms of the **British** contracts arerequired to obtain the approval of the Admiralty in order that only such vessels may be employed as could be advantageously called upon in times of war.

* The **British** PostmasterGeneral has no power to buy or charter any vessel.

* There is a revolution almost every week in some country or other in which **British** interests are involved.

* We cannot, therefore, expect s Australia to receive the whole of the attention of the **British** people.

* I left Mellish Reef on Saturday, 22nd April, 1905, and ran with an almost sinking ship for the Katau River, **British** New Guinea, for the purpose of entering the river, careening, and repairing the vessel.

* The Bill appears to me to be a mixture of the **British** Army Act, the regulations of war - a term that is obsolete in the old country - and our State Acts.

* I have the greatest possible feeling of indulgence for the spirit which animates **British** Ministers in viewing measures of this sort with disfavour.

* Any person who, when asked to do so, fails to write out in the characters of any language of Europe a passage in English of 50 words in length, tait en by the officer from a **British** author, and append his name in his own language.

* It seems to me that the hysteria of this matter is to throw over this momentous epoch in the history-making of Australia the shadow of these references to possible consequences to the might and interest of the **British** Empire.

* Notwithstanding all the hysterical fear which overshadows the minds of Ministers regarding the sentiments of the Mikado of Japan, there is a solemn treaty in existence between Great Britain and Japan, and in that treaty Japan expressly recognises the right of the -self-governing colonies of the **British** Empire to be exempt from its operations.

* It means the recognition by Japan herself that these colonies are self-governing communities, that they have the right to fashion their destiny as their Parliaments decide, and that if Japan wishes to have a treaty or understanding with Australia or Canada - and the smallest dependency, Newfoundland, is not omitted - in reference to matters of mutual concern, such treaty is to be arranged between the **British** selfgoverning colonies concerned and the Government of Japan.

* Therefore, we know that our legislation is subject to the risk, as is the legislation of the **British** House of Parliament, of being vetoed.

* We have his assurance, and 1 think it is founded upon a proper knowledge and principle, that if we are in earnest and mean what we say, the **British** Government will not take the responsibility of interfering with our legislation.

* That right has been recognised by the **British** Government and by the Japanese Government, in connexion with the instrument 1 have referred to.

* I am not loyal to an individual but to a principle, and the principle is the feeling of the **British** people to-da)', and their inclinations in the future.

* We are at present contributing ,-tl26,000 per year towards the Australian Auxiliary Squadron, and it would be better, even if we doubled this amount, to continue under the protection of the **British**  Navy.

* The public at large desire the **British** race to be brought closer together, though some of them do not like the term Imperialism.

* He says in one part of his speech that,, if we do not have a navy of our own, we shall be placed in a defenceless position if the **British** Navy is withdrawn from our shores.

* I propose to move - 
In **British** coinage, $183 represents 38 2s.

* It is a wellknown principle of **British** law to hold every person innocent until he is proved guilty.

* I take it that this Bill is intended to overcome the objections which have been urged against the principal Act, so far as thev relate to the introduction of **British** immigrants under contract to employers in Australia.

* It has struck me as peculiar, in considering legislation of this character, that we have the Prime Minister, and presumably the members of his Government, on the one hand emphasizing the need which the Commonwealth has for immigration, while on the other we find them bringing forward measures which have for their object the restriction of immigration, and the interposing of obstacles to the admission of **British** settlers, which must give rise to a great deal of irritation, misunderstanding, and dissatisfaction amongst our kith and kin in other portions of the Empire.

* They say Australia as a whole should be placed before the **British** people, who have invested ^147,000,000 privately in the Commonwealth, and ^197,000,000 in State and municipal bonds.

* They have led to the opinion, right or wrong, amongst our brethren of the **British** Empire, that Australia is a good country to keep out of.

* The strong feeling that exists among **British** sailors, dock hands, and the waterside workers against the employment of Chinese on **British** ships has broken out into violence at Poplar, a parish in the East End of London.

* These violent methods have been adopted with the object of intimidating the Chinese, and preventing tbem taking employment on **British** ships.

* The **British** sailors allege that many of the Chinese cannot pass the language test, which the law insists shall be imposed on foreigners seeking employment on **British** vessels.

* Is the Prime Minister prepared in view of these, facts to- givepreference to **British** goods handled by the yellow agony to the exclusion of white men?

* Does he think that a Government which gets the white man to fight battles and shed blood for the preservation of the Empire is acting honestly- 
Yesterday I asked a question in reference to an instruction given for the free admission of certain otherwise dutiable paper of **British** origin used for the publication of the  Bulletin.

* I found that on the 2nd September last the following urgent wire was sent by the Collector of Customs, Sydney: - 
That the proviso be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :  - " Provided that where by any provision of the Constitution, or of any Act, or State Act, a distinction is made between the rights, powers, or privileges of natural-born **British** subjects, and those of persons naturalized in the Commonwealth or in a State, the rights, powers, and privileges conferred by this section shall, for the purposes of that provision, be only those (if any) to which persons so naturalized are therein expressed to be entitled."

* What is sometimes termed a mosquito fleet was proposed : small vessels available for the defence of harbors and for offensive operations at no great distance from the mainland, in association with the forts, and as auxiliaries to the **British** squadron in these seas.

* Otherwise, unless there were perpetual transfers to distant squadrons of the Empire, perhaps on the other side of the world, which would involve great cost and loss of time, we should never be able to maintain the efficiency demanded by the **British** Navy.

* To-day, at comparatively small expense and with little delay we are to have what may fairly be termed an Australian squadron, a unit constituting one-third of the great fleet which will protect the Imperial flag, Australia, and other **British** possessions in the eastern Pacific.

* Until any mass power brought into these waters is dispersed, that fleet will operate, as its name implies and as is intended, as one fleet, under one flag, and one control, thus dealing with the one grave danger which the **British** Dominions in this part of the world have to face.

* It is certainly a course which would be welcomed there, since the **British** lender is always seeking for securities of the high class which, fortunately, Australia is able to offer.

* The strategical situation, moreover, of Western Australia, dominating, as it does, the southern side of the Indian Ocean, and the converging trade routes from the West, must be considered as of the greatest importance to **British** and Australian interests.

* I submit that the construction of a line of railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie would not materially influence the condition of the **British** Navy.

* It is impossible to foresee the result of naval warfare in the future, or to anticipate the effect of fleets acting on the part of a combination of great Powers hostile to **British** Imperial interests.

* I. wish to point out, in passing, that these proposals are more drastic in their nature than are any similar provisions operating in any Parliament in the **British** Empire.

* Then again, they are more severe than are the Standing Orders of the **British** House of Commons, inasmuch as  Mr. Speaker,  or the  Chairman,  as the cass may be, has to decide whether effect, shall be given to a proposal to apply the closure.

* I admit that in that Assembly there is a closure standing order applying to individual speeches as well as to motions or other subjects of debate; but the particular proposals now before us are more severe than are similar Standing Orders of any Parliament in the **British** Empire.

* The motion now before us comprises the severest provisions relating to the closing of debate that are to be found in the Standing Orders of any other Parliament in the **British** Dominions, but we find that those checks which to some extent would safeguard the rights of honorable members, have been carefully excluded.

* I find, by reference to  Coghlan,  that the largest quantity of butter ever exported from Australia to the **British** market only represented 10 per cent, of the **British** importations.

* Joseph Chamberlain, and which contains figures relating to **British** and foreign trade and industrial conditions.

* It is not a fact that the great bulk of foreign nations exclude **British** shipping from their coasting trade.

* The Blue Book to which I have referred proves to demonstration that that statement is utterly without foundation ; and the London  Times,  in a series of articles which were written specially for the purpose of bolstering up  Mr. Chamberlain's  case, declares that any foreign country could retaliate upon **British** shipping for any action which might be taken in the direction of excluding foreign shipping from trade with her distant possessions.

* Upon page 185 I find the following:- 
A perusal of this Blue Book shows that the alleged injury to **British** shipping is of the most trifling character.

* The  Times,  which, as honorable members know, is in sympathy with  Mr. Chamberlain's  policy, has pointed out that **British** shipping offers an ample target for retaliation.

* They allow all **British** boats to enter into their coasting trade, as well as the trade between the Fatherland and its Colonies.

* This Blue Book shows to what a small extent **British** shipping has been injured by foreign vessels.

* The growth of **British** shipping since 1864, when the Navigation Act was repealed, has been remarkable.

* Mr. Walter  Runciman, a member of the **British** House of Commons, and an eminent authority on shipping, points out that of the 8,200 steam-ships which fly the **British** flag, about 6,900 are tramps.

* Seventy-five per cent, of the **British** ships are tramps, and they form the backbone of **British** mercantile supremacy.

* It is, therefore, of vital importance that we should refrain from passing legislation against **British** shipping, or any law that would have the effect of preventing tramp vessels from coming to our shores.

* To quote from the report of a select committee of the **British** House of Commons upon the effect of subsidies upon **British** trade - 
France, Spain, and Portugal have adopted similar measures.

* I shall not deal with the  maunderings  of  Senator Guthrie  in regard to the matter ; but the Government should make it clear whether it is their desire to exclude from the coast of Australia the shipping of all other parts of the civilized world, **British** vessels included.

* There may be some later figures, but those I have quoted serve to show the serious disability under which **British** shipping labours in competing with foreign shipping.

* Although honorable members may differ upon questions of fiscal policy, labour legislation, and other matters more or less immaterial to the present discussion, every one of us has sufficient intelligence to know that the only hope of Australia's future is as part of the **British** Empire.

* We send our wheat, grain, and dairy and other produce to Great Britain, and sell it there at prices much lower than those at which it can profitably be produced locallyOur primary products are obtained at what to the **British** farmer would be sweating rates, and.

* But the **British** farmer might make that assertion, and might, for his protection, demand the enactment of legislation such as this.

* If the **British** Parliament granted his request, what would become of our export trade?

* He did not treat the old land as a pariah, an outcast, or an enemy, but he placed **British** and Australian, goods on the same footing.

* He classed **British** and Australian goods together.

* The discussion has convinced me that the **British** system of parliamentary government is not sufficiently modern.

* I remember speaking to a prominent banker in **British** Columbia- 
Then the Treasurer does not understand the question at all.

* - The **British** Government do.

* There is no hope of the **British** people adopting decimal currency within a reasonable period, and I do not think that we should postpone indefinitely the reforms which we desire to bring about.

* It is here that the Commonwealth Government cease to ask the **British** Government to help us to institute decimal coinage.

* requested that the coins should be minted in London instead of in Australia, he asked merely  for  what had already been offered, and  for  the withdrawal of 200,000 annually instead of 100,000, which the **British** Government had offered.

* The mint authorities further stated that it would require a considerable amount of machinery to carry out this work in the 
**British** mints in Australia.

* All that he contemplated was to enter into a conference with other Imperial representatives, with a view to ascertaining whether anything could be done in the direction of securing decimal coinage for the whole **British** Empire, and insuring that the profits derived should be distributed  -pro rata  amongst the various portions of the Empire.

* Whilst abroad I inquired into this question, and learned that other parts of the **British** Dominions are more anxious than we are to secure the profit to be derived from the coinage of silver;.

* She replaced that money by Canadian currency, coined in the **British** Royal Mint, paying  3  per cent, over the cost of the si  Itver  used in the silver coinage and 10 per cent, over the cost of the metal contained in the copper coinage.

* I recognise that it would be wrong for us as a **British** dependency to collect 1,000,000 of our silver currency and suddenly land it in London, although in reserve in the banks it would be just as good as gold.

* The experience of Canada is valuable to us, since it is similar in many respects to Australia, and is also a **British** dependency.

* The report sets forth that - 
This profit in **British** currency would be equal to 250,118.

* I was inclined to agree with the right honorable member for East Sydney at the time, but on reflection I am now disposed to think that the attitude Of the Minister is correct, and that the Federal Parliament has complete and full jurisdiction over, at any rate, **British** ships coming from the old country and travelling between Australian ports.

* 60, section 736, where it is provided - 
The Legislature of a **British** possession may, by any Act or ordinance, regulate the coastingtrade of that **British** possession, subject in every case to the following conditions :  - 
The Act or ordinance shall contain a suspending clause providing that the Act or ordinance shall not come into operation until Her Majesty's pleasure thereon has been publicly signified in the **British** possession in which it has been passed.

* The Act or ordinance shall treat all **British** ships (including the ships of any other **British** possession) in exactly the same manner as ships of the **British** possession in which it is made.

* Power is conferred on the Parliament of the Commonwealth to deal with all **British** ships engaged in the coastal trade.

* Here we have authority to exercise the same power that the Imperial Parliament itself can exercise over shipping within the **British** dominions.

* So far as statutory authority is concerned, I think we have ample power to deal with **British** ships.

* So it seems to me that the Minister is right in the contention that he has power to legislate - and it ought to be done by legislation and not by regulation - for **British** ships in the direction suggested.

* Yes ; any regulations under that Act must be  by  the Legislature of the **British** dominions itself, and if this Federal Legislature wishes to pass a law in the direction suggested I have no doubt it can be done, but it must be done expressly by the Legislature and not by delegated authority.

* Also Japanese ships, or any ships not carrying the **British** flag.

* But as regards **British** ships, such as the Orient and Peninsular and Oriental ships, and others coming from **British** possessions, I entertain not the slightest doubt that legislation in the direction proposed by the Minister will be not only just and reasonable, but absolutely constitutional and consistent with the principles of international law.

* No discussion has taken place as to the right of the Customs to make regulations dealing with any kind of ship - whether **British** or foreign - while it is within our harbors.

* I find that the importations under this heading are valued at 179,000, of which only 14,000 worth are of **British** origin.

* (Metals and Machinery), item 225, General, 5 per cent., **British**, free.

* It has not been shown that the owners of the coasting vessels are asking for these provisions, and we know that the wages on Australian vessels are higher than those paid elsewhere; whilst the freights and fares that are charged by the **British** and foreign vessels which are said to compete for our coasting trade are nearly double those charged by the coastal vessels.

* Our people must therefore continue to be largely dependent on **British** and foreign vessels for the conveyance of their produce to outside markets.

* Consequently, I claim that **British** New Guinea is not a country which lends itself to the application of the principle of prohibition.

* Our guides in a matter of this kind should not be persons who have never visited **British** New Guinea, but those who have spent the best years of their lives there.

* 7356  Papua (**British**  [REPRESENTATIVES ]New  Guinea) Bill.

* In speaking of the proposal to prohibit the importation of alcohol into **British** New Guinea,  Mr. A.  J. Craigen, a medical officer, says - 
The honorable member for Cowper, who is such an enthusiastic temperance reformer, would drive these men to undertake the illicit distillation of liquor, which would constitute an evil ten times worse than that which he seeks to remedy.

* During the course of this debate a great deal has been said in reference to the consumption of liquor in **British** New Guinea.

* These facts go to show that the climate of **British** New Guinea is one which invites the consumption of liquor.

* I remember well, as Premier of a State, using .all the influence I could bring to bear in favour of the establishment of an all -**British** cable between the United Kingdom and these parts of the Empire.

* But in view of the attitudetaken by the **British**, the Canadian, and the New Zealand Governments, I feel that we, at least, owe their representations the courtesy of examiiiation.

* The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has pointed out that it is comparatively easy to trace the origin of **British** spirit, and it appears - according to the statements of the journal in question, which is an authoritative publication - that it would be equally easy to trace the origin of French spirit.

* Mv colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, has asked me to write to the **British** Government requesting them to assist us - by means of their certificates - to trace the origin of spirits of **British** manufacture, and to identify them.

* It is our Empire and not the Empire of other people, and we are under an obligation to assist in maintaining it, not in the interests of others, but in our own interests, which I hold, are identical with the interests of the **British** race.

* But I hold that it is farcical to say that _we are prepared to encourage trade with Great Britain in the matter of boots and shoes, if we are only willing to extend a preference of 10 per cent, to her as against other countries, and are prepared to levy a sufficiently high impost upon her manufactures to exclude **British** boots.

* I hold in m.y hand a circular which, was recently issued under the auspices of the Melbourne Trades and Labour Council, and which reads - 
The " foreign tenderer " referred to in that circular is a **British** manufacturer.

* I am not a protectionist ; but it is perfectly logical for the protectionist to argue that it is equally necessary to protect local industries from **British** competition as from foreign competition.

* If she grants a preference to Australian wheat as against that from Russia, Egypt, and other countries outside the **British** Empire 
It it were not, I am satisfied that the landlords would, at all events, increase the rentals of their tenantry.

* The Government propose that a preference shall be granted in- respect of only **British** goods imported in **British** bottoms.

* The motion does not require that only white **British** sailors shall be employed on such vessels.

* Goods brought out in **British** ships manned by foreigners would under it be entitled1 to a preference.

* What might be described as a **British** vessel, controlled by a board of directors sitting' in England, might, as the honorable member for Newcastle has pointed out, be owned by a company in which foreign capital had been largely invested.

* I should not be prepared to support a proposition of this kind that did not provide, as proposed by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, that the men employed on **British** vessels conveying **British** products to Australia should be white **British** subjects.

* I might be disposed to support the granting of a preference to **British** goods brought out in **British** ships worked by white **British** subjects ; but I certainly would not be induced to vote for the granting of a preference to **British** goods merely on the ground that they had been brought out in ships- that were nominally **British**-owned.

* If the Government proposal were carried it might tend to the advantage of shareholders in **British** shipping companies, but I fail to see what gain would accrue to the producers of Australia.

* Whilst I should certainly prefer to see all vessels entering our ports flying the **British** flag, rather than those of other nations, I willingly admit that but for the German and French mail steamers we should not have had the accommodation now afforded us by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and the Orient Steam Navigation Company.

* I repeat that whilst the Government proposal might tend to slightly advantage **British** shipbuilding firms it would not confer any great benefit on the mother country.

* It has been, stated that my amendment, upon which a division was taken yesterday, was intended to admit **British** goods into Australia which were competing dishonorably or unfairly  with  Australian goods, or which were being dumped in order to destroy Australian industry.

* My proposal was to exclude the possibility - I might say the likelihood - of **British** , goods being prevented from entering Australia, although their competition be such as inmy opinion is absolutely honest and fair.

* In connexion with my proposed amendment to a previous clause, I said that if Great Britain were to enact a provision similar to paragraph  a,  the bulk of our exports would be shut out of the **British** market.

* I think it should be evident to any one who reads the clause carefully that when we send to Great Britain meat, fruits - the application to fruits is more limited I admit - and butter, and it leads to similar goods being no longer produced in Great Britain, or to some being withdrawn from the market, and to some not being saleable at a profit unless the wages in" Great Britain are to go lower than they are - for we find that in some cases the **British** farmer cannot produce in competition - then if the **British** Parliament were to pass a measure with a clause such as I have described, Australian goods, to a large extent, must be excluded1.

* It was because the Bill would render perfectly legitimate trading of this kind, if indulged in by exporters from Great Britain, subject to prohibition, and, under the Customs Act, to which the measure makes special reference, forfeiture of the goods sent here, that I moved the amendment exempting **British** goods which, last night, was negatived on division.

* came from **British** possessions, while, in 1905, 1,054.209 cwts.

* came from **British** possessions, an increase of 422,224 cwts., or 2i, 1:11 tons, which accounts for practically the whole increase in the period to which I am referring.

* That is a very fortunate and very happy circumstance, but it does not justify the statement that 'there is no interference on the ' part of Australia and New Zealand with the **British** producer.

* We do not know, lowever, whether he intends to propose a reduction of our moderately protective rluties so far as **British** goods are con- cerned, or whether the existing duties are to be retained as against Great Britain, and higher duties levied upon foreign goods.

* I had written to her on the subject of old-age pensions, and in her reply, she said - 
There is nothing in Greek tragedy more pitiful than the spectacle of a **British** working man, it this stage of civilization, looking for work, and looking for it in vain."

* If we are to grant a substantial preference to **British** goods, we might at least ask the Imperial authorities to endow the manhood of England and Ireland with the same political rights which we enjoy in Australia to-day.

* I love the **British** race, but it makes me sad to reflect upon the infamy which it has been called upon to bear.

* By so doing, a brighter view would be opened up to the **British** nation, which has too long been subjected to the trammels of caste and .

* I feel that the Prime Minister would not have taken the step which we are considering had he not felt it his duty to do so; but I should like to know what pressure was put on the members of the **British** Board of Trade from this end to induce them to send a cablegram to the Government.

* According to the Prime Minister, there are treaties in existence which affect our right to give a preference to **British** ships.

* No doubt we should regard our treaty obligations; but we might very well pass the Bill as it stands, giving the preference to **British** ships, and exempting Egyptian imports, if the claim were made that the treaty with Egypt overrides our legislation.

* Let us provide for a preference to **British** shipping, and when a case arising under a treaty comes before us, recognise our treaty obligations, if any.

* I do not like to suggest that possibly the Government are less anxious to secure preference to **British** ships, because of the possible complications which the white labour provision may create.

* If, in spile of that provision, they are desirous of adhering to the important policy of giving preference to **British** ships, I counsel them to accept the Senate's request, and to deal with special cases as they arise, in accordance with the principles of international law.

* **British** ships, until the 31st day of August, 1907, and thereafter on such goods imported in such ships manned exclusively by white seamen.

* I ask the Treasurer whether the preferential trade proposals of the  Government  exclude **British** Possessions outside the United Kingdom.

* Those words do not inelude **British** Possessions.

* I should say that they ought to mean the **British** Empire.

* The Labour Government were put out on a technicality, and by methods repugnant to **British** instincts of fair play.

* I understand that he regards the Bill introduced in the Victorian Parliament in connexion with the recent railway strike as being the offspring of panic, or hysteria, as a kind of affront to the principles of **British** liberty, and as an insult to the people of Australia.

* At page 514 of Clement's  Canadian Constitution,  the author gives the 101st section of the **British** North America Act.

* Nothing in the history of the world has had such civilizing influences as the system of **British** jurisprudence, and the idea of keeping in the current of that great stream is one not unworthy of our young nationhood.

* One is to keep the sap running from the root of **British** jurisprudence everywhere throughout the Empire.

* We have examples before us of the **British** Annuity System, about which something was said on a former occasion, and into the merits of which I need not enter at this juncture.

* These persons supervise all private assurances in Germany, and they are charged with powers which, in a **British** community, would be looked upon as savouring of tyranny, .although they do not appear to have been cavilled at in Germany.

* It had to forge its way against the competition of strong companies such as the A.M. P. Society and the National Mutual Society, not to mention **British** and other companies.

* The conductors of the  Age  are evidently not aware of what has taken place recently in the **British** Dominions.

* Up to a very recent date, the  Hansard  of the **British** Parliament was compiled, printed, and issued by private contract; but there is now being established a State  Hansard,  to which there are to be appointed eleven reporters to record the proceedings of the House of Commons alone.

* This state of affairs prevails throughout the **British** Isles.

* A gentleman by the name of Wakefield was sent out to South Australia by the **British** Government for the purpose of organizing that Crown Colony, and preparing it for selfgovernment which was pending.

* While yet it was a Crown Colony, the **British** Government granted to a combine one of the most gigantic concessions that has ever been granted in the history of Australia.

* The **British** Government did this without knowing what it was doing.

* The **British** authorities have informed us' that the time has now arrived when the necessities of the Empire call for the withdrawal of its Fleet from all those naval bases which they formerly occupied, and for the concentration of its mighty Navy close to the heart of the Empire.

* In future, therefore, we cannot hope to receive from the **British** Fleet the protection that we have enjoyed since we first contributed to the Naval Subsidy.

* So it is with this portion of the **British** Empire.

* Surely such a conglomeration of principles has never been witnessed in any other part of the **British** Dominions.

* There is no doubt that every ' important city in the **British** Empire will be illuminated upon the evening of the Coronation Day, and the amount provided for in the Bill is to meet the Commonwealth's share of the expense.

* My right honorable friend,  Sir Edward  Braddon, just now made a very apt interjection, by reminding me of the **British** representative contingent which was sent here by Great Britain.

* She sent a contingent here representing in the most striking and picturesque form - as I say again, without regard to expense - not only the great regiments of England, Ireland, and Scotland, but also her forces in the rest of the Empire, and no one, I think, who saw them will forget the dash and the gallant bearing of those Indian soldiers who came here with their **British** comrades.

* I would urge the Treasurer to grant a slight preference to **British** imports.

* We needed no despatch from  Mr. Chamberlain  to remind us what the request of the **British** Government then preferred had been.

* The principle, as I took occasion to say the other night - and the right honorable gentleman did me the favour of reading a portion of the quotation I then used - was that the **British** Government sympathizes entirely with our object.

* The **British** Government sympathizing with our object, which was prohibition, suggested a means - the educational test.

* The **British** Government having agreed in its prior despatches in sympathizing with our aim of prohibition, the question of means was secondary.

* According to the press the action of the Government in regard to these men is causing the **British** Empire to totter to its ruin ; but I do not believe there were 1,000 people in England who discussed the matter.

* It enabled the press to cable Home that representative **British** citizens had been refused admission to Australia, and I doubt whether the people at Home have yet been informed that these men were really not refused admission.

* In -31 years the Australian people have paid no less a sum than 103,000,000 to the **British** money holder without in any way lessening their indebtedness to him.

* According to the statistics for 1901, the people of the Commonwealth pay annually to the **British** money lender 13,039,000 in interest.

* According to  Coghlan  the **British** money lender has received from Australia 56,000,000 more than he has advanced.

* It would not be competent for the Imperial Parliament to prescribe that the seal of the Imperial Government should, without any proof, be recognised throughout the **British** Possessions.

* In 1887, when the existing agreement was under the consideration of the Victorian Assembly,  Mr. Gillies,  the then Premier, explained the negotiations which had led to the drawing up of the Bill, and stated that he had agreed to the subsidizing of an auxiliary squadron manned by **British** officers and men, because the Australian colonies  were not united, and could neither finance nor control a navy of their own.

* The leader of the Opposition has expressed fear of the consequences of any departure from the ordinary practices observed in the administration of **British** justice.

* We must remember, however, that the ComptrollerGeneral is responsible to his political head, who, in turn, is responsible  to Parliament; and there is always the protection of that sense of justice which prevails in every **British** community.

* The high salaries paid to officers - higher than are given in any other portion of" the **British** Empire - and the allowances now made, will not be continued.

* Whatever concerns the **British** Empire in its broadest sense equally concerns Australia and the Australians.

* It does not give our New Zealand and Australian fellowcountrymen the sense of personal interest, of personal possession, in the **British** Navy, which I most of all desiderate for the future ; and I want not only the Colonial Governments to understand that on the naval protection of the Empire, exercised through a wise naval strategy, depends our future existence as a united Empire, but I want them to regard the navy as their own - atleast, as much as ours - and with that object I wish to see in the navy more colonial officers and a contribution of colonial seamen.

* It is sheer hypocrisy for honorable members to stand on the floor of this House and- let it go forth to **British** immigrants that there is land in abundance available in Australia, when they know that those Crown lands are so difficult to work at first that only the man with capita!

* The honorable member for Dalley has pointed to the many beneficent Acts that have been passed by the **British** Parliament in order to remedy Irish grievances, and to the fact that they have not proved effective.

* Whenever' any question affecting Ireland is brought forward for discussion, the English majority - as distinct from the **British** majority - oppose everything that is advocated by the representatives of Ireland, thereby making null and void the Irish representation.

* That is one of the reasons why Irish national sentiment has not found full expression in the **British** Parliament.

* The English prejudice is represented by the peer, the parson, and the publican- the three great controlling elements in **British** politics which regulate the national sentiment of Great Britain.

* It is notorious that at one time the **British** Parliament desired us to separate from the Crown.

* Is the honorable member for Dalley aware of the fact that Ulster has always returned a majority of Home Rulers to the **British** Parliament ?

* There can be no combination between the various nationalities of the **British** Empire until they have first secured!

* If we could see a reasonable prospect of a great AngloCeltic Federation by the dismemberment of the **British** Empire, dear though the Empire is to us, the sacrifice would be small compared with the gain in the interests of humanity.

* The honorable member will recognise that in order to secure a union between Great Britain and the United States of America it would be necessary for the **British** people to part with their Imperial sentiment, while the Americans would have to part with their Republican sentiment; but if, between the two, we could arrive at a common basis of union, where the best of our Imperial sentiment and the best of the Republican sentiment of the Americans would be conserved, we should secure a higher and better type of federation.

* I have no doubt that the honorable member for 
I am responsible for the terms of the motion to a greater extent than is any other honorable member, and I say, with all earnestness, that there is no one in the **British** Empire whom I esteem more highly for his liberal opinions, and his broad-minded sympathy with the people of various nationalities in the Empire, than King Edward VII.

* It has also been stated that some of us were trailing our coats before the **British** Government, and we have also been accused of shaking our puny fists in the face of Great Britain.

* It could be shown from these documents that members of the present Government were among the loudest in their denunciations of these frippery proposals, as they were called, and that they clamoured for some strong action that would convey to the **British** Government what we wanted and that we meant what we said.

* The AttorneyGeneral told us that if we, a comparatively small portion of the **British** Empire, approached Japan and India by proposals for treaties, the Governments of those countries would consent to keep their people at home.

* It is our duty to look after the interests of this portion of the Empire, and while we are glad to have the protection of the **British** fleet - and I hope we shall always have it - we can carry out our responsibilities to the people of this continent better than the people at Home can do.

* Mr. Chamberlain  would have allowed what is vulgarly termed a "land grab" to take place in **British** New Guinea but for the strong protest that we made at this end of the world.

* There is, therefore, not very much reason to fear that because of some action taken in a far-off portion of the mighty Empire the **British** relations with Japan will be ruptured.

* As evidencing how thoroughly the **British** Parliament dealt with these matters, I may mention still another example which is to be found in an Act relating to the manufacture of pins.

* His proposals do the **British** Government enormous credit ficm a Democratic stand-point.

* The leader of the Opposition said that if he were governed by **British** precedent he would refuse to impose any further burdens upon the people.

* Of course, we have to remember that this memorial is intended to be expressive of the sentiment, not merely of the great self-governing communities in the **British** Empire, but also of the peoples of the whole of the late Queen's domain, including the great Empire of Hindustan, and also other far less civilized races to whom, as the "Great White Queen," she was a figure of surpassing interest and influence.

* It is true that these can te transferred to many parts of the globe; but all the **British** Fleet is not retained, and is rarely seen, even in **British** waters.

* There at the very centre of its life, receiving through manifold arteries the blood that flows from all portions of that great organism which we name the **British** Empire, they are little conscious of how much of their welfare and of the power they possess is due to that which they receive from us; just as we, remote from the great populations of the old world, and having but scanty visible connexion even with the mother country, are often apt to undervalue the protection which is afforded by the power and prowess of the motherland.

* Whatever the cost may be, I would rather that we owned two
                or three vessels than that we paid any subsidy to the **British** Government for the use
                of vessels over which we have no control.

* When I hear honorable members talking glibly
                about rendering assistance to the Empire generally, and of the supremacy of the
                **British** navy, I am led to speculate whether they have ever really considered the
                question at all.

* It is
                quite reasonable to suppose that these vessels will be successful, and- if they are,
                it behoves us to consider what, is the value of the **British** navy.

* The **British** navy
                in such circumstances would become practically valueless.

* Yes ; but the submarine boats at present in the **British** navy are a mere
                nothing compared with those invented by the French nation.

* If he believes, as I do, that it is to the interest of the **British** people, or those who come of **British** stock, to stand by each other, and to form one world-wide organism, his views will, of necessity, be Imperial ; but if he believes that colonies tend naturally and inevitably towards separation and independence, or if, in addition, he desires to hasten the process of disintegration, his views will, with equal necessity, be local and national.

* In all our colonies it must be admitted there are men who desire separation, men who grow restive under the gossamer ties which connect them with the Motherland and with other **British** communities.

* If my argument be right, it is surely the duty of all **British** people to stand shoulder to shoulder to strengthen by all possible means the cohesion which circumstances and our own culpable neglect have allowed to become relaxed, and to refrain from any policy - and, I think, the proposal to create a Colonial Navy is a case in point - which would tend to the further division of our already scattered forces.

* We have at present people of **British** stock  - our own flesh and blood - acting in co-operation with us.

* We are all in favour of co-operation ; and there can be only one consideration which would induce a man on reflection to refuse to take the necessary steps to bring about naval co-operation, and that is the consideration that we are bound eventually, and  that  it is wise for the Australian people,, to step out of the **British** Empire ?

* If he believes, as I do, that it is to the interest of the **British** people, or those who come of **British** stock, to standby each other, and to form one world-wide organism, his views will, of necessity, be Imperial; but if he believes that Colonies tend' naturally and inevitably towards separation and independence; or if," in addition, hedesires to hasten the process of disintegration, his views will, with equal necessity, be local and national.

* The old rate of duty was  25  per cent, on wrought iron pipes, but under the present Tariff the rates are  30  and  25  per cent, on both wrought iron and cast iron pipes, there being a preference of  5  per cent, in favour of the **British** manufacturer.

* would he vote for a reduction of duty on **British** goods if their importation would prejudicially affect an Australian manufacture.

* That was tantamount to a declaration that he is in favour of absolutely excluding **British** goods from this market, because any importation must prejudicially affect local manufactures.

* The old Tariff provided for a 15 per cent, duty, and under the Tariff now before us imports from foreign countries will be liable to a duty of 35 per cent., whilst **British** imports will be dutiable at 30 per cent.

* As a matter of fact this higher duty is desired simply to prevent the product of **British** manufacturers - the result of the labour of **British** workmen - from having a fair opportunity to compete in the.

* Recognising what the mother country has done, and is doing, for us - recognising that she is protecting this Continent, and preserving it to us in order that we may develop our industriesin peace - I am sure that the majority of the people, if appealed to, would declare that, despite the opinions of a few manufacturers to the contrary, the time had not yet come when **British** manufactures should not be allowed to compete in the Australian market.

* So that for every100 worth of goods produced in Australia the value of the labour is 30, as against 20 paid by the **British** manufacturer.

* The total disability of the Australian woollen manufacturer compared with his **British** competitor is, therefore, on these findings, not more than 2 per cent, on equipment, and 10 per cent, on labour, or a total of 12 per cent, on the value of the product.

* As against this, the **British** manufacturer who competes in Australia pays 15 per cent, duty, and from 7 to 12 per cent, charges, or a minimum total of 22 per cent, on his goods, and this, without taking into consideration an average increase in the cost of Australian wool, delivered at the mill in England, of16 per cent.

* Thus we have under this Tariff a total protection of 55 per cent, against foreign importations, and of 50 per cent, in the case of **British** imports.

* The effect of the new Tariff has been to raise the duty on our raw material, woollen piece goods, to 30 per cent, on the **British** and 35 per cent, on the foreign article.

* As against this, the duty on the manufactured article is unchanged, and still remains at 30 per cent, on **British** goods, with an extra 5 per cent, on those of foreign manufacture Now, manufactured caps are almost exclusively imported from Great Britain, but, on the other hand, we are compelled to go to Germany, Belgium, or France for our raw material, which, in consequence, bears the higher rate of 35 per cent.

* In nearly every instance the witness clearly indicated that no preference should be given by Australia to Great Britain until the duty had been fixed at such a rate as to secure to Australian manufacturers the Commonwealth market with a substantial margin of security, even against the competition of **British** manufacturers.

* Is it not the case that most of the socalled preferential duties in this Tariff are intended to largely prohibit the importation of **British** goods, the extra 5 per cent, on foreign importations being merely an ornamental coping?

* The duties on **British** manufactures are so high as to practically prevent their importation into Australia, and the extra 5 per cent, against the foreigner is merely ornamental, and, furthermore, is imposed on many items in regard to which there is no foreign importation.

* The, duties on mining machinery, textiles, and woollens are so high as to practically prohibit **British** importations, and it is from Great Britain that in the past such goods have chiefly come.

* The additional rate of 5 per cent, against the foreigner is a mere make-believe preference to the **British** manufacturer.

* I have already pointed out that the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission has announced his intention not to vote for any reduction of duty, even on **British** goods, whose importation is prejudicial to Australian manufacture, and, as I have said, any importation must be prejudicial to some extent to the local manufacturers of goods of the kinds imported.

* The duties on **British** goods are such as will prevent them from competing against local manufacturers in this market.

* But I shall show the position which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer put before the **British** people when in England in connexion with the Imperial Conference.

* All of these would be purchasers of **British** goods, far larger purchasers than foreigners are, and of the goods you most wish to sell.

* The Prime Minister spoke of our people being purchasers of **British** goods.

* Now, as regards the modes of preference to **British** goods, it is obvious that the Commonwealth may proceed either to lower existing duties in favour of Great Britain, or to increase these duties to the foreigner.

* **British** goods.

* There is not a word there about increasing the duties on **British** goods.

* The report continues - 
I am assured by an authority that a substantial preference to the goods of Great Britain in our markets would result in an increase of **British** trade with Australia to the extent of perhaps 50 per cent.

* We can imagine what a howl would come from those interested in the woollen and other industries who have been clamouring for more protection if the present rates were reduced to give a real preference to **British** manufacturers, and the result were to increase the importation of **British** goods by 50 per cent.

* Colonies would mean the employment of millions more Britons in your Colonies and increased markets for **British** manufactures.

* Increased markets not for colonial but for **British** manufactures.

* As soon as he returned to Australia, he submitted a Tariff which will prevent **British** goods coming into Australia and competing on fair terms with our own products.

* I hope that **British** statesmen will note what is occurring at the present time in the Australian Parliament.

* Those who posed before the people of Great Britain as ardent supporters of preferential trade were prepared to make glib promises in the old land as to the grand markets that would be opened up for (**British** manufactures in Australia; but as soon as they returned, they changed their tune, and began at once to pander to the desires of Australian manufacturers, and to yield to the dictates of a section of the press.

* The first Constitution in the world, the **British**, is not written, and sets no limits to the powers of the people.

* I do not know whether honorable members appreciate the extent to which the **British** Parliament is sovereign.

* When I heard the Prime Minister say that the States would have no guarantee that we should not repudiate the agreement, I do not know whether he remembered the powers of the **British** Parliament.

* Do honorable members realize that the **British** Parliament could within twenty-four hours declare that King Edward was no longer King, and put plain John Smith in his place?

* Do they realize that if necessary every article of the Act of Union between England and Scotland could be repudiated to-morrow if the **British** Parliament liked?

* One Act, indeed, of the **British** Parliament might, looked at in the light of history, claim a peculiar sanctity.

* From the time that Act was passed until now no attempt has been made by the **British** Parliament to infringe it, but it is competent for that Parliament to-morrow to impose a tax upon every person in Australia, Canada, or the West Indies.

* The things that the **British** Parliament might do, and does not do, are staggering.

* Dicey  says, on page  76 - 
Parliament might legally establish an Episcopal Church in Scotland; Parliament might legally tax the Colonies; Parliament might without any breach of law change the succession to the throne or abolish the monarchy; but every one knows that in the present state of the world the **British** Parliament will do none of these things.

* That should be the right of every **British** citizen.

* Most of our cargoes are carried in **British** bottoms ; and in this connexion serious questions arise.

* The **British** Govern- ment quite recently has been considering the effect of the immense increase of foreign sailors on **British** shipping; and the important bearing of this phase of the question will be seen if honorable members will permit me to quote some figures prepared by the **British** Board of Trade.

* In i860, **British** shipping was represented by 4.500,000 tons, while in 1903, the tonnage was 10,250,000.

* In 1860, there were engaged on **British** shipping 157,000 seamen, exclusive"' of masters, while in 1903 there were only .176,000, including masters.

* i860, there were 335 lascars employed irc **British** shipping, as compared' with 41,000 in 1903.

* In i860, there were 14,000 foreigners engaged on **British** shipping, as against 40,000 in 1:903.

* As a matter of fact, between i860 and 1903, **British** seamen increased by only- 12 per cent., while foreigners, exclusive of lascars, increased 175 per cent.

* I should like to quote the remarks of the  President  of the Board of Trade, made in the **British** House of Commons, as showing the serious import of this matter to the welfare of the country.

* The  President  of the Board of Trade used the following words : - 
Take, for instance, the question of war; if thereservists were called out, the result would beto deplete **British** ships of **British** seamen,, and, instead of being partially manned byforeigners, they would, under existing circumstances, be altogether manned by foreigners.

* The defence of every country depends onpatriotism - on the spirit of those who- formthe defence forces - and in time of war weshould have the present **British** shipping manned entirely by foreigners, who could' not be expected to have any love for the country for which they were temporarily working.

* I recognise the importance of naval defence, but I want to leave the **British** ships free to operate in any .part of the world where it is deemed expedient that they should be, and to make our local defence as effective as possible.

* He remarked that the **British** taxpayer had to contribute approximately 13,000,000 annually towards the 
**British** Navy.

* He said, further, that the **British** taxpayer paid 30,000,000 per annum for the maintenance of the army and navy.

* Does any one think that all the anxiety now being displayed would be shown for the sake of securing a grant of 200,000 a year, when the total expenditure upon the **British** Navy is 39,000,000?

* He says - 
The Admiralty have accepted the responsibility for protecting all **British** territory abroad against organized attack by sea, they go on to recognise that, while  His  Majesty's ships are engaged in destroying or disabling the enemy's squadrons, they may not always be in a position to prevent raids by hostile cruisers, their objects being to destroy shipping, or other accessible property of value, especially naval and mercantile marine resources, such as docks, repairing shops, storehouses, jetties, cranes, and coaling appliances ; to seize coal or stores which might be urgently required ; to levy a money contribution, or even merely to create alarm, and obtain a prestige which might appear to attach .to an operation of no real military importance whatever.

* The same gentleman also urges that a North Sea fleet should be provided for the purpose of always cruising in **British** waters.

* Absolute and complete dependence by Australia upon the **British** Navy, situated as we are, at the extremity of the Empire, will add to that strain.

* In three years' time, on the expiration by notice of the present subsidy 106,000 would become available for the rental by Australia, and commission with Australian crews, of three more cruisers hired from the **British** Government.

* Senator Matheson assumes that the **British** Government would be willing to hire out vessels if provision were made for interest, sinking fund, and maintenance.

* The presence of a High Commissioner in London" will give the **British** people a much better idea of the importance of Australia than they have now.

* The  Australian Leather Trade Journal  shows that, whilst the **British** workmen are literally starving, the **British** Government, true to its policy, is sending its army contracts to India, to have boots made by workmen paid at rates ranging from 6Jd.

* The  Leather Trade Journal  says - 
Indian  versus  **British** Boots for the Army.

* My remedy for this condition of things would be, not a charity list, but the employment of the **British** workmen to make the boots for the Army, or the manufacture of the boots in India under similar conditions to those which would have to be complied with if **British** workmen were employed.

* I am aware that, according to the rules of procedure established in the **British** Parliament, the position appointed for the  Speaker,  together with other members of this House, on such an occasion, is at the Bar of another place.

* A number of small crosses here and there indicate " Here lies a **British** soldier."

* They made a big outcry about the fact that when slavery was being abolished by the **British** Empire they got only some 40 or 50 a head for their slaves, while they wanted a great deal more.

* When they saw that slavery was to be a thing of the past in the **British** dominions, they decided, holding their own peculiar views in regard to the natives, that they would go further north where they could work their own sweet will with the black people.

* They went up into a part of the country which at that time was occupied by native races, and which was also to a certain extent under the control and regulation of the **British** Government.

* The **British** Government had continually taken an interest in the various native tribes, and, as far as possible, helped them along the paths of civilization.

* In that respect it is impossible for any one, whatever may be the shortcomings of the **British** Government, to charge them with indifference to the welfare of native races.

* We have heard that complaint frequently in Australia, and it was certainly voiced in no quiet way by the Boers time and again, when the **British** Government interfered to prevent their maltreating, robbing, and enslaving the natives by whom they were surrounded.

* But whoever was at fault, the **British** Government could not continue to see this state of things going on without attempting to put matters right.

* We find the **British** Government continually using their influence, but quite without avail until a time came when the Boers were actually threatened with extinction by the great Zulu nation, which had rapidly risen to a foremost place amongst the natives of Africa.

* When the real position was understood the Boer leaders immediately cast about for relief, and, as on previous occasions, they approached the **British** Government.

* Their usual course of action was to argue that in times of peace they should be left severely alone, and allowed to do what they chose to the natives, but when their conduct provoked retaliation, they should be at liberty to seek refuge behind the **British** authorities.

* The Boers were perfectly sure that they had annihilated the greater part of the **British** army, and were merely waiting their own time to drive the **British** entirely out of the country.

* His reply to that was - " You are all alike, tarred with the same brush ; you are all **British** in your hearts."

* That, spoken in relation to the position of the Boers under the **British** Government, indicates clearly the opinion of that authority that sovereignty did exist in actual and tangible fashion.

* I am  perfectly  willing to admit that capitalists have taken the side of the **British** in this war ; but I hope it will be admitted that capitalists have also been taking the side of the Boers.

* Is it not the doing away with a condition of things that makes representative Government merely a farce, and is it not such a struggle as that which was entered upon in the Transvaal by the Uitlanders  1  Was it not for that purpose that **British** arms entered that country  1  I think it would be very hard to prove the opposite.

* Does the honorable member think the **British** Government would be justified in giving votes to people who have been following a policy of retrogression and corruption which they have stuck to through thick and thin, through right and wrong, up to the present time  1 
Think of the fact that the experts of the **British** Army will not allow Australian leather to be used.

* I believe that if it were known, as it must become known, "that this Parliament, not by a catch vote, but by an overwhelming majority, demanded that these conditions should be carried out in connexion with the mail contracts, no **British** Government, in the face of the experience of the past - which has taught the **British** Empire what it needed to be taught in respect to the government of its colonies - - would ever dare to veto such a provision.

* Because of that, and because there seems, even according to the statement of the AttorneyGeneral, no good and sufficient reason why the amendment as proposed by  me  should not be adopted, I, for my part, do npt care to postpone the matter, and I, therefore, move - 
That the following word's be added as a proviso to clause 14 : - "Provided that no contract or  arrangement  shall be entered into with any person or corporation that directly or indirectly employs other than white **British** subjects in the carrying out of such contract or arrangement."

* **British** manufacturers have, so far, been importing, wood pulp from Sweden, where there are extensive softwood forests.

* They must view them not from the Australian point of view alone, and not from the **British** point alone, but from the view of the Empire as a whole.

* In Australia in ten years the imports of **British** goods had declined by1,  000,000  a year - our foreign imports had increased by5,000,000.

* Why should we not become larger customers for **British** goods.

* I am prepared to increase the duties which we levy upon the productions of foreign countries proportionately as we reduce them upon **British** goods.

* I am wholly in sympathy with the declaration of the Prime Minister at the last election that we owe something to the Empire in the matter of her trade relations with, us, altogether apart from the question of the national protection which we enjoy at the hands of the **British** Navy.

* He has pretty well covered the ground, and in my opinion has given very satisfactory reasons why action should be taken to bring the islands of the New Hebrides under **British** control.

* Had action been taken at the proper time in respect of New Guinea, the whole of that island would have been under **British** control.

* Above the table is a note indicating that the figures include - 
Imports which have been transhipped to other States and to oversea countries, and although it includes produce grown by foreign settlers, the figures could be taken as a fair approximation of the value of the surplus products grown by **British** residents for export, as French vessels also carry produce of **British** subjects to New Caledonia, which would about equalize matters.

* The facts constitute sufficient reason for some action, and I hope that the Prime Minister will communicate with the Secretary of State for the Colonies with a view to negotiations with France, so that these islands may be brought under **British** control.

* I have no desire to obtain local option in **British** New Guinea, because I recognise that it is impracticable.

* If the white population of **British** New Guinea is composed entirely of miners, and the white residents do all the drinking, the miners are about the heaviest tipplers upon this mundane sphere.

* What has occurred there will unmistakably happen in **British** New Guinea.

* If the miners of **British** New Guinea consume all the liquor which is imported there, .

* There is an old axiom, with which we are all familiar, that " delay is the fundamental principle of the **British** Constitution."

* right in saying, "  Mr. Deakin  sends this message to **British**, merchants and supporters of preference," and then quoting as coming from the honorable gentleman these words - 
The right honorable member states that the present regulation is enforced in every **British** community.

* If he could not find a precedent in the **British** House of Commons, or somewhere else iri the **British** Empire, for a proposal, he would regard it as an excellent reason for voting against it.

* **British** manufacturers, have for many yearstried in vain tocutintothetrade,but they have been unable to obtain the secret of the dyeing of the goods.

* against foreign importations, and of  12  per cent, against **British** importations.

* If they had to choose between indefinite delay and abandoning the cry for further inquiry they would be only too glad to adopt the latter course, profiting by what we know of history and the record of **British** people in the sister federation of Canada.

* It is only 'the scum of the **British** race who will live in the stoke-holes of steamers in the Red Sea.

* That is the contract for which  Mr. Chamberlain  is asking millions of people to impose taxes on the free passage of the life blood of **British** industry.

* Why is there a duty of 30 per cent, on **British** boots and hats, and a duty of 25 per cent, on clothes made in England?

* They speak of the call of  Mr. Chamberlain  with regard to reciprocal trade - remember not preferential treatment as between **British** and foreign countries - but reciprocal trade between Englishmen and Australians.

* I will now read a telegram which the same conference sent to  Mr. Chamberlain,  showing the way in which this ready, noble, brotherly assent is given to this gigantic scheme to tax the bread of the **British** millions.

* Politicians may twist and turn, but when the Australian people talk to the **British** people across the ocean they do not desire to speak in terms of deception and imposition.

* I have found a copy of the condition to which I referred last night as included in a **British** contract.

* I should have said that it was included in a draft contract, submitted to us by the **British** Government, which arrived just before the publication of our advertisement for tenders for the present mail service.

* I will read the condition, so that honorable members may see how closely it has been followed in article 36 of the proposed contract - 
Both are postal contracts, but, while the Admiralty is to act for the **British** Government, the PostmasterGeneral is to act for this Government, as we have no Admiralty Department.

* The matter is of importance only as showing that we were correct in claiming to have followed a **British** precedent.

* This is the latest **British** precedent obtainable.

* The action of the Opposition might be all right, viewed from the stand-point of the Tammany Hall bludgers or the sand-baggers of Pennsylvania or the Louisiana  Kuklux  clans, but it is altogether out of place in a **British** Legislature.

* Ever since I have been here, **British** institutions have been held up to me as the glorious apotheosis of liberty and righteousness.

* A woman who, not being a **British** subject, marries a **British** subject, shall in the Commonwealth be deemed to be thereby naturalized, nnd have the same rights and privileges, and be subject to the same obligations, as a person who has obtained a certificate of naturalization.

* An infant, not being a natural-born **British** subject - 
whose mother is married to a natural-born **British** subject or to a person who has obtained a certificate of naturalization ; and who lias at any time resided in Australia with such father or mother, shall in the Commonwealth be deemed to be naturalized and have the same rights and privileges, and be subject to the same obligations as a person who has obtained a certificate of naturalization.

* I want to make sure that we do not give a sham preference, or a preference which is actually in favour of the foreign against the **British** article, as to goods that, must and will be imported.

* This stipulation as to weight shuts out the **British** and lets in the foreign article.

* Then the importers of these goods are equally mistaken, because they have assured me- - and have furnished samples to back up their  statement - that the item as it is worded will shut out the **British** article, and let in foreign goods.

* If the Treasurer would make the weight provision 8 ozs., so as to equalize conditions between French and **British** manufacturers, I should have nothing more to say.

* I ask the Minister of Defence whether he has yet selected the names for the new destrovers of the River class,and whether he proposes to follow the **British** precedent of giving them the names of rivers?

* When I had the honour of being a representative in Great Britain two or three years ago, a most distinguished statesman took advantage of a public occasion to impress on us all the duty which he said we owed to the mother country of making a large contribution to the military and naval expenditure, and becoming a partner in the burdens of the **British** Empire.

* I ventured to say in the same distinguished company that it was time the **British** people thoroughly under stood the state of Australian feeling - that we out in these far lands, in developing the resources of this great continent, were doing a far greater duty and rendering a more valuable service to the **British** Empire than we should do by any pecuniary contribution to the military chest of Great Britain.

* This contribution, which would be insignificant in the vast total of **British** expenditure, might to us be a source of embarrassment, and might derange our finances so as to cause a state of feeling which no lover of the **British** connexion could wish to see developed.

* I thought 1 had performed a public service in letting the **British** Government and the **British** public know the true state of affairs.

* With reference to that remarkable struggle, that painful struggle - because Britishers as we are, and loyal as we are, there is a grandeur about the courage which animates these Boers which no man can affect to disparage - one of the great lessons they have taught Great Britain - a lesson sadly needed - is that the whole genius of the administration of the **British** army must be changed.

* We must remember that if there is a community of communities which down to its furthest extremity should be alive to the wants of to-day, it is that wonderful series of communities which form this **British** Empire.

* We may feel proud of the mighty strength of the **British** Empire, but the task we have now at once to perform is to provide for the internal defence of this Commonwealth.

* **British**, troops, were withdrawn from these colonies, and we weretold " You may depend upon our fleets, but no longer upon our soldiers ; you must arm and defend your own shores."

* At the same time if any emergency comes when the motherland isbest with danger, it will ever, I trust, be found that we are ready to shed out blood in defence of her, not only for her own sake, but because she and we are associated, and our institutions are guaranteed by the strength and glory of the **British** Empire.

* Subject to this Act the laws in force in the Possession of **British** New Guinea at the commencement of this Act shall continue in the Territory until other provision is made.

* But when we come to the conditions of the agreement, whilst I hold that South Australia should be recouped its expenditure, and even a fair portion of the accumulated deficiency - for although I do not think that it recouped the **British** Govenment any potion of its accumulated deficiency when it took over the Territory, I am willing to concede that.

* I know that the **British** Government made a number of costly experiments, which resulted in failure.

* True, a duty of from 20 to 25 per cent, is to be put upon woollen and silk apparel, and one of 10 to 15 per cent, upon cottons and linens ; but this ought not to enable the Australian manufacturer to keep out the wares of his **British** competitors.

* Much capital is already invested in Melbourne in this industry ; and I, along with other honorable members, have visited the works of the **British** Imperial OilCompany, and seen the whole process.

* The **British** Imperial Oil Company, to which I refer, has made as good a fight as it possibly could against the largest Trust in the world; and I point out that the duty is not really on the oil, but on the tins and cases.

* and endeavoured to ' bring about the defeat of the **British** ImperialOil Company.

* The **British** Imperial Oil Company, on the other hand, provide employment for Australian workmen.

* Surely we ought to stand by the **British** Imperial Oil Company, and refuse to allow it to be crushed by the greatest combine in the world?

* The Duke of Devonshire made a statement some two or three years ago in the course of a great fiscal debate, that preference such as was suggested would mean an advantage to the self-governing Dominions of one and a half millions, but would cost the **British** consumer10.000,000.

* That is to say, the self-governing Colonies would derive an advantage of 1,500,000, but the **British** consumer would have to pay 10,000,000.

* Sir Albert  Spicer added - 
If so, will he cause the papers relating tosuch claim to be made available to members prior to asking the House to vote moneys for the maintenance of the **British** New Guinea Civil Service?

* The motion asks us to affirm that now, and for all time, we shall discard the idea of the formation of an Australian Navy, and rest our hope of naval defence entirely upon the **British** Squadron.

* As far back as 1885, the **British** Admiralty advised the various Colonies - as they were at that time - to acquire a fleet for local defence purposes.

* Nobody knows better than does the honorable member that there is no bigger blundering machine in the world than is the **British** War Office.

* It is safe to assume, however, that if a naval war occurred, we should have a repetition of the blunders which have characterized the **British** War Office.

* From my earliest boyhood I have heard the bombastic statement that the **British** Army can beat any two or three other armies combined, and that the **British** Navy can defeat any two or three other naval Powers acting in combination.

* when **British** statesmanship and **British** diplomacy were not what they are to-day, I say that the assumption that the mother country requires to maintain a fleet equal to that of an two or three Powers combined is utterly ridiculous.

* We had a visit some time ago from a gentleman who claimed to be the envoy of the Imperial Navy League, and he came to Australia with the object of arousing in the minds of the Australian people interest in the **British** Navy.

* I do not wish to criticise  Mr. Wyatt  more than to say that if the **British** Navy League wished to recommend their cause to the Australian people, they did not select the right man to advocate it.

* I have admitted that our general safety is at present secured by the presence of the **British** Fleet in Australian waters ; but, in maintaining that fleet, Great Britain does no more than her duty to her Colonies.

* The **British** Fleet is in our waters not wholly in the interests of Australia.

* I do not suppose that the honorable member will dispute the statement that the **British** money lord is the chief power behind the Government of Great Britain.

* Therefore, notwithstanding the advantages gained by Australia from the presence of the **British** Fleet in these waters, it must be admitted that it is maintained here not wholly for our benefit, and the people of Great Britain gain, I believe, the major advantage.

* If during the next few years, while we have no navy of our own, there should be a naval war in which Great Britain is involved, I would make one to ask the Australian people to subscribe, not a few thousand pounds, but 000,000 or 2,000,000, to replace any **British** war vessels that may be lost in our defenceIt is not because I wish the Australian people  to  look at this question merely from a mercenary point of view, but because I wish them to take upon themselves the duties of nationhood that I have moved the amendment, which I believe to be more in keeping with their aspirations than is the motion.

* We are experiencing, on a small scale, the difficulties that English statesmen have always encountered, in dealing with the affairs of a country like India, or with other parts of the **British** dominions in which there is a large native population.

* We should be thankful that the **British** Government are content to furnish us with this protection, as part of their larger scheme for the defence of the Empire.

* At page xxxiii we find the following statement:' - 
Under the War Office management, muzzle-loading rifles were being used by **British** soldiers twenty-five years after breech-loading guns, and even magazine rifles, were in common use by sportsmen and others ; and the English Navy did not use steel for the construction of hulls until long after steel ships were common in the merchant service.

* We are paying too much for our insurance, and when we discuss the Estimates in detail I shall take every opportunity to reduce or strike out the items which I regard as unnecessary 
On dutiable goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, and imported direct in **British** ships.

* of white **British** seamen " be inserted.

* At the present time, there are, on the average, on every **British** vessel, about six Britishers to four foreigners; I propose that there shall be eight Britishers to two foreigners.

* If the Committee agrees to the amendment, it will practically re-enact a provision formerly in force in Great Britain, which I believe did a great deal to build up the **British** mercantile marine.

* me to be contrary to the accepted principles of **British** law.

* The lamentable state of affairs which exists in regard to the **British** mercantile marine, and, in the eyes of every patriotic Englishman, must seem pregnant with the direst and gravest possibilities.

* If the displacement of **British** by foreign seamen proceeds at the present rate, the former will be unknown twenty years hence.

* According to the Board of Trade returns, while the population of Great Britain between 1890 and 1900 increased by something like 10 per cent., and the tonnage of **British** vessels by 26 per cent., the number of foreigners, exclusive of Asiatics, employed on them increased by more than 35 per cent., and the number of Asiatics byover 58 per cent., the number of Britishers so employed have decreased by about 6 per cent.

* The amount of capital invested in English shipping is so stupendous that no other **British** industry compares with the shipping industry.

* The preferential proposals now before the Chamber are opposed to both the free-trade and the protectionist policy, and the only motive actuating the Government in bringing them forward must be a desire to promote closer relations between the various parts of the Empire, for the benefit of the **British** race.

* But if these proposals do not promote closer relations and do not promote the welfare of the **British** race, such a departure from the timehonoured policy under which our Colonial Empire has been built up is unjustifiable and inexcusable.

* The honorable member for Kalgoorlie wishes to check the lamentable falling off in the number of Britishers employed in **British** vessels.

* I mav be told that fewer Britishers find employment on **British** ships because more profitable occupation can be obtained ashore.

* But in Germany, France, and other European, countries there has been a tendency of late to improve the conditions under which men work ashore, and the difference between the lot of a Britisher afloat in a **British** vessel and ashore in Great Britain is no greater than the difference between the lot of a German afloat in a German vessel and ashore in Germany.

* Therefore, what is true of the **British** mercantile marine should hold good in regard to the mercantile marine of other nations ; but it does not.

* In no other than the **British** mercantile marine does there exist such a state of things as we deplore, and as patriotic citizens and intelligent men, we ought to do what we can to alter it.

* If we say that preference shall not be given in respect of goods imported in **British** ships which are not manned exclusively by **British** seamen, Great Britain will not benefit in the slightest by these proposals, because hardly one English vessel manned exclusively by Britishers comes here from the mother country iri a year.

* According to the Board of Trade returns the number of **British** persons employed on **British** vessels in 1900, not including lascars, was 174,532, and of foreign persons so employed 36,893, or 21.14 per cent.

* The total number of persons serving on **British** ships, including lascars and foreigners, was 247,448, of which only 174,532 were Britishers.

* On every **British** vessel coming here there are, on an average, six Britishers to four foreigners.

* As a matter of fact, since the **British** fishing fleet is manned almost exclusively by Britishers, the percentage of foreigners on ocean-going **British** ships is higher than I have stated, practically half the men so employed being foreigners.

* Therefore,  o  refuse to give a preference in respect to goods carried on other than **British** vessels manned exclusively by Britishers would be equivalent to throwing the Bill under the table.

* If my honorable friend wishes to da something to reduce the percentage of foreigners employed in the **British** mercantile marine, he should alter his amendment to provide for the employment of 80 per cent, of Britishers upon **British** ships carrying goods in respect to which preference is claimed.

* **British** ship-owners might be induced to substitute Britishers for foreigners to the extent of one, two, or three members of their crews, whereas it would be impossible for them to go to the full length now proposed.

* A ship which had a negro cook, or a foreign steward, would be disqualified from carrying **British** preference goods.

* But if we stipulated that 80 per cent, of Britishers should be employed, the condition might tend to the employment of a larger proportion of **British** seamen, and thereby accomplish good.

* The proposed condition that preference goods should be manufactured wholly by white **British** workmen would net operate in one case out of every hundred, for the simple reason that very few coloured men are employed in manufacturing industries of Great Britain.

* If the honorable member for Kalgoorlie will not accept my suggestion, I shall move to insert a provision that the goods in respect of which preference is given shall be carried in **British** ships manned by not less than 80 per cent, of white **British** seamen.

* I wish to see more **British** seamen employed, but the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie would, I am sure, prove ineffective, because the inducement offered to shipowners to effect the necessary change in their crews is not sufficient.

* Any one who knows anything about the tremendous influence and the sphere of operations of the **British** shipping ring must realize that shipowners would not do so much as is required in order to gain so little.

* Because the most objectionable coloured aliens we could have admitted to our shores are the natives of **British** India - our fellow **British** subjects.

* Yet, as **British** subjects, they can only be excluded by means of an educational test such as has been accepted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies as one that may be adopted.

* We have one instance, and, I think, only one instance, of a vote being passed in the **British** House of Commons in favour of woman's suffrage, and that was passed on the motion of and largely by conservatives.

* Whether the whole civilized world will be largely exercised on the subject or not, there will, at any rate, be a very considerable amount of interest taken in the work of this House throughout the whole of the **British** Empire.

* What appears to me to be the "most unkindest cut of all " is a quotation from the report of the Royal Commission sent out by the **British** Government to investigate the cotton-growing possibilities of East Africa.

* The attitude of the Imperial Government towards the Commonwealth and this Parliament in regard to the other **British** Possessions in the seas around us, may, to a great extent, depend on the success with which we administer this, our first, external territory.

* In regard to coffee, the Royal Commission, on page 19 of their report, say - 
Tobacco and sisal hemp are other products which are recommended by the **British** Royal Commission for cultivation in 
Castle".

* to be found with it, as compared with bacon 'cured in the old days with imported 'salt'' '" The Downs Co-operative Dairy ; Company' at the_ exhibition' held'1 recently, in Brisbane, secured the champion prize for butter cured with Australian- salt', -and- at the exhibition held in London- by -the **British** Dairy Farmers' Association !

* ''- ''"j 
How much of the wire netting imported in the year 1904 was of **British** manufacture, and how much was from other parts - specifying the quantity and value from each particular place?

* In the session of 1S71  Mr. Speaker  Cockburn recommended to the House the adoption of **British** practice in this particular, and the Commons have ever since acquiesced in its wisdom.

* In Canada, the Postal department carries all Braille matter free, and I think we shall be following a good example of another **British** Federation if we adopt a similar practice here.

* In investigating this question, I should like to pass in review the different kinds of closure of which we have had some experience in the parliamentary history of the **British** Empire, because I suppose it is even more valuable to discuss methods which have been tried in existing Parliaments than to soar into the air and debate purely theoretical methods.

* Now let us in connexion with the very important question, whether we should apply some method of closure to the remaining business of this Parliament, pause to consider the merits of the **British** form of closure.

* There was an actively disloyal party in the heart of the **British** Empire,' which was trying to rend the Empire asunder - trying to separate one of the vital parts of the United Kingdom from England and Scotland - and they were determined that no business should be transacted until Home Rule was granted to Ireland'.

* One of the reasons why the parliamentary institutions of the mother country have acquired their reputation throughout the world, so that the **British** Parliament, in spite of its privileged orders, and its House of Lords, is looked upon by the reformers of all nations as an example to be copied, is that, although many mighty storms have raged in that august Chamber, strewing it with the wrecks of political fortunes v and political parties, although in its history the fate of empires has been fought out, through all the defeats, and all the victories, there has remained a spirit of freedom, a right to express individual convictions, a power of legitimate difference of opinion, which is reflected in the glorious attributes of the **British** people.

* Because, whatever may be the change which has passed over thousands of the Irish people to-day, at that time the moving power of Home Rule was hatred of England, and a determination to break up the **British** Empire.

* For some years past there has been a growing desire on the part of **British** statesmen to place the incidence of taxation upon a truly scientific basis.

* U  Under  the old system, while retaining our connexion with the mother country, we did not, as in- the present instance, indorse a proposition that Australian interests should be absolutely intrusted to the **British** Admiralty.

* In any **British** community the head of the Government and the members of the Government are looked to as the chief guides of public opinion.

* He indulged in a number of beautiful perorations, which represented the various parts of the **British** Empire as a vast problem, the only solution of which was to be found in drawing them together by closer ties, by the freest intercourse.

* I draw no geographical line between the members of the great Anglo-Saxon family of the **British** Empire.

* But if the question whether an officer is Australian or **British** is to enter into the determination of the matter- -if that is to be considered - the basest treason is perpetrated against our system of defence.

* I altogether despise this unpatriotic endeavour to create lines between the different branches of the **British** people Bythebye4 the Prime Minister, in that eloquent speech which he devoted to preferential trade, depicted the **British** Empire as one in "unity of action, in sympathy in aims."

* He said - 
I want to convey for New Zealand my concurrence in the expressions that Lord Tweedmouth has given utterance to, that we should have confidence in the Board of Admiralty and in the **British** Government in connexion with the Navy.

* world when her representatives went to England and asked the **British** Government to grant us a preference - to change what had been her national policy for nearly sixty years, and to impose heavy duties on foreign imports in order that we might reap the- benefit - was a somewhat sordid one.

* I should be -glad to see Australia grant a preference to **British** imports.

* Steps in that direction were, I think, taken by the then Postmaster-General' of New South "Wales on behalf of the other PostmastersGeneral to obtain from the **British** Government their concurrence - in view of the fact that they contributed towards the subsidy.

* Well, I am sorry to say that the Postmaster-  General of New South Wales was not on that occasion able to convince the Secretary of State for the Colonies or  the  **British** Postmaster-General of the necessity of taking steps in the direction desired ; and only very recently a development has occurred which seems to point to such serious consequences that tho whole ground may very well be covered again, and the question re-opened.

* It was stated that because the Admiralty regulation regarding vessels attached to the naval reserve, or classed as Admiralty cruisers, provided that a certain proportion of the crews of such vessels must be **British** subjects, that therefore the Orient Company were discarding their white crews with the view to the employment of **British** subjects only in the persons of lascars.

* myself and others who are interested in shipping matters, that the whole of the men who were employed on the Orient Company's boats, and who, I am glad to say, are still employed on the majority of them, are **British** subjects.

* The stokers and engineers, and the whole of the deck hands on these boats, with few exceptions, have been **British** subjects up to the present time, and therefore the argument that the Orient Company has been driven to' this course by the Admiralty regulations is altogether beside the question, in my view ; and the whole thing narrows itself down to the fact that the Orient Company after a struggle extending over many years, during which they have been anxious to properly preserve the **British** seamen as a class and keep them from absolute extinction - which seems to be the way they are going, under the present policy of the **British** people - are now driven by the fierce competition of many other lines, and especially of the P. and 0.

* I contend that, notwithstanding that these lascars are .**British** subjects, we have the right to object to any.thing that will have the effect of lowering the tone of the race generally or will have the effect of unfairly competing with our own citizens who are already employed on the coast.

* "We hear constant complaints in the magazines and other thoughtful journals about the disappearance of the purely **British** seaman, not only in the old land, but also on our own coast.

* The question of allowing assurances to be effected on the lives of children has been before the **British** public for a great many years.

* That Act was repealed in 1855, when the **British** Parliament allowed the assurance to be increased to 6 for children up to the age of five years, and to 10 for children up to the age of ten years.

* In Tasmania and Victoria, -money is permitted to be paid upon the death of children under ten years of age,' but the principle of paying the undertaker is adhered to.- The question- of - permitting assurance companies- tq undertake 'this business has from time to time been brought before Select Committees of the **British** Parliament, and has also been the subject of specific legislation.

* That is the general policy of the **British** law, and also of the laws of several other countries.

* The English Friendly Societies Act specially provides in section 67 - 
I may tell the honorable member that this particular provision has stood the test of **British** experience for some years.

* This clause is simply a reenactment of the provision in the **British** law.

* far as circumstances permit of the  forma-tion  of any definite opinion on the subject, it would seem to "be generally  unfavorable, '  the 5 per cent, preference on **British** goods being more than nullified by the increased duties.

* According to the newspaper from which I have quoted, the general opinion of manufacturers and merchants trading with the Australian colonies is that, while the preferential trade proposed will benefit **British** trade as against  the competition of rival countries, the advantage will be more than counterbal.anced by the general increase of duties in favour of the colonial producer.

* 5  per cent, preference is regarded as more than nullified by the raising of the duties all round, and the opinion is expressed that the only way in which **British** manufacturers could have benefited was by a preference of  10  to  15  per cent, which would have insured them the German trade.

* If, then, all the delegates say, " We are perfectly prepared to do what the Conference suggests, as we have come here with open minds, and have not been instructed to ask for anything in particular," it clearly follows that what the **British** Government suggests, and not what the Empire as a whole desires, will be adopted.

* That would be-about as unconstitutional an anomaly as could possibly be created - unconstitutional, not only in the sense that it is a breach of this written Constitution, but in the sense that it is opposed to every known principle of **British** constitutional law.

* When we, or our fathers, caine to Australia, we brought with us the rights of **British** subjects, as they have been made effective in the United Kingdom by the declarations of its Parliament and people.

* What we should say is, " We are men of **British** origin ; we know what we meant when we made this law.

* Imagine the case of a man whose son is leaving England to settle in one of the colonies where the **British** institutions, of which we are so proud, exist.

* Let us imagine him saying tohis son, " Youaregoing out to New South Wales, to a place where there are **British** institutions, a place where there is popular Government, and where the people have their own way.

* That is an arrangement which is spoken of as giving equality of **British** citizenship ; but there is no such equality under it.

* I say that while we remain a part of the **British** Empire, the prerogative of veto is an attribute of the Crown which we cannot deny.

* The imports of confectionery are nearly all comprised in three very large **British**, firms, all of whom treat their employes in a way that is.

* the Federal Houses of Commonwealth, is a man or woman who fulfils the bill as regards age, length of residence in Australia, **British** or Australian born,, having little or no property or other means, after a long life of toil, in applying for a pension to be classed as a pauper.

* build up a higher civilization, and to make Australia - which has gone farther than any other, part of the **British** Empire has gone in the extension of the franchise - renowned for its humanitarian treatment of aged citizens, who have grown grey in its service.

* Under the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain, the territorial limits are very clearly laid down for this and other purposes, principally to show the extent of the jurisdiction of **British** laws; and' I will ask the Prime Minister to cite any case in **British** law in which ah attempt has been made by a circuitous and indirect method to impose 
**British** law upon ships outside the threemiles limit.

* Was it not shown lately, in answer to  Mr. Chamberlain,  that the freights earned by **British** ships amounted to 80,000,000 per annum.

* I desire to show the comparative trade which the Commonwealth did with the United Kingdom, with **British** Possessions, and with foreign countries between 1901 and 1904.

* From the official statistics I find that in 1903 the proportion of the total trade which we did was with the United Kingdom 46`31, with **British** possessions 23`80, and with foreign countries 28`89.

* We seek to convince our **British** brothers across the seas, by arguments addressed to their consciences and to their hearts, that Chinese slavery in the **British** Empire cannot be for the well-being and progress of the Empire.

* We are not seeking to interfere with another part of the Empire, nor have we any idea of doing so, but we claim, by the blood shed on the veldts of South Africa, by the memory of our Australian brothers who are sleeping in the silent bivouacs of the dead, the right to say whether their blood was shed for the glorification of China or for the advancement of the **British** people.

* His  idea of a Chinaman is, perhaps, that he has a greater right in the **British** Empire than has the white man.

* If you were to take the sons of Lord Salisbury, or of  Mr. Gladstone,  or of the greatest men in the **British** Empire - even of the Prime Minister, who made such a brilliant speech this afternoon - and sent them to that country, in four generations from now their descendants would simply be men with hair sticking through their sombreros, and would be seen with a rooster under each arm going to a cock-fight on a Sabbath morning.

* Chinese to South Africa is the worst measure that was ever sanctioned by a **British** Administration.

* How can the **British** Government be so very short-sighted as not to see this?

* The **British** Empire is supposed to have a high standard of civilization.

* To the other crimes in **British** history a new one is about to be added, which in better days and more honorable times will be read of with universal shame.

* I firmly believe that out of the vastness of the abominable crime now being perpetrated against the **British** white race by a ring of South African boodle bloodsuckers, a commensurate vastness of effort will be raised against them by an aroused **British** democracy, determined not only to vindicate right against wrong, but to redeem the **British** Empire from the thraldom of predatory  boodle-bludgerdom  which prompts, directs, and concentrates the distant wrong.

* That being so, the Attorney-General, no doubt, felt that it would be futile for him to attempt to prove that this great principle which New Zealand has incorporated in her legislation - the principle of non-interference with **British** trade - should not be likewise incorporated in this measure, because the cases were not upon all-fours.

* The Bill, the honorable and learned gentleman said, is intended to deal with criminals, and he asked members of the Opposition - " Do you think that **British** traders are criminals, seeing that you wish to exclude them from its operation " ?

* He then proceeded to ask whether we imagined that **British** traders were so reprehensible that in their trade relations with Australia' they had that object in view.

* Great Britain's power and might, to which we owe so much, are based upon the commercial supremacy of the **British** people.

* It is to our own interests to see that **British** industry shall be - so far as we can make it - successful, and to insure that no successful **British** industry shall be penalized.

* In that  "ai  we should secure a navy large enough to protect all the interests of the **British** Empire - a  navy  which would possess advantages over and above those of a purely Australian Navy.

* but also the number of Australians who go into the **British** Navy, where they secure the best possible training.

* If, after a Minister has given an assurance that money put into a Trust Fund will not be touched until Parliament has decided how to spend it, his successor does not consider himself bound by that promise, all confidence in Ministerial utterances in this House will be destroyed, confusion will be created, and business will no longer be conducted according to the best methods of **British** parliamentary history.

* The best authorities place the beginning of the **British** Empire about 1606, when English "people founded the colony of Virginia.

* The **British** Empire will then be able to offer a united front to its enemies, and will continue from century to century maintaining and improving its position.

* to the **British** people.

* Not a manufacturer in Australia is prepared to remove one brick from the Tariff wall in order to grant a preference to **British** goods.

* Every Australian manufacturer would build up the Tariff wall until all **British** goods, in common with imports from foreign countries, were shut out.

* Why do not the Government plainly put the facts before the **British** people, saying, "We are not prepared to allow one ton of your goods to come in if they are likely to be a menace to our manufacturing industries " ?

* Is it not because the Government are not prepared to allow **British** imports to interfere in any way with our manufactures that they have offered a bogus preference?

* Otherwise we might very well be content to allow the **British** Government to maintain its present direct relationship to the island, and to continue to discharge its responsibilities for the preservation of its integrity as a part of the Empire.

* He went further, and said that he believed that every inch of the soil of New Guinea would be held- as sacred as the soil of the **British** Isles.

* Recent history shows that the Home Government do not regard the islands in the Pacific in the same way that they look upon the **British** Isles.

* .Does the Minister suggest that, in any conceivable circumstances, the **British** Government would cede any portion of the **British** Isles to a foreign power?

* Could we secure the immediate action of the fleet in the same way as the **British** Government could?

* Mr. Chamberlain  in his despatch makes it perfectly clear that at a future stage he will press upon this Commonwealth the obligation of looking after the **British** Solomon Islands as well as New Guinea.

* He makes it clear, too, that the **British** Government do not want to have anything more to do with the islands in the Pacific than they are compelled by Australia to have.

* What was the reason given at the time for this tardy proceeding on the part of the **British** Government - a proceeding, it seems to me, which did not reflect the highest credit upon our Colonial-office as we knew it in days gone by?

* I deny altogether the statement of the Prime Minister that we have only to do with **British** New Guinea.

* If we take over **British** New Guinea and assume all responsibility for its Government and for preserving it for all time as an integral portion of the **British** Empire, we should have some say in regard to Fiji, the Solomon Group, and other islands, all of which may be used as bases by enemies in future just as readily as New Guinea.

* All he says is that we ought to get control of **British** New Guinea, and then we shall see what we are going to do.

* It seems to me to be important to ascertain whether we could not manage our silver coinage in such a way that it might be current coin in England, and on board **British** ships, as well as in Australia.

* I asked the Treasurer to-day whether it is a fact, as stated in the press, that Australian silver coins would not be capable of being used in England, or on **British** vessels trading between Australia and England.

* If we can get rid of the differentiation in value between English and Australian coined silver, so as to enable our coins to pass current in England, and on **British** ships, we ought to do so.

* It has the support of quite half the members of the **British** Parliament ; it has been favorably referred to by one **British** Minister after another, and it is safe to affirm that the concensus of competent opinion throughout Great Britain is in favour of its adoption.

* Moreover, there is a common fear amongst the thoughtful people of that country that, if they do not adopt the metric  system  now, notwithstanding the f  friction  and the expense which its adoption will cause, the expense and trouble of the change will become greater as time goes on, and, in the meanwhile, the retention of the present system will so affect **British** manufacture and trade that her people will lose countless millions of money.

* The system based upon the French standard has been adopted, as I previously stated, by 480,000,000 of people, and therefore it would be very desirable for the **British** nation to fall in with it.

* Till public opinion has been formed and expressed in a way which cannot be mistaken, no change will be made by **British** Ministers.

* In such matters **British** Governments generally follow a very long way behind, as any one who ii acquainted with the technical and scientific equipment of continental countries is perfectly well aware.

* I need hardly say that it is used by chemists and physicists in all parts of the **British** Empire.

* The honorable member for Lang stated that the provision in the English1 Act, requiring that all goods shall bear a label showing their place of origin, was inserted because continental traders found it advantageous to .place on the **British** market goods bearing labels giving **British** towns as the place of origin.

* If the Government chooses under this Bill to say that there is danger of war, not in Australia but in any part of the **British** Empire, they will be- able to bring into play the extraordinary powers with which they are to be vested, to call out the inhabitants, and .to enforce what is called martial law.

* It is a responsibility which was taken by the **British** Government in the South African trouble.

* It is an old principle of **British** constitutional law that a standing army is a menace to the security of the State.

* Despite all the needs of an Imperial power, the English Army Act ceases to operate so far as England and the Channel Islands are concerned, on the 30th April ; so far as regards other parts of Europe, the West Indies, and 
-I have asked them many a time to do so, but there seems to be an understanding with the **British** Government that the steamer is to be kept running, although, unfortunately, they have ceased their contribution of 3,500 a year, which, if continued, would have made a great difference ' to the Possession.

* I find, for example, in the report by Captain Creswell, which was presented to this House on the 7th of February, 1902, two extracts, one from the  Monthly Review  of June, 1901, in which  Sir J.  C. R. Colomb makes some reference to **British** control in the Pacific, and the other from the  United  Service Gazette  of July, 1901. '

* The first passage reads as follows : - 
The hope of **British** survival in the Pacific is not in mounted infantry or bushmen scouts - those admirable troops of proved excellence in modern war by land - it lies in means of local production and maintenance of battle power in that ocean.

* The mere fact of having to drag across the globe almost every single thing necessary for the repair and equipment of **British** ships is a heavy handicap in war with a nation or nations having the necessary sustaining power,- so to speak, on the spot.

* Great and powerful as the **British** fleet is, it will be taxed to the uttermost to cover and protect a world-wide commerce, which is the life of the nation, and at the same time carry on the heavy work of the major operations of war in Europe.

* Absolute and complete dependence by Australia upon the **British** Navy, situated as we are at the extremity of the Empire, will add to that strain.

* From the figures given by the Prime Minister, which I have verified by reference to other, authorities, particularly  Coghlan,  I find that out of a total trade of 110,000,000 belonging to Australia and New Zealand, practically 90,000,000 goes to the Empire, 66,000,000 going direct to the United Kingdom, and the balance to **British** possessions.

* When this matter was under discussion in the House of Commons,  Sir Charles  Dilke - I quote from memory - said that the question of a naval contribution from the Australian colonies ought not to be taken into account, and added that the spontaneous offering of the people of Australia to the motherland, in connexion with the Boer war, was such as might be accepted with gratitude, because it inculcated the lesson, not only to the **British** people, but to the world at large, that the Empire is really one and indivisible.

* In brief, Australia, together with Canada and New Zealand, maintains and develops a large portion of the earth's surface for tlie **British** race, and in so doing, does more than merely provide depots where the surplus population of the mother country may settle in peace and tranquility  - on another occasion I pointed out that the chief export of the United Kingdom is human beings - and they also provide for the **British** race both breeding and feeding grounds, where the sons of -the mother country may increase and multiply ; where those who speak our mother tongue may strengthen and develop the power of the Empire, and build up an even greater system of trade and commerce than they now control.

* There can be no consolation to the struggling taxpayer in the fact that Australia does this kind of work ; but it ought to be some consolation to the **British** people to know that their fellow-countrymen are maintaining large parts of the earth's surface, wherein and whereon they may, if they choose, settle in peace and tranquility, and make honest livelihoods.

* The **British** people ought to know that because of this work a large amount of taxation, which would be otherwise thrown upon them, is avoided.

* Australians, Canadians, and New Zealanders, nowadays undertake a large amount of work which was previously carried out by the **British** people themselves.

* That is exactly, in 1113' view, the position in relation to the .great **British** possessions oversea, such as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

* On the other hand, if the **British** possessions were each to undertake the defence and control of its own particularpart of the Empire, while the mother country kept open the trading routes and highwaysthe work would be specialized, and weshould be much more successful in the conduct of our business.

* We ought not toact in opposition to all **British** ideals of loyalty in this regard - we ought not, as I have said, to hire patriots,  butto stimulate our  own citizens to carry on the.naval defences, of our own shores, cities, and people, as they have been stimulated in the case of the military defences.

* They are the words of an admiral in the **British** Navy, who declares that what Australia requires is something akin to the plan which I have been endeavouring to map out.

* The right honorable gentleman told us that five years ago the experts of the War Office in London advised him that the MartiniEnfield rifle was likely to be adopted as the standard rifle for the **British** Army.

* I am trying to show how absolutely necessary it was that we who are vitally interested in the retention of South Africa as part of the **British** Empire, should assist in defending it from attack.

* Surely if that be so, if it be admitted that there was justification for sending our troops to South Africa for the defence of **British** territory, there is justification for our arming ourselves with the power of doing the same on some future occasion.

* On this point the Navy League of England, which has done considerable work for the navy by keeping the Imperial authorities up to the mark in regard to that defence, writes as follows :  - 
This league asked of the people of all **British** possessions that they should aid them in seeing that our defence by sea is such as we desire.

* It is an undoubted fact that is within my own experience, as Premier of one of the States, that at times it is exceedingly difficult to get ammunition as it may be required supplied by the **British** authorities, or supplied by anybody else ; and it would be beyond anything that one can conceive in the way of a misfortune that we should find ourselves in a time of stress and trouble without sufficient armaments and sufficient ammunition - a difficulty that might very well be avoided by the establishment of such a factory as that suggested.

* But they will not cost us anything, seeing that we have largely increased the duties upon **British** -goods - in many cases having doubled them.

* If the preferences proposed had not been inserted in this schedule, probably the duties levied upon **British**- goods would have been those proposed upon goods from all parts, of the world.

* The general idea of the producers in Australia is that under preferential trade, they will secure a higher price for their products in the **British** market than is obtained by other people.

* If the fact is as I have stated - and if we are to reciprocate - the price of **British** goods in our markets ought 'also -to be higher than it is.

* they have inherited a great privilege in being **British** born, and that they enjoy great advantages from their **British** parentage, in return for which they should do all in their power to foster and encourage loyalty and devotion to the mother land.

* That, in the opinion of this House, the present administration of **British** New Guinea is unsatisfactory ; and, in the interests of good government and the effective development of the Territory, it is advisable that, on the issue of the Proclamation bringing the Papua Act into force, an Australian citizen, in close and recent touch with the aspirations of the Commonwealth and of the Territory, should be appointed LieutenantGovernor.

* Since his retirement, however, instead of progression, there has been retrogression, and it is with a feeling of humility, if not of shame, that one compares what has been accomplished in the Eastern Archipelago, in German and Dutch New Guinea, and1 in the Malay Federated States, with what has been achieved in **British** New Guinea.

* The New Hebrides is not a **British** Possession.

* Seeing that the Possession has now been under **British** rule for eighteen or twenty years - it is eighteen years since it was annexed to the **British** Crown - I do think that better results ought to have been realized.

* We hear to-day that it is suggested that Southern Europeans should be brought out to settle the Northern Territory, but I say that there is no spot on the face of the earth which the **British** people cannot settle as well as any people from Southern Europe.

* Men of the Teutonic stock from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and the **British** Islands, can stand any climate as well as can any white, black, brown, or yellow man, and can work where any of these men can work.

* The men of the **British** race blazed the track, and these other people followed after.

* I had hoped that our inscribed stock, consols, and various investments would be offered to the **British** public for sums as low as 5.

* The purchase money is 198,000, the rentals amount to 9,740, the estimated cost of repairs to the building is 46,000, and the estimated cost of a new building is 65,000 
There is no treaty between Great Britain and the United States on the subject of copyright, and until recently **British** authors could not prevent their works being pirated in America.

* Some measure of protection is, however, now accorded to **British** authors by virtue of the Act known as the Chace Act 1891.

* Copyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is a **British** subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in Australia, or plates made therefrom, or from plates or negatives made in Australia in cases where type is not necessarily used.

* Apparently the **British** Parliament has no time to devote to questions of this kind, and I think it is well that in passing a Copyright Bill we should take care to do all that we can to safeguard the rights of Australian and **British** authors generally.

* The American writer knows that he is able to draw his readers, not only from the  people  of his own country, but from those of every part of the **British** Dominions, with the exception, perhaps, of Canada, which has afforded its authors some protection in this regard.

* When in the year 1891, after the passing of the United States "Act, known as the  Chace  Act, **British** authors were enabled to obtain copyright in the United States, on condition that they printed and published there, the discontent of the Canadian publishers was greatly increased.

* By section i of this amending Act, it is provided that if a book " as to which there is subsisting copyright under the Copyright Act " has been  first  lawfully published in any part of the **British** dominions other than Canada, and if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Minister of Agriculture that the owner of the copyright so subsisting, ana!

* The Act does not touch Imperial copyright, and whether a **British** author takes advantage of the Act or not rests entirely with himself.

* If, on" the other hand, the author does not desire to take advantage of the Act of 1900, that Act has no effect upon his rights whatsoever .... Canada is not a party to the **British** Copyright Treaty with Austria.

* I  have no doubt that the Canadian Act of 1900 will go a long way towards inducing the Government of the United States to have more regard to the rights of **British** authors, and similar Australian action would greatly assist the English-speaking world.

* The mercantile marine is the greatest asset of the **British** Empire, and any attempt to  harrass  that asset must be dangerous, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the Empire.

* In the same way, the Government, doubtless, hope that the Navigation Bill .will be forgotten, together  with other legislation aimed at- the **British** workman.

* I take it that a party which advocates legislation aimed at **British** shipping and **British** workmen cannot claim from the mother country any great favours in the nature of preferential trade.

* The real friends of the **British** people are those who desire that the rates of duty imposed upon goods coming here from the mother country shall be as  low as possible, and who do not believe in harassing  and oppressing **British** seamen and workmen generally.

* We hear always this talk about the foreigner ; but it is merely so much bluff to carry through a scheme for robbing the **British** Empire by injuring its mercantile marine and for unfairly taxing our own producers.

* This scheme to prevent **British** and foreign vessels- from trading between the ports of the Commonwealth unless they comply with certain restrictions means, if it has any meaning at all, .

* The ocean is wide enough for all, and it is a doginthemanger policy to try to prevent coloured men who are subjects of the Empire from earning a living upon **British** steamers.

* The statements which had appeared, and the taunts at the honour and the valor and the loyalty of the **British** people and the **British** soldiers, including the Australians, were understated in that telegram, for in the message I received I found these words :  - 
Then follows a statement of the terms on which the Imperial Government would provide for that contingent.

* We had evidence of the sure and substantial progress of the **British** arms, offered by the speech of the Marquis of Salisbury, and also the fact that instead of its being thought a humiliation on the part of the **British** Government to ask for troops, there were at least these two specific occasions - in March and December, 1900 - on which they had asked that contingents might be sent out by us.

* As to our having waited for this official request, may I correct a statement which recently appeared in the press : It was reported in the  Argus  that I had stated at Maitland that it was a humiliation for the **British** Government to ask for troops.

* The newspaper in question has very properly corrected the misreport, as can be seen on reference to the  Argus  of Saturday last ; and I mention the matter now in order that it may be known from end to end of Australia that I did not make use of an expression so utterly unworthy of me as that it was a humiliation on the part of the **British** Government to ask for assistance from parts of the Empire whose duty it is to furnish that assistance.

* It will not do away with the need for **British** assistance.

* There will be the **British** navy plus what we provide.

* **British** communities have never repudiated liabilities of this kind.

* I  said years ago that I would resist the inception  of  a loan policy, and that the cost of defence should be levied by means of a Federal income tax, a copy of the **British** income tax, which is levied distinctly for war purposes.

* We were the youngest daughter of the **British** Empire, and glad to be associated with the Motherland, which looked after our protection ; but in a strong, and sometimes in a flaunting manner, we said that we intended to take the first step towards nationhood on our own account.

* I thought that it would be very awkward for one accustomed to the **British** system to become acquainted with the decimal and metric systems, but I found that it was possible within a week or two to understand them, and on my return to England I found it much more difficult to use again the **British** system.

* I am satisfied that if we adopted decimal coinage, and the metric system, we should save nearly half of the time at present devoted to teaching the **British** system of coinage and weights and measures in our schools.

* .That is so, but if one has a knowledge of the decimal system he can readily understand the metric system, and those who have been accustomed to the decimal and metric systems find it difficult to follow the **British** system.

* Australia is a **British** possession.

* I ask him not to forget that Australia is  ai  **British** possession.

* Surely the **British** Admiralty knows best what is most necessary for the defence of Australia !

* Without any loss of dignity we might consult the **British** Admiralty in respect of our naval defence, and be advised by them.

* The best men in the **British** Navy have gravitated from training ships, and in Australia there is certainly a class of boys running about our towns who would make better citizens if they were cleaned, disciplined, and taught something useful.

* Under this agreement, however, and this is one of the most favorable aspects of it, the **British** Admiralty would be required to keep us supplied with up-to-date ships during the continuance of the arrangement; 
I do not know that we should secure an equally good service.

* I am satisfied, however, that whatever arrangements were entered into, the **British** Admiralty would go rather beyond the letter of the agreement.

* He was able to do so, and one of the reasons that he subsequently gave for his belief that the Americans were superior in every way to the **British**, was that the latter had not yet come to realize the value of the "scrap heap."

* That scrap heap, the **British** Government undertake under this agreement to take ff our hands, and they can do so without any great loss, because throughout the wide area of Empire they have use for vessels which would be unsuitable for the one purpose for which they are required here.

* A matter which has been exercising my mind to some extent is the difficulty which I think will be caused by the different rates of pay which will prevail on the three drillships which will be manned by Australian and New Zealand seamen, and the- vessels which will be manned by **British** seamen.

* I have fixed that age because the **British** sailor is entitled to a pension after he has served 21 years.

* No one can tell when the **British** Empire may be involved in a great war.

* They were disappointed with the action of the **British** Government in connexion with the sugar duty, although it did not affect them very much, and afterwards they were disappointed at the removal of the corn duty.

* If we started with a navy of our own, the chances are that we should not be quite so closely in touch with' the mother country and its defensive organizations, as if our squadron were acting under the guidance of the **British** Admiralty.

* If we attempt to paddle our own canoe we shall not share in the glory of the **British** Empire, but we shall sink into a position of no importance among the nations of the world.

* **British** instincts have always revolted against.

* Professor Pearson says - 
When he (the black labourer) multiplies, the **British** race begins to consider labour of all but the highest kinds dishonorable, and from the moment that a white population will not work in the fields, on the roads, in the mines, or in factories its doom is practically sealed.

* The capital which sends Scotch manufactures to London, and brings back English manufactures and corn to Edinburgh, necessarily replaces, by every such operation, two **British** capitals, which have both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain.

* The capital which sends **British** goods to Portugal, and brings back PortuguesegoodstoGreat Britain, replaces by such operation only one **British** capital.

* The writer points out that the exports of **British** manufactured goods fell, between 18S4 and 1898, from 94,000,000 to 65,000,000.

* Yes, in special **British** lines, and imports of the same special lines into England have increased from 32,000,000 to 55,000,000.

* He is a Government official in the department of the foreign office, and in consequence of circulars sent out, he was required to make reports as to the position of **British** trade in various countries.

* These losses consisted of 19,081,000 with **British** possessions and the balance of 27,34.1,000 with the rest of the countries of the world.

* The f  falling-off  in exports to foreign nations was 24,214,000 and that to **British**, possessions of 18,543,000.

* He refused, however, to say how he viewed the action of the present Ministry in offering to present the **British** Government with a  Dreadnought  without consulting this Parliament.

* When the Fisher Government placed orders for the construction of certain vessels, the cost of which was to be defrayed out of the special defence vote, Parliament was in recess, and honorable members were scattered all over the Commonwealth; but when the present Ministry made the offer of a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Government, Parliament was in session, and, since it was not consulted, there was a distinct outrage of the Constitution.

* He should have said that the Government proposed to make an offer of a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Government, and have asked for our approval.

* To every **British** man or women who wants to emigrate, we say, " Come- to Australia, where every man who likes to work can have his own home on his own land."

* I read up the subject by circulars and handbooks supplied by the **British** Government's Information Office.

* Any man who has a family ought to be given all the privileges of a free-born **British** subject.

* The **British** flag protects and welcomes many races, giving them rights and exacting duties.

* That is how Queensland spoke in favour of labour, although that State has .the vilest franchise under the **British** flag.

* To-day we are sorry to state the Armenian is outstripped by the Melbourne **British** Customs thief.

* It is humiliating to think that Australia is peopled by the **British** race.

* As bearing upon the question of the collection of duty upon explosives, I should like to read the following statement contained in a letter addressed to the Prime Minister by the representatives of **British** Explosives manufacturers doing business in Australia - 
Under the heading " Arms and Ammunition " in the schedule there is a sub-heading "dynamite."

* When, therefore, those haring a knowledge of the trade read the proposal  re  dynamite they naturally concluded that it was intended to be operative in regard to gelatine dynamite, gelignite, and blasting gelatine, and that these nitro-glycerine compounds would be taxable if imported elsewhere than from the United Kingdom in **British** ships.

* -There are five distinct **British** firms which are importing explosives into Australia, namely, Messrs. Curtis and Harvey Limited, the **British** Explosive' Syndicate, the National Explosive Company Limited, London, Messrs.. Kynoch Limited, Birmingham, and Nobel's Explosives Company Limited, Glasgow.

* I very much doubt if there is a combine among the manufacturers of explosives, because I remember that at the time of the South African war there was a great fight for the contract to supply cordite to the **British** army after the failure nf the makers at Walbeck Abbey to meet the demands made upon them.

* I think that the importers of **British** gelignite, dynamite, and glycerine would be satisfied if the Minister were to make the item read, " Dynamite and other explosives containing nitroglycerine."

* hurled opprobrious epithets at the **British** people.

* He has never suggested that we should exclude **British** people from Australia.

* The charge levelled against the honorable and learned member by the  Argus  is that he has hurled opprobrious epithets at the people of Great Britain, and that practically he has sought to exclude **British** subjects as such from the Commonwealth.

* For the past fifteen years power has existed to alienate the lands of **British** New Guinea at a very low price.

* With reference to  Mr. Craig,  and the charges he has made against certain officials in **British** New Guinea, I should like to say that the matter has been before the Department for a long time.

* The visit of the Secretary of the Department to **British** New Guinea will afford an opportunity for an inquiry, without the necessity of appointing a Royal Commission.

* In  every 100  worth of goods produced in 'Australia the value of the labour is 30 as against ^20 paid by the **British** manufacturer.

* **British** competitor ought to be sufficient for any manufacturer in Australia.

* Recognising what Great Britain has done for us in the past, and is doing for us at the' present time, I hope that no young Australian, not even the honorable member, wishes by a high protective Tariff to shut out the products of English manufacturers and the results of the labour of **British** workmen.

* The agreement gives us not only the protection of "a local squadron, but, in addition, that which will be ours, and as a matter of fact has always been ours, the protection of the fleet of the whole **British** Empire..

* By this agreement we shall, by a form of partnership, secure the services of the whole of the **British** Navy, and feel secure both as to our local defence by sea and as to the protection of our commerce -afloat.

* We are more closely bringing together our ties of common interest, and we are purchasing at this exceedingly low price the proud privilege of -being co-sharers with the mother country in that splendid navy which has built up our Empire, which has carried the **British** flag throughout an Empire wider than that of Akbar or Alexander, and carried with it everywhere the highest enlightenment and perfect freedom.

* But I think the Attorney-General regrets those remarks, and he must admit that the position he takes up is the position of the honorable member for Wentworth, when that honorable member said that, assuming the **British** Government refused to give full power of autonomous government, he would be compelled to make his decision.

* This Constitution was given to us by the **British** Parliament.

* The **British** Parliament indorsed the powers contained in it, and the Attorney-General is as well aware as any other honorable member, that the **British** Parliament knew at the time the effect of the section he quoted.

* Surely if in those days the people here could resist the landing of **British** subjects of **British** birth, federated Australia is in a position to ask the Imperial authorities to allow her to carry into effect the desires and aspirations of her people  1  In answer to the objection that the people have not fully considered this matter, I would say that the States ha.ve considered it, and that prior to the union some of them passed Statutes restricting the immigration of undesirable and servile races.

* With regard to the educational test I think it is absurd, and I trust that we shall not be weak enough to approach the **British** Government with any such subterfuge, but that our attitude will be characterized by robustness and honesty, instead of our taking a roundabout course.

* Whilst we may entertain racial prejudices, we do not extend them so far as to say that we will not do business with any man because he is not of **British** origin.

* But we have been discussing whether the adoption of the amendment would render inoperative the preference to **British** goods which is supposed to be conferred by this Bill.

* **British** born are employed on **British** vessels - knowing that for the time being it is almost impossible to secure **British** ships having no foreigners in their crews - I think that the honorable member would have regard to the interests which he seeks to uphold if he accepted an amendment of the amendment striking out the word "**British**."

* 203,000 worth were of **British** origin.

* The total imports of carpets and carpetings last year were valued at 124,000, of which 115,000 worth were of **British** manufacture.

* Upon these articles the duty has been increased from 20 to 30 per cent, in the case of **British** manufactures, and to 35 per cent, in the case of goods of foreign origin.

* per ton to 20 and 25 per cent, in the case of **British**!

* Upon this line, which was formerly free, -duties' of 15 and 20 per cent, respectively have been imposed in respect of **British** and foreign goods.

* In the case of blankets and blanketing, the old rate of duty has been advanced from 15 to 30 per cent, notwithstanding that of the 53,000 worth imported -last year 49,000 worth were of **British** origin.

* the case of **British** goods, and 30 per cent, in the case of the foreigner.

* Under the old Tariff, this commodity was free, but under the present Tariff, it is dutiable at 25 per cent, in the case of **British** goods, and 30 per cent, in the case of goods of foreign origin.

* They desired to get away from' **British** rule ; but we do not wish to get away from civilization.

* The question has been discussed from three standpoints, namely, whether there shall be Government control of the liquor traffic; whether the white people of **British** New Guinea shall control it; or whether there shall be total prohibition.

* As reported in  Hansard,  page 7353, he said, with regard to his prohibition amendment - 
We intend that the question of the liquor traffic in **British** New Guinea shall be a live one, as far as the temperance party are concerned.

* The object of the proposal before the Committee is to force these persons to buy a dearer though less serviceable oil, to the advantage of the **British** Imperial or Commonwealth- Oil Company.

* **British** jurisprudence, by throwing the onus  of proof of innocence upon the person accused.

* Hitherto, under all accepted notions of **British** justice, even the greatest criminal has always been assumed to be innocent until his accusers have proved him to be guilty.

* In all the legislation with which the members of the present Government have had anything to do in this Parliament this fundamental principle of **British** justice has not only been ignored, but has absolutely been reversed.

* There is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth from transferring the whole of its silver coinage to some other part of the **British** Empire.

* coinage we now have here to other parts of the **British** Empire, and replacing it with our own.

* They did not understand the question, and they thought that they would be doing a good stroke of business if they could secure a douceur of 10,000 per annum from the **British** Government in respect to the silver coinage in circulation in the Commonwealth.

* The correspondence that has since taken place reveals the fact that, in the first Instance, the late Ministry misinformed the **British** Government as to the intentions of the Commonwealth in this matter.

* Finally, the **British** Government were informed that we desired their assistance in getting rid of the present silver coinage to the extent of 200,000 per annum.

* There is no doubt in my mind that the order of things which prevailed in the **British** Isles in the fourteenth century was based upon equity to some extent.

* The Government practically opposed an amendment which would have placed the Bill on a similar basis to that which has governed the conditions which have pertained in military matters in the **British** Isles.

* If, however, the electors at the next contest indicate by their votes that they are notin favour of these measures of a class character introduced by this Government 
I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether, in view of the misrepresentation and ignorance displayed by Australian detractors and others, the Government will take special steps to make the nature and objects of the Immigration Restriction Act known to the **British** Government and  its  people'?

* Why should we decline to give a preference to our own steamers, and to the **British** capital invested in those lines of steam-ships ?

* The Government proposal is not to give them a preference, but to place **British** steam-ships, which come here, on a par with those of foreign countries.

* A point that has been overlooked is that a considerable portion of **British** capital is invested in Australian steam-ship companies.

* Our aim and object should be to make the Royal Navy the Empire's navy, supported by the whole of the self-governing portions of the Empire, and not solely supported by the people of the **British** Isles, as is practically the case at the present time.

* He went on then to suggest that a conference of the leading men in the **British** dependencies should take place, and we have every reason to believe that it is intended that such an arrangement shall be made.

* The Minister went on to say that - 
If such a plan can be brought about, it would be necessary for the "**British** Dominions beyond the Seas" to be adequately represented at the Admiralty, and I feel sure this could be arranged on a mutually satisfactory basis.

* We have it in evidence that, if the Minister for Defence has his way, there will be no such thing as an Australian Navy, but there will be an Imperial Navy, to which we shall contribute, and to which we shall contribute our quota in the same proportion as do the **British** people.

* Where there is a fair field open to him, the German who cannot succeed under German rule will succeed under **British** rule.

* One very serious cause of friction is the Australian mail subsidy at present paid to Messrs. Burns,Philp, and Co. As you know Burns, Philp, and Co. are essentially traders, and it is considered decidedly unfair by other **British** trading firms that Burns-Philp's vessels should be given that advantage, particularly as there are so few obligations imposed under the contract with the Federal Government for the delivery of mails or the carriage of cargo.

* Another point which would proBably appeal to Australian sentiment is the fact that whilst Burns, Philp receive this subsidy, presumably for helping on **British** development of the group, they are in no way bound to give any preference to Britishers. "

* Of course, being essentially a trading firm, they  will  go where it pays them best, but  it  is rather a short-sighted policy for the Commonwealth, whose interests are in making the New Hebrides **British**, to pay thousands away for a service which in some instances gives the preference to French trade, and carries **British** and French cargo at equal rates, while, at the same time, collecting in Customs duties a  considerable  amount from the **British**.

* I believe he is connected with the New Hebrides **British** Association, and he has sought this opportunity to appeal to the fountain of justice, and to endeavour to get this Parliament and "this Government to right the wrongs that exist.

* I ask the Minister to cause an inquiry to be made into the matter, so that if any wrong is being done to the **British** traders, 'it may be put right.

* I have hoped for many years past that some day we should be able to bring about something approaching an Imperial Zollverein, bv which the different sections of the people belonging to the **British** Empire, as a whole, could encourage trade one with the other, to their mutual advantage and profit.

* When the proposal for preferential trade began to assume something like concrete form in the mother country, I expressed from the plat form my full belief in the wisdom, from the stand-point of every section of the **British** family, of establishing preferential trade relations.

* Then a reference was made by him to the appeal sent to me by the representatives of the **British** trade unions, which he said demonstrated the horror felt in England of any food taxation.

* I believe that the cheapening of produce throughout the world has brought within the reach of the **British** working man commodities which he had no opportunity of obtaining with the limited purchasing power which he possessed a few years ago.

* These facts show that the improvement of the **British** people has not necessarily been due to the adoption of a free-trade policy.

* Then we have to consider what is the position of **British** trade to-day.

* My contention, however, is that, while until recently compensation was offered to **British** manufacturers, in that they were sending an enormous quantity of goods to the colonies, we find that of late years the foreigner has entered the colonial markets, and that the old saying that "trade follows the flag" is being falsified more and more every year.

* He drew attention to the enormous preponderance of **British** imports into that country.

* He stated that an enormous proportion of the goods sent to India last year were of **British** origin, and consequently he claimed that there was no need, so far as that country was concerned, to .fear the competition of the foreigner.

* But I would direct his attention to the fact that whilst he gave the total quantity of **British** goods exported to India, he did not give the comparative figures in regard to any recent period.

* From the latest information to be derived from  Mulhall,  I find that in India **British** imports have declined from 58.2 to 45.2 - a decrease of 13 per cent.

* But the prime Minister did not institute any comparison between **British** and foreign imports into India.

* But so far as tea is concerned, the value of my figures is not destroyed, because the source 'of importation of that article between the years I have mentioned has changed almost entirely from China to India and Ceylon, which are within the **British** Empire.

* The honorable member must know that a large portion of the sugar which we import is obtained from the Mauritius, which is a **British** Possession.

* It is a significant fact that alongside a decline of  7,000,000  in **British** imports, there has been an increase of 6,000,000 in our imports from foreign countries.

* I do not see that that fact affects my argument as to whether **British** manufacturers are holding their own or being defeated by foreign competitors.

* The real question is whether we have in Australia a permanent market for **British** products, if we grant them a preference over the products of the foreigner.

* Something has been said during the debate with regard to the position of Canada, and attempts have been made to underrate the effect of the preference extended by Canada to **British** goods.

* They had dropped to less than $29,401,188, but immediately the preference was granted an expansion took place, until last year the value of **British** : imports into Canada had increased to $58,793,038.

* Great Britain had a preference of one-third of the total Tariff, and in the case of china and glass, for example, that preference was increased to one-half, so that where the foreigner paid 30 per cent, on goods of this class which he exported to Canada, the duty paid on **British** imports would be only 15 per cent.

* The Prime Minister last evening made some remarks with reference to the position of the **British** farmer under a preferential scheme.

* He asked why, in the interests of the farmers of Australia, the **British** farmer should be called upon to suffer under a system of preferential trade.

* He seems to imagine that under such a policy the **British** farmer would be in a worse position than he is in at present.

* I thought thathe was speaking, seriously, and was going to say that the **British** farmer has to-day to face the competition of the whole world.

* He certainly will not be placed in a worse position if the area of competition be limited to the **British** Empire.

* I shall not say more on that point, except that it seems absurd to suggest that the adoption of this proposal would place the **British** farmer in a worse position.

* It seems to me that it is idle for us now to put forward our ideas as to the exact shape that preference should take, when there must be consultation and conference on the subject generally between the representatives of the dependent self-governing portions of the Empire and the **British** Government.

* But as a mutual advantage accrues from improved trade relations between the various sections of the **British** people, the feeling will growup that it is necessary for them to stand together, that their interests are one, and that they can afford to disregard action taken by foreign countries to injure their trade and commerce.

* Can he inform the House -as to what steps are being taken by the **British** Government to carry into effect the Joint Convention regarding the New Hebrides, and when the Joint Court is to be established?

* Is he aware that it is reported that while the **British** Judge is not even appointed yet, the French Judge is already in the Group familiarizing himself with the matters to be brought before the Joint Court; and, further, that it is reported in accordance with the foregoing, that the French Judge is to act on the Bench as an advocate of French interests, whereas the **British** Judge is to act as a Judge in the ordinary sense of the term ?

* Is he aware that the **British** settlers allege that French citizens are being appointed to all the local offices under the control of the Joint Convention, and that in consequence they are to hold an indignation meeting in the Group in the early part of this' month?

* There are also the National Explosives Company, of Cornwall: Kynochs, Essex ; **British** Explosives Company, Glasgow ; Curtiss and Harvey and Chilworth, England.

* Fuse known as safety fuse, is all of **British** manufacture, and is made bythe following firms :  - Messrs. Bickf ord, Smith and Company, Cornwall ; Nobels, 
Glasgow ; Bennett, Cornwall ; and Brunton, Wrexham.

* are of **British** manufacture; 75 per cent.

* of the detonators are of **British** manufacture; and all the fuse is of **British** manufacture.

* Re  complaint of Perry Company, as to non-supply of fuse powder, I am assured that **British** manufacturers can and will supply such powder.

* All safety fuse for blasting imported into Victoria is of **British** manufacture.

* I trust that when the Government initiate their immigration policy, at an expenditure of  ,200,000  or more, the main proportion of the immigrants will be drawn from the United Kingdom, and that the greater number of the **British** immigrants will be men engaged- in the engineering and kindred trades.

* Our safety, I contend, lies in the fact that Australia is a **British** Possession.

* Surely the **British** Admiralty knows best what is most necessary for the defence of Australia !

* Without any loss of dignity we might consult the **British** Admiralty in respect of our naval defence, and be advised by them.

* The best men in the **British** Navy have gravitated from 'training ships, and in Australia there is certainly a class of boys running about our towns who would make better citizens if they were cleaned, disciplined, and taught something useful.

* In the matter of defence, we stand in much the same relation to the **British** Empire as does the citizen to the State in regard to the protection of property.

* In the same way, if we attend to the defence of our parts - if we see to our coastal defences - and make a reasonable contribution to the cost of the **British** Navy, we shall have nothing to fear.

* Before Australia could be taken by an enemy, it would be necessary, first of all, for the **British** Empire as a whole to be vanquished.

* A great deal has been said as to the offer of a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Government, but I am inclined to think that the gift the Government intend to make will not take that form.

* Our contribution  -per capita  to the cost of the **British** Navy is so small as compared with that made by the people of Great Britain that we ought not to hesitate to be more liberal in the matter of our subsidy, and I am satisfied that that will be the direction which the offer of the Government will ultimately take.

* We should have known that, because when the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was being discussed, the question of our power to prescribe different rules for foreign and **British** vessels in the Australian coastal trade was discussed in this Chamber.

* In my opinion, the Bill amounts to nothing more than an affirmation by both Houses of the principle of preference, and surely this expression of opinion should be sufficient to let the **British** people know the views of the majority here on the subject.

* Whv should we go further, when the moral effect of our attempt to legislate is sufficient, and the Imperial Government has not the mandate of the **British** Parliament to reciprocate ?

* **British** ships carry 55 per cent, of the trade of the United States of America, and about 26 per cent, of that of Germany, and it has been pointed out that legislation of this sort may lead to reprisals by foreign countries in the way of tonnage dues on **British** shipping.

* I do not believe that **British** shipping can be successfully attacked for many years to come, because, owing to the free ports of Great Britain, it is too strong.

* Other nations could not do their foreign trade without using **British** ships, and, if by their reprisals they prevented **British** ships from entering into it, it would be a long time before they could substitute a sufficient tonnage of their own.

* I do not think that the **British** people require this gift.

* Mr. H.  W. Macrosty,  in his book,  The Trust Movement in **British** Industry,  page 344, says- 
I am in favour of the Bill and of the provision we are discussing, and would not have risen had it not been for the remarks of the honorable member for Maranoa regarding the volunteers.

* I know of one or two corps in Tasmania which have been in existence for fifty years or more, and some of their members are now qualified to take a place alongside the trained men of the **British** Army.

* It is true that some of them may be under engagement to serve in the **British** Navy, but they will undertake to serve only upon the seas which are within the sphere of operations ; and if, believing that we can do better for our protection with an Australian Navy, we dispense with the assistance of the Imperial Navy, their experience and training will be useful to us.

* As part of the great **British** Navy, our men, as things are now, will get better training than they could hope to get in a local squadron manned entirely by our own men.

* The leading, guidance, and experience we can obtain for their training under such an agreement would, on the sudden creation of .a purely Australian Navy, not be obtainable, unless we bought that guidance and experience by paying salaries to **British** officers.

* The **British** Empire is not like Empires of old, which were constituted for the purpose of enabling some central authority to dominate and enslave the rest.

* As the component parts- of the **British** Empire have acquired self government, in that very degree have they themselves become stronger, and, contrary to the principle acted on of old, so much stronger has the old country herself become.

* I am not an elector of the **British** Empire ; I have nothing to say in its control, and shall have nothing to say in the control of the naval subsidy if this Parliament votes it.

* After commenting on the fact that, while the statements made by the **British** Ministers at the Conference had been published, the replies of the Colonial Premiers had not been disclosed, he asked for the views of the Government upon the chief questions dealt with by theConference, namely, the naval and military defence of the Empire, and the commercial relations between the mother country and the selfgoverning colonies.

* So I leave that matter of the naval defence with the fullest confidence in the result, with the fullest confidence that when the Australian, or the New Zealander, or the **British** ' South African gives his consent to doing- this, the Canadian will,- in generous rivalry, say - "Well, I do'nt mean to be behind that."

* We do not care to see colonists, as it were, hiring **British** ships at so rauch per ton per annum, to guard their shores.

* It is because we are so intensely convinced of the importance of sea-power to the Empire, and of the sea-spirit, that we want to see Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and South African squadrons, for which the four free nations of the Empire are responsible, even though they place them in far-distant waters to learn their business, and to take their share of creating- and maintaining the command of the sea for the **British** Empire.

* History shows that in the war of 1 779-1 782, the West Indian Islands - then the most valuable of the **British** colonies - were virtually abandoned till the Channel was made safe.

* I am not, of course, speaking of action on the continent of Europe, but it will not be necessary for any of us to go far to conceive cases in which in support of our colonies it might be necessary to send a large **British** force, and in some cases in quarrels in which Great Britain's interest would- be considerably less than that of the colony affected.

* The colonies rest their arguments on the fundamental principles of the **British** Constitution, and their own Imperial growth.

* It has been stated that we are endeavouring to satisfy  Mr. Chamberlain  by making some offer of a preference to **British** goods.

* If the gentlemen to whom I refer would promise that we shall not interfere with **British** politics, we might discuss the matter from an Australian standpoint.

* Honorable members who entertain the same view as he does, do not suggest anything like the free admission of **British** goods to our ports.

* Further, they wish to obtain some corresponding advantage in the **British** market.

* We have been repeatedly assured that **British** trade is declining.

* For some reason or other, however, upon his return to England, , he changed his tune, and arrived at the conclusion that **British** trade was declining, To suit hi 3 purpose, he selected the years which would best fit his arguments.

* He pointed out that after a lapse of thirty years, **British** exports had increased by only 20,000,000.

* As a matter of fact, he made a mistake of 10,000,000.1 He argued that because the exports pf the mother country had only increased by that amount, **British** trade was declining.

* The explanation of that is to be found in the fact that 1872 was a boom year in **British** trade, because of the War between France and Germany, and because of the borrowing policy adopted by the nations of the world.

* The fact is that  Mr. Chamberlain  compared the boom year of **British** trade with the year 1902, when England was just emerging from one of the greatest wars in which she has been engaged.

* **British** trade has increased correspondingly with that of the other nations of the world.

* The export of **British** and Irish produce in 1902 amounted to 283,000,000.

* It is absolutely 'clear that, instead of there being cause to lament the decline of **British** trade, the mother  country  occupies a position of undoubted prosperity.

* We are told that we should grant a preference in respect of **British** goods.

* We have the land, and everything is ready for the use of our farmers if the **British** market can be captured.

* The balance came in about equal proportions from **British** possessions and other foreign countries.

* I cordially support the motion for incorporating **British** New Guinea.

* evening on the question of the incorporation of **British** New Guinea.

* The importations from' other **British** Possessions were small, being in 1905 nearly 20,000 lbs., and in 1906 a little over 13,000 lbs.

* He declared his willingness to increase the Tariff against both **British** and foreign manufactures.

* But, as a matter of fact, it is of **British** manufacture.

* She already enjoys a natural preference - probably because the **British** article is superior to the German.

* I do not know that we can give a preference of 5 or 10 per cent, to all classes of **British** goods.

* I do not think that we should give any general preference to **British** goods, because a difficulty will always arise as to their origin.

* We know perfectly well that quite a number of articles which are imported as **British** goods are not made in Britain at all.

* It is worthy of notice, however, that, though we are told by the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth has not been committed to anything until Parliament ratifies the agreement arrived at, the additional sum which Australia is asked for has been placed upon the **British** estimates.

* It is also worthy of remark that men like  Sir Charles  Dilke and others affirm that this additional sum of money is of no value whatever to the **British** people.

* It stands for the United Kingdom and the **British** Empire.

* stopped under the **British** flag.

* I went from Gibraltar, through the Suez Canal, touching in Egypt - there was the **British** flag.

* T went on to Ceylon - there was the **British** flag; and then I ended my long journey at the westernmost part of Australia, and there was a **British** flag."

* Is it not a fact that both in Canada and Natal the local flag is always flown together with the Union Jack, the former as the colonial national symbol and the latter as the symbol of the **British** Empire?

* Seeing that the inclusion of a miniature Union Jack in the Australian flag does not and cannot make it the flag of the **British** Empire, will he confer with the Minister for Defence so that directions may issue in order that wherever Empire Day (24th Mav) is officially celebrated in the Commonwealth the Union Jack may be given the place of honour as the emblem of **British** unity.

* The Bill is founded on the report of the Conference, and that again is largely founded upon **British** legislation.

* The term fixed is fourteen years, as in England and all the **British** dominions, except Canada, where the term is eighteen years.

* The duties originally proposed by the Government in respect of wire-netting were 25 per cent, upon imports of **British** manufacture, and 30 per cent, upon those of foreign manufacture.

* Now as soon as the Government altered those proposals by substituting a duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of **British** manufacture, and of 15 per cent, upon netting of foreign origin, the preference to the mother country became increased to 33 per cent.

* If we impose a duty of 5 per cent, upon wire-netting of **British** manufacture, and of 10 per cent, upon netting of foreign origin, we shall be granting to the mother country a preference of 50 per cent.

* The honorable member, at any rate, is not satisfied with him, and would rather have an imported officer belonging to the **British** Army.

* But those who have studied the history of **British** wars know that mistake after mistake has been made, and that it has only been by blundering through, that victory has been gained.

* When the **British** Army was before Sebastopol, and the question was whether to make an attack or wait for developments, we know how greatly the troops suffered for want of proper provision for their health and comfort.

* I have no desire to labour this question, but, as one whose ancestors for six generations were rankers in the **British** .Army - my grandfather was with Wellington, from the lines of Torres  Vedras  to the Loire, and my father enlisted for the Crimean war - I feel strongly upon it.

* Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the **British** Army, on the Field, in South Africa, 5/6/01.

* I believe that the Government ought tohave sufficient courage to declare their policy, and to allow the onus of preventingthat policy from being carried into effect toremain with  Mr. Chamberlain  or with the **British** Government.

* But at the "Jubilee conference of the various Premiers in London,  Mr. Chamberlain  delivered a sort of lecture, and told his hearers that because a large number of coloured people formed a part of the .**British** Empire, no Bill would be accepted by the **British** Government unless based on the Natal Act.

* Looking at this matter from another point of view, my opinion is that a policy is being initiated by  Mr. Chamberlain  to make us recognise Indian coolies as **British** subjects and brothers.

* So far as the law goes they are **British** subjects, but I doubt whether many of us recognise them in the true spirit of brotherhood.

* I am very sorry to say that at that time the War Office was so busily engaged in re-arming the **British** Artillery that they did not hold out any immediate hope of our getting guns of the latest pattern.

* As most honorable members are aware, I opposed the ratification of the Naval Agreement with Great Britain, not that I did not appreciate the value of having the **British** squadron in these waters- 
I tell the honorable member what I should do as a protectionist, but I throw the onus of proof in regard to free-trade on his shoulders, and those of his colleagues.

* If we do not make Australia self-supporting, what is the use of worrying about closer settlement, or about putting people on the land, when it is possible that the country may soon pass out of the hands of the **British** race into the hands of some invading force of, say, Chinese or Japanese?

* Certain communications from the **British** Government in regard to the Commission which it is proposed to appoint have been received, and are now under the considera- t ion of this Government.

* I have no reason to anticipate that the **British** Government will arrange any matters affecting Australian interests in Australian waters, without first consulting the Government of the Commonwealth.

* Nor do I think any Englishman warmly approves of the action of the **British** Government in forcing opium on China at the point of **British** bayonets.

* **British** manufacturers desire to send their goods here.

* It is not sufficient for them to be told that we have imposed lower duties on **British** goods than we have imposed on foreign goods, if the duties on English goods are sufficiently high to prevent such goods from being sent here.

* If we provided adequately for the naval and military defence of Australia, so that we could say, "We do not need the support of the **British** Navy," that would.be doing a great deal for the Empire, and would reduce the expenditure of Great Britain.

* I am as strong an advocate for the reduction of freights in order to assist our primary producers as any one could be, but we cannot expect to get freights as low as the freights which are paid by some of our strongest competitors in the **British** markets, because they are so much nearer than we are.

* If he will limit his proposal by striking out the word " **British**," I shall vote for his amendment.

* Our desire is to give a preference, not to the ship-owners of the old country, but to its manufacturers, who exercise no control over **British** ships.

* If the ship-owners of England refuse to employ exclusively white **British** seamen - as they will do until the Imperial Parliament enacts new legislation 
We know that there are vessels coming to Australia which are manned exclusively by white seamen, and that there are others which are manned by coloured seamen.

* If the **British** manufacturer could say, " I know that I can send my goods to Australia by a vessel which is manned exclusively by **British** sailors," there might be something in the proposal of the honorable member.

* That is an unfair insinuation to make, inasmuch as I have already said that, if the honorable member for Kalgoorlie will agree to strike out the word " **British** " from his amendment, I shall support it.

* Does he think for one moment that, in connexion with a scheme which will affect only a few hundred thousand pounds' worth of trade- 
When the idea of nationalizing the **British** railways was under discussion at the annual congress of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants,  Mr. R.  Bell, M.P., told the men not to forget that if the Government acquired control of the lines " many thousands " of the employes would have to be dismissed.

* sure that there were no Labour members appointed, seeing that there were very few, if any, Labour members in the **British** Parliament at that time.

* The investigations all went to prove up to the hilt that the English people were charged exorbitant rates as compared with those charged on the Continent; and the outcome was that  Mr. Gladstone  moved in the **British** Parliament that the telegraph service should be made a national institution.

* I find that the **British** Government own 177,000 shares in the Suez Canal, and that 400,000 other shares are in other hands.

* The **British** Government receive 28 per cent, on their investment, and that is not a bad thing for England; but, although such a large shareholder, England is not in a position to lower the Canal dues, because of the fact that 400,000 shares are in other hands.

* I undertake to say that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, of which the honorable member for Kooyong is a director, has, since its inception, wasted an amount of money which would have driven any other company into hopeless bankruptcy, tens of thousands of pounds having been thrown away at Block  14,  the **British** and other Barrier mines.

* The Government should bear in mind the fact that the **British** Government is reducing the subsidies of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company by  30,000  a year, while we are proposing to increase our subsidy to the Orient Steam Navigation Company by  40,000  or  50,000.

* Sir Thomas  Sutherland, when giving evidence before a Royal Commission in Great Britain, said that whenever the German Government wishes to send troops or cargo to the East or elsewhere, it gives the work to German boats, whereas the **British** Government invariably calls for tenders.

* The **British** Government, rightly or wrongly, believes in free-trade, and is .therefore consistent in calling for tenders for shipping services.

* Capitalists are prepared, if the subsidy be large enough, to fly the **British** flag,' the Australian flag, or that of any other nation.

* This he has never attempted, as he should have done, having regard to the promise made by the late Prime Minister to  Mr. "Chamberlain,  to assist in bringing about preferential trade ; and to-day, if one asks him what is the policy of the Government in that respect, he receives the reply, " It will depend upon the **British** Government."

* The Prime Minister declared further that it was recognised in **British** political circles, and indeed throughout the world, that the old position of fifty years ago should be re-considered -that the protection proposed to-day is not the protection of halfacentury ago.

* That is a strange statement to make, because the very arguments which are being used to-day in the great campaign now proceeding in England - the arguments as to benefits to the people to be derived from protection, the increased wages, the exclusion of the foreigner, the injury done to **British** manufactures by free importations, and the decay which will surely follow the freedom of our ports - were used fifty years ago.

* The Prime Minister further stated that the competition which the **British** workman had to suffer, and his consequent degradation, required a remodelling of the fiscal faith.

* Has not the movement of the **British** workman been upward ever since that time?

* We shall receive a communication from the **British** Government, intimating that they cannot allow us to carry out the intended policy, or that if we do, they will have to deprive us of certain advantages which they are then giving to us.

* Have his diatribes against the **British** Crown passed from the memory of honorable members?

* Is it not a fact that the present loyalty of Australia, which our past has never equalled, is due to the noble recognition of the **British** Government of the wisdom of leaving the sons of Great Britain in this land to work out their destiny without interference.

* We must also remember that if we adopt it the anticipated results to **British** trade are not at all certain.

* The percentage of the **British** trade to the whole import trade of Canada fell in the period of preference from 27.58 to 24.25 per cent., while that of the United States, the very, country aimed at, increased from 53.48 to 58.40, and the exports from the United States to Canada were of much the same character six or seven years ago as they are now.

* According to the figures quoted by the Prime Minister in recent speeches, and by the mover of the Address in Reply, our duties are not high enough to enable us to give any concessions to the **British** people.

* upon **British** exports.

* If we look at the enormous proportion of **British** shipping, we- shall see that it amounts practically to half the tonnage of the world.

* With the exception of the American service, the **British** mercantile marine is the highest paid marine in .the world.

* If for any good reason we cannot at present man our enormous shipping tonnage, by absolutely refusing employment upon, our mail steamers to Indian black subjects we are really providing men for foreign navies, because Germans and others are being employed, and in many cases trained, in the **British** mercantile marine.

* A great many of the men who- are being employed and trained in the **British** mercantile marine would, in case of war, be called upon to man their own country's navy.

* At the **British** shipping offices the same wages are paid to **British** and foreign seamen.

* Personally, I should be glad to see such an increase in wages, if it did not enable foreign nations to wipe the **British** mercantile marine off the ocean.

* If, at present, we cannot man more than half of our present shipping tonnage, I hold that by prohibiting the employment of these **British** dark subjects upon our mail steamers, we must make room, not for **British** sailors, but for foreign sailors.

* We must remember that these black **British** subjects, whose courage we doubted, and whose reliability we questioned, have fought for the Empire- 
When I object to proposals of a certain kind, as I have to do sometimes, I am actuated by the belief that they are not really designed to benefit the classes whose welfare they aremeant to secure.

* Whilst the Prime Minister desires to secure a flow of immigration, such as is taking place in Canada, he objects to one thing that is attracting immigration to Canada, and that is, the engagement before arrival of **British** subjects.

* I quite agree with those honorable members who say that the Commonwealth Government must sooner or later take over **British** New Guinea.

* As our silver is to be coined in England, the **British** Government will have complete control over the quantity issued and will be able to see that the right is not being abused.

* That being so, is it not possible to have with the **British** Government an arrangement by which English silver to the extent of  2  will be legal tender in Austrafia, and Australian silver up to  2  will be legal tender in England ?

* There is no more likelihood of pur Government, abusing the privilege than there is of the **British** Government doing so.

* The **British** Indian Government .have chosen a different coinage.

* No; I want the Treasurer, who, by reason of .his high office, is in touch with the **British** Government, to make with them an arrangement by which their 'silver coinage will be legal tender in Australia to the extent of  2,  and Australian silver coinage will be legal tender in England to the extent of  2.

* I re- cognise the necessity for distinguishing the coins but the Treasurer might show real statesmanship by trying to make an arrangement with the **British** Government - it may be made after the Bill is passed - by which it shall be understood' that English silver shall be current coin in Australia, and Australian silver current coin in England.

* If Australia were not infested with Kyabramese, if she had fabulous sums of money to spend for various purposes, she could build a very useful adjunct to the **British** Navy, and I should not be opposed to the adoption of that course.

* 200,000,000 at .least is the value of the **British** Navy to-day, the yearly expenditure upon which amounts to from 35,000,000 to 39,000,000.

* I regard the future of Australia, except as part of the **British** Empire, as absolutely and utterly hopeless.

* The honorable member for Bland does not claim that Australia is not part of the **British** Empire, but when he pointed out that the contribution which is being asked for would be a mean contribution if we were part of the Empire, he inferred that we are not.

* There might be six men-of-war in Australian waters, which, if they joined the **British** squadron, would turn the tide of battle.

* Finally, a navy costing 200,000 yearly, with no provision for initial expenses, would simply expose us to the derision of the world as a nation, unless we had the **British** flag behind us.

* They prepared a Bill for submission to the **British** Parliament, and the American people approved of it, so far as we can judge, through their accredited representative.

* The point at issue was not the voting of the subsidy, but the fact that the **British** Parliament, unwisely, refused to recognise the local Legislatures in America in dealing with the question of taxation.

* Do not honorable members know - and it is the main question to which any Australian can direct his attention - that only for the **British** flag floating over Australia to-day, if one, at least one, of these nations saw fit, not a boat could leave any of our.

* If Australia were in trouble there would be a muster of **British** ships threshing their way from the Arctic Circle, from the sweltering Caribbean, from the coast of China, from all parts of the world.

* The **British** Navy was not built for the protection of Britain alone, but for the protection of the Empire ; the ships would come from Africa, from the Mediterranean, and from Britain itself.

* And what a marvellous spectacle it will be if ever the fiery cross goes out to the **British** Navy that it is wanted in Australia.

* selfabnegation and self-denial of the **British** people ever since.

* No one doubts the valour of the **British** tar; and it is because I have visions of the strength of Britain - because I believe in the cohesive action of the navy under all circumstances - that I urge that under no circumstances ought Imperial and Australian interests to be divided, and that under no circumstances ought we to ungraciously refuse the small subsidy which is asked.

* No ; we do not get all this for 200,000 - we get it because we form part of the **British** people.

* We have done with old world legends and the troubles of the past - with the anxieties, and brutalities which separated the triple nations in the past - and we have to live only for the future - 
We pledge ourselves not only to the native soil of this sea-girt continent, but to every land over which the **British** flag flies ; and in every one of those lands each man will be found prepared to do his duty when the Empire calls.

* The present position at which Australia has arrived as a dependency of the **British** Crown was marvellously foretold by a well-known Professor of Oxford University when delivering a series of addresses on  Tlie Colonization qf /.he Colonies  in the years 1839-40.

* May we not figure to ourselves, scattered thick as stars over the surface of this earth, communities of citizens owning the name of Britons, bound by allegiance to a **British** Sovereign,' and uniting heart and hand in maintaining the supremacy of Britain on every shore which her unconquered flag can.

* We are here now, one of the " stars " of the surface of the earth, bound by allegiance to the **British** Sovereign; and surely our action in South Africa and China has shown that we are prepared to stand side by side with Great Britain " oh every shore which her unconquered flag can reach," and to remain part and parcel of the Empire for good or ill, for weal or woe.

* It was pointed out by the honorable member for Richmond that it would be disastrous to  have any division of control as between the **British** Navy and an Australian Squadron.

* The  Spectator  of 2nd November, 1889, at the time  Sir Henry  Parkes brought forward a project for Aus tralian Federation, said this : - 
Judging from the public opinion expressed in England when that power was given to us, I think that the **British** people expected us to establish an Australian Navy, which would be a help to England - at any rate, in these waters, and the honorable and learned member for Bendigo very properly asks whether we are to abrogate that political right, and abandon the great duty which was placed upon us by the Constitution of providing sufficient defence for the people of Australia.

* But I should like to ask my honorable and learned friend, and those who are associated with him on the other side of the House, whether they have always been so keen in their demonstration of loyalty to the country which has done so much for them  1  I should like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs, with his self-contained policy for a country which, on the showing of the Prime Minister, is not capable of defending its industries, or the hearths and homes of 'its people, what was he prepared  to do, so far as loyalty to England is concerned, if he and his supporters had had their way  1  Not one single ton of **British** goods would have been allowed to pass into the ports of Australia.

* They seem to think that they have done their duty when they have paid over 200,000 to the **British** Government.

* Every great industry we build up - every legitimate industry - is a proof of the enterprise of the **British** people in Australia.

* At that time there was  a  general review of the conditions of past contracts for the carriage of mails between the State Governments, the **British** Government, and various steam-ship companies, and it is, therefore, not necessary for me to go back again into what is ancient history by giving the amounts paid in each case, and showing how, step by step, conditions have been  improved,  by obtaining accelerated speed, larger vessels, and  a  better service.

* The first contract of which I shall speak is that for a weekly service, made in 1897, between the Australian States, the **British** Government, and the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Steam-ship Companies.

* The subsidy paid under that contract was 170,000, of which the Australian States paid 72,000 and the **British** Government 98,000.

* That contract expired on the 31st January, 1905, and was followed by a contract between the **British** Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company for  a  fortnightly service, the period of transit being accelerated from 686 to 662 hours, and the subsidy increased by about 10,000.'

* It is difficult to ascertain the exact amount of the increase, because the contract is for the carriage of mails to the East  as  well as to Australia, but the period of three years, for which  it  has force,may be extended  to  ten years, and  it is  provided that,  if  there is an extension, the **British** Government shall be entitled to  a  reduction of subsidy.

* The period of three years after which the contract may or may not be extended terminates simultaneously with the period of the contract between the Commonwealth Government and the Orient Steam-ship Company, when; in all probability, the **British** Government will probably try to enforce a new set of conditions similar to those which we shall enforce under the contract which the House is now being asked to ratify.

* The subsidy now given to the Orient Company is ^120,000 a year, an increase upon that paid under the contract with the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies and the **British** Government, to which I have already referred.

* What brought about the existence of two separate contracts, one between the **British** Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and the other between the Commonwealth and the Orient Company, was our legislation, indorsed by the people of this country, requiring that white labour only shall be employed on steamers subsidized for the carriage of Australian mails.

* That criticism was silenced bv pointing out that a similar provision exists in the **British** contract, and io most other contracts.

* It was pointed out, however, that conscription is a thing at variance with **British** ideas of what is right, and opposed to Australian sentiment ; and it is an instance of the good results obtained from the criticism of  that Bill, and of the aptitude of the Minister to feel the public pulse, that the conscription provisions have been dropped.

* The superintendent of the **British** arsenal has computed that the ammunition expended  by the small arms used during the Transvaal war was five times as much as was expended during theFrancoGerman war, and that three times asmuch big gun ammunition was fired away in South Africa as was exploded in France and Germany during the war between thosetwo countries.

* The quality of the leather is diminished by weighting, and from this would arise a disinclination on the part of **British** and foreign buyers to deal in Australian leather.

* Such depreciation may well have been a factor in the conditions which have led to the recent decline in the amount of value of leather exported from Victoria to the United Kingdom, as well as to its exclusion from the **British** War Office contracts, and there is little reason to doubt that one of the reasons owing to which Australian leather has become more or less discredited, is that to some extent at least it can be spoken of as poisoned leather.

* We have to hold and maintain this country as a part of the **British** Empire, and to so develop its resources that it shall become an important part of the Empire, peopled by a white race, preserving the highest standards of the civilization of which we are so proud.

* South Australia, for a period of forty-six years, has had the responsibility of this Territory; and I think that that State is entitled to a meed of praise for having kept the **British** flag flying over that great portion of the Commonwealth.

* But for the benefit of Australia as a whole, as it ultimately proved - though probably selfish considerations may have actuated some of her citizens - South Australia has resolutely faced the position all these years, and tried to do her best- 
There was the alternative of abandoning the Territory, but South Australia has acted according to **British** tradition, and borne a great burden rather than sacrifice the Territory.

* But there is nothing to prevent an American or an European, or, if we like, a **British** firm, from sending, the most injurious liquid?

* If the House is convinced that while the Bill provides that whatever comes into Australia shall be properly described for the few minutes or hours during which it is passing the Customs barrier, it can be used for all sorts of fraudulent purposes after it has come into the territory, and it is of opinion that although goods are required to be truthfully described and defined whilst they are passing the Customs (barrier for the purpose of exportation to the **British** and European public, the marks can afterwards be altered to any extent, then we are not succeeding in our purpose.

* The honorable member for Wide Bay, in speaking on the amendment of the honorable member for Barrier, said many nasty things against private enterprise; but I claim that private enterprise has made the **British** nation.

* Yes; but the **British** Government gets its warships built by  private enterprise, and I am proud to be a Britisher.

* Britishers know more about shipbuilding and shipping than  any  other nation in the world, and if it were wise for the Government to have fleets of merchantmen as well as fleets of war vessels, the **British** Government would have such fleets.

* The honorable member got quite wild at the thought of the **British** people running an Australian mail service, and yet he proposed to go to Great Britain to borrow money to enable us to run boats of our own.

* In this connexion I would direct the attention of honorable members to the recent remarks of a great **British** statesman, because they exactly express my own sentiments. '

* For all the purposes of naval defence and **British** supremacy, the people of the Commonwealth are exactly in the same position as are those of the United Kingdom.

* Is it to be suggested, then, that while we are willing to participate in all the advantages conferred upon us by being **British** subjects, we are unwilling to assist in bearing the burdens of the naval defence of the Empire to the smallest extent  1  Shall we say - "Let our countrymen- in the mother land continue to pay 34,000,000 annually?

* We should have the strong arm, good will, and affection of the mother country, which has never deserted, and will never desert, the **British** people wherever they may be.

* The honorable member would not trust any one, not even those who hold the reins of power, in trust for the **British** race throughout the world, in the mother country.

* A time may come when our flag is stricken down, when all sorts of dangers may surround us, but to my mind - and one feels proud in the conviction - that little bit of bunting which flies from the **British** vessel of war is the greatest protection upon the oceans of the world that any nation, however rich or powerful, has ever had.

* Such is the force that represents the extent pf our danger from raid - 1,000 men of a landing force, on the decks of one to four unarmoured cruisers, which have to come across the wide ocean, and get past the **British** fleets.

* That is no light undertaking; if we have the slightest notion of the strength of the **British** Navy to-day, it represents no small adventure.

* I think, from the information I have gained, that our commerce was never more efficiently protected than it is to-day by the **British** fleets.

* How lias Great Britain, with millions of human being on the brink of want and starvation, discharged hee obligations even to this distant Commonwealth, remote to the furthest point from the centre of her Imperial strength?- Referring to her expenditure - and that talks more loudly than the most eloquent peroration, because it comes out of the pockets of the **British** people - I find that her naval expenditure has been nearly doubled within the last few years.

* Those poor people across the seas spend  40,000,000  a year on the upkeep of **British** fleets, and in the building of new ships, and about  30,000,000  a year in the maintenance of the **British** military forces.

* We have heard of the sudden rise of other navies, and have been told that the power of the **British** arm is becoming paralyzed, that the strengh of the **British** Navy is failing in comparison with that of the navies of other countries.

* Only the other day,  250  **British** war vessels were gathered for a series of manoeuvres in the North Sea.

* Captain Creswell, the very able naval officer in the Commonwealth service, has reported to the Prime Minister, as the result of his recent visit to England, that the **British** Navy of to-day is three times as strong as it was ten years ago.

* protect the commerce of the **British** Empire, which includes that of Australia.

* Under the protection of the **British** flag are the oceans not secure for Australian commerce?

* Australia has been represented as endeavouring to get out of this solemn agreement, ratified by Act of Parliament, in order to abstract our contribution of ,200,000 a year from the pockets of the **British** taxpayers, of whom 12,000,000 are said, I think absurdly, to be on the verge of starvation.

* The **British** people have been told that the agreement has never been popular in.

* pockets of the **British** taxpayer to spend on: our own concerns.

* If we are too poor to afford a contribution of ^200,000 towards the .40, 000,000 necessary for the upkeep of the **British** Fleet, let us say so to the grand old Mother, who has stood by us in all our troubles, and she will forgive us.

* No; but I have none of that spurious pride which feels degraded: by the protection of the **British** Fleet.

* I wish to contrast the attitude of the Prime Minister, who so ill represented the opinions of the majority of" members, with that of the **British** Government.

* I went on to reiterate in the strongest possible language that in view of the enormous benefits we derived from the **British** Navy we could not shrink from supporting this miserable contribution of 200,000 a year, and I voted for it.

* I wonder what would become of the **British** Navy if it were administered on those lines?

* The idea of new mail steamers was grand, and equally grand was the idea for better transit for our produce; but it was ineffably mean to try to take 200,000 out of the pockets of the **British** taxpayers', so that we might obtain those advantages.

* If we choose to enter upon a naval defence policy, it cannot be because the **British** 
In that speech we had an endorsement of our policy as it "had been built up for years.

* Let me ask my honorable friends1 whether they are concerned with the financial side of this new departure, unprecedented in any country inhabited by the **British** race.

* The honorable member for West Sydney submitted a proposition that all **British** subjects who had been six months in the Commonwealth, and who were from eighteen to twenty-one years of age, should be subject to compulsory military training.

* The **British** Fleet, being our main naval defence, must be under one Executive control.

* It is the **British** Government that would be responsible for every shot fired by our.

* The responsibility in time of war is absolutely with- the Imperial Government and the **British** people, not with Australia.

* It would be dangerous to "leave a young group of loyal and good subjects in a position to compromise the vast responsibilities of the **British** Empire.

* Should they start for the Antipodes, **British** war vessels would get there as soon.

* With regard to what has been said about the Rangoon candles, I wish to inform honorable members that I have learnt from a reliable source that it is only the poorest kind of labour that can be hired in **British** India for 4d.

* a day, and that the coolies employed in making candles in Rangoon are paid a rate which approximates, in **British** money, is.

* When French marines had been landed at the New Hebrides to complete the annexation of those islands, one State more than any other, namely, Victoria, and one man in that State more than any other - the late Honorable James Service - took strong action, and in the end secured the attention of the **British** Government and the removal of the French marines.

* Whilst 1 am quite conscious of the apathy that has been displayed bv our own people, and I recognise the difficulties which beset the Imperial Government, with interests which girdle the world, I think that of late years the subject of **British** interests in the Pacific has not received the attention to which it has been entitled at the hands of the Imperial authorities.

* Various interchanges have been made between the **British** and French Governments, and old disputes and unsettled claims have been arranged, but we have heard no mention of the New Hebrides, and I think the time has arrived when we should respectfully' and clearly - more clearly even than in the motion - express our opinions in support of the various Commonwealth Ministries that have made representations on the subject.

* He was a **British** resident, and afterwards became a naturalized French settler.

* If the money so paid away had really been devoted to the purpose for which it was obtained the **British** would to-day be out of court, so far as the New Hebrides are concerned.

* The .slight encouragement given by Australia to **British** settlers and traders in the group enabled them at least to maintain something like an equal contest  with the French whilst the conditions were fair, but at present a most unfair set of conditions exists.

* in the group have far greater advantages than are enjoyed by the **British** settlers.

* In the first place, they are receiving monetary assistance from the French Government; secondly, a sort of colonization, based on special inducements given by France, is taking place; and, thirdly, claims are allowed to be made by French companies and individuals for large areas of land in the New Hebrides which, if preferred bv **British** claimants, would bt at once thrown out of court by the **British** Commissioner.

* In my opinion, the attention of the **British** Government should be called to the desirableness of having the Commission so constituted that the settlements will be likely to be just, prompt, and effective.

* That all the words after the word " That," line 1, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words " the representations already made by the Governments of the Commonwealth to the **British** Government in regard to the New Hebrides should, in the interests of the natives, the settlers, and Australia, be renewed and strengthened.

* On many occasions the natives have given evidence that they prefer the control of the **British** to that of the French.

* A complete representation could not be made by a people so situated, but they have, at all events, represented their preference for **British** occupation.

* Those who know anything of the New Hebrides must be aware that the preference of the natives for **British** rule is undoubted.

* Such an idea is opposed to the very best traditions of the **British** race.

* What is the basis of the distribution of the 500 voted by Parliament to assist **British** settlers in the New Hebrides who suffered loss owing to the effect of the Commonwealth Tariff upon their produce?

* How many **British** settlers have received direct relief from the disbursement of the500, and to what extent in each case?

* In the meantime Lieutenant-Governor of **British** New Guinea is much embarrassed, and quite unable to perform duty administering affairs of Government.

* Lower down will be found a cable from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Commonwealth Government stating that the question of **British** New Guinea is most urgent, and expressing the hope that Ministers will deal with it as soon as possible.

* This proposal is more than temporary in character, in so far as it is intended that **British** New Guinea should be distinctly attached to the Commonwealth as a territory.

* Of course, in its strict acceptation, annexation implies the addition to the possessions of the **British** Crown of some territory which was not formerly within the bounds of the Empire.

* The honorable member is well aware that New Guinea for many years past has been annexed, and is part of the **British** Empire.

* First of all, I do not think the honorable member will submit that the **British** Government, considering the proximity of New Guinea to Australia, is in a better position either to control its affairs or to provide men more capable of conducting them than is the Commonwealth.

* The time when the progress of settlement will press upon those lines which divide **British** territory from territory which is not **British** is perhaps very far removed.

* When they do arise - if ever they do - there is no reason to suppose that they will not be as effectually dealt with by the **British** Government because the officials of the administration happen to be under the control of the Commonwealth, or because the settlers in New Guinea chance in some degree to be allied to the Commonwealth, as they would be if the Imperial Government were in control through its own agents.

* But I submit that there is no greater danger to be apprehended from trusting our own officials than there is from trusting the ordinary officials of the **British** Government.

* I say nothing derogatory to the organization of the **British**  Foreign-office  They are extremely hard to move by our appeals, but, according to the testimony from all parts of the Empire, they are harder still to move by the officials of their own Government.

* If we look forward to a somewhat jealous shepherding of any rights which we possess in New Guinea, it seems to me that they are far more likely to be efficiently protected if we depend upon our own officials than if we depend on those appointed by the **British** Colonial-office.

* It has hitherto been a maxim which the Empire has not been able to afford to disregard, that where a **British** subject goes protection must follow him.

* I am urging on the honorable member for New England that this country, and the settlement of its lands, so far as settlement can take place for the purpose of tropical development, should be undertaken under efficient control, and not left to chartered companies 10,000 miles away from the **British** Colonialoffice.

* If the **British** Government had not practically renounced responsibility for the control of affairs in New Guinea, had not indicated their absolute unwillingness to spend another shilling in connexion with that territory, and had not urged on the Commonwealth that it was our duty to undertake this task, we should not now be pressing the consideration of this question on honorable members.

* I do not mean to assert that the **British** Government will haul down the flag again.

* The **British** Government hauled the flag down once, and we are not likely to forget the circumstances.

* The one object we have in asking that **British** New Guinea shall be made a territory of the Commonwealth, is that we may have supreme legislative control.

* But if the auriferous, or if the tropical resources of **British** New Guinea prove to be what we expect they will be, we may look forward to a steady increase of revenue.

* This resolution will enable the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to finance **British** New Guinea to the extent of 20,000 a year until the Bill of which I have spoken is submitted to Parliament : and I hope that will be very early in the new year.

* Their proposal would not involve the objectionable conditions proposed by the former chartered companies for dealing with **British** New Guinea.

* We shall be able to attain those ends if **British** New Guinea becomes our territory, but should certainly not be able to guarantee the same results if we leave it under the control of those at a distance who are less interested in its fortunes than the Australian people are, and always must be.

* No one can vote for this resolution unless he is prepared to become for all time an Imperialist Then, too, we must not forget that if we claim the right to interfere in the affairs of other parts of the **British** Empire, we must also grant them the right to interfere in our affairs.

* To me it appears that this resolution constitutes the first step that any Parliament in any portion of the **British** Dominions has taken in the direction of Imperialism and in the direction of handing over for deposit in what may be called the " national crucible," all the legislation which may be enacted in any part of the Empire.

* No doubt we are,, but if we agree to this resolution honorable members will understand that for ali time we must cease to feel indignant at any attempted interference with our legislation, or at any suggestions which may be made to us bv other parts of the **British** Empire.

* I am sure we are all agreed that there are several serious and far-reaching possibilities involved in the consideration of this question, and perhaps none is so important as that mentioned by the honorable member for New England and referred to by the Attorney-General, in speaking of the position we may ultimately land ourselves in if we take over the **British** possession of New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth.

* I refer to that as showing the difficulty which will arise hereafter in connexion with the annexation of New Guinea in the event of our taking over the **British** possession as a territory of the Commonwealth.

* I understand it is generally conceded that the natives of New Guinea, and especially of the **British** possession, are of Polynesian descent, the same as the New Zealanders, the Tahitians, and the Samoans.

* The inland natives are, I believe, of a different character, but around the coast in the Dutch and German, as well as in the **British** portion of New Guinea, they are people whomay, in the course of a quarter of a century, perhaps, claim to have representation in any State which may be annexed to the Commonwealth.

* Looking at the history of the Empire it seems to me that all outlying portions of it have first passed through the nursery stage of Crown colonies, and I do not see why, if the **British** Government is properly approached, they should wish to depart from that policy in connexion with the development of New Guinea.

* Practically the nursery stage of all our colonies and of every colonial possession of the **British** Empire has been that of a Crown colony.

* There is, I think, a very much stronger reason why **British** New Guinea should be  administered by  the Imperial authorities, and that was referred to by the honorable members for Wentworth and New England.

* In the case of the Basutoland territory, and evidently for a special purpose, the most modern attitude of the **British** Government appears to have been adopted in this respect.

* In almost every **British** colonial possession land troubles have led to wars of the kind, and it is one of the matters which requires to be most carefully considered in dealing with this question.

* The Channel fleet and the fleet in the North sea can guard practically the whole of the **British** coast, but here no fleet except one of such enormous dimensions that neither' could Australia for a moment contemplate maintaining it nor the Empire contemplate supplying it, would be sufficient to secure our shores against raids.

* I sincerely trust that the cablegram which appeared in the press the other day to the effect that the Commander-in-Chief of the **British** Army, Lord Roberts, had abolished the ceremonial portion of the drill in the drill-book is true.

* The balance of 1,303,000 came from other parts of the **British** Empire or foreign countries.

* ?150,000 worth from **British** Possessions, and that the imports from the same sources into New Zealand were valued at ,?60,000.

* That is to say, over ?^200,000 worth of goods which last year were imported from **British** Possessions will be excluded.

* It is proposed later on to extend preference to Great Britain ; but I would point out that if the Government scheme were carried out we could not divert into **British** channels as much trade as that which' it is now proposed to divert from such channels by this treaty.

* It means the exclusion of **British** hops from both New Zealand and Australia.

* I assume that we can divert into **British** channels 150,000 worth of the 750,000 worth of foreign trade that we now carry on in respect of the articles enumerated in the schedule.

* In addition, we shall exclude 150,000 worth of trade from **British** Possessions elsewhere.

* Consequently, although we 'may hope by these preference proposals to divert 150,000 worth of '**British** trade to Australia, we shall, under the operation of the two treaties, exclude from the rest of the **British** Empire over 300,000 worth of trade.

* Accepting the very lowest computation, the two proposals of the Government will exclude upon the balance nearly 350,000 worth of **British** trade from Australia.

* Here is a proposal which aims at giving the rest of the Empire something, but which, in reality, excludes more trade than we can divert into **British** channels.

* The only party to the whole arrangement which will derive any benefit from it will be Australia, which scores very solidly both under the New Zealand and under the **British** treaty in the direction of protection.

* That is the outstanding result of these treaty negotiations, and I submit that it does not represent a spirit of concession such as we ought to contemplate when entering into these closer relationships, and when endeavouring in a practical way to divert into **British** channels the trade which is now being done by foreign countries, since that is acknowledged to be one of the means by which we can foster the Empire sentiment, and bring about that consolidation of the union which is so much to be desired.

* The Dominion notes are backed bv 15 per cent, of gold, and 10 per cent, of Dominion debentures guaranteed by the **British** Government.

* We have at the present time under our Constitution no responsibility to the **British** Empire.

* The responsibility for the conduct of the affairs of the **British** Empire lies at the present time with the Imperial Government and the Imperial Executive.

* In this connexion I am glad to be able to quote from  Hansard,  page 4816, where the Attorney-General is reported as having said - 
At the instance of Japan, it is announced that Great Britain has persuaded the Government of the Dominion of Canada to disallow the **British** Columbia Bill, which sought to impose an educational test, with the object of excluding Chinese and Japanese immigrants, and also to forbid their employment oncertain Government works.

* To speak straight out was once the **British** way of doing things, and it is extraordinary that we Britishers cannot speak out as we ought to do and as we used to do.

* It strikes me that the **British** Empire has fallen very low indeed when we cannot say straight out what sort of men we desire within the Empire.

* Difficulties would be created if Australia adopted the metric system of measurements ; but Great Britain is beginning to find that, if she is to hold her own in the markets of the world, she must be prepared to adopt the system of measures used by France and other countries, and some of her engineering manufacturers are now prepared to supply orders in accordance with either the metric or the **British** standard.

* Although Committees and Commissions in the Old Country 'have reported almost unanimously in favour of a decimal system of coinage for Great Britain, and the florin was adopted as a step towards the decimalization of the **British** coinage, the reform has been delayed, partly because of the conservatism of thought there, partly from fear of prejudice, many of her people not being as well educated as ours, and partly because of the greatness of her trade.

* The coinage proposed would have followed as closely as possible the present **British** currency, and, on a former occasion, I offered, while on my feet, to calculate without the aid of pencil and paper, the transposition to the proposed decimal coinage of any sum that might be named in the present currency.

* The only difficulty I see is in regard to patterns and gauges being made to **British** standards.

* But I am not saying that it is so difficult that it should not be done, because, while we might decimalize our measures as a matter of national policy, private individuals could always take **British** measurements or adopt **British** standards if they wished to do so in respect to pulleys, wheels, templates, and so on.

* When we ' have Standing Orders which are backed by the high authority of the **British** Parliament, we ought to adhere -to them ; and I submit that the requested amendment is not in order.

* When I asked why the Imperial authorities should have denied us the right to place on our coins what words we thought fit to use; he said that, under the Royal Titles Act of 1901 a certain proclamation had been issued adding to His Majesty's previous title the words " and of the **British** Dominions beyond the seas."

* the following addition shall be made to the Style and Titles at present appertaining to the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom and its dependencies; that is to say ... in the English tongue, after the words " of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland," these words "and of the **British** Dominions beyond the Seas."

* The title, therefore, reads not " Emperor of India and of the **British** Dominions beyond the Seas," but  " Edward VII.'

* by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the **British** Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India."

* The phrase " and of the **British** Dominions beyond the Seas " is inserted before the word "King," and "Emperor of India"  strictly  limits the title of Emperor to the Indian Dominions.

* If the Treasurer is acting under misconception as to the words " and of the **British**  Dominions  beyond the Seas" being added at the end of the list of titles, perhaps he will see his way to graciously yield to what is undoubtedly the desire of honorable members.

* .- The effect of the distinction which will be established under this proposal will be to destroy the **British** export of tobacco to Australia, and to advance the foreign export.

* rule out the **British** trade with Australia in tobacco.

* Notwithstanding the absence of the leader of the Opposition, for reasons about which I am not called upon to express an opinion, J think that, as the Prime Minister has just returned from a visit to the old country, where he took part in a Conference with representatives from all parts of the **British** Empire, he had no justification for withholding from the House information as to what was done there.

* The Government ought, however, to insist on an effort being made to obtain labour in the **British** Dominions before the representatives of those engaged in the sugar industry are permitted to seek it in foreign countries.

* In my opinion the agents of the sugar planters in Queensland have made no serious effort up to the present time to get **British** labour.

* But we cannot have an Australian Navy at the present time, and I hope the day is far distant when we shall have an Australian Navy which will be absolutelydissociated from the **British** Navy.

* I venture to say, however - and I think that the assertion cannot be contradicted - that the policy of a white Australia would not have been thought of, and certainly would not have been proposed, if we had not had the **British** Navy at our backs to support it.

* Therefore it seems to me that the labour party are wrong in decrying the **British** Navy and the **British** connexion, and in saying that we want an Australian Navy.

* We never could have carried out the white Australia policy but for the backing we knew we should obtain from Great Britain and the **British** Navy.

* We must trust the Admiralty, which will have charge of the Australian Squadron, as it has charge of the rest of the **British** fleet.

* Instead of taking ships away from us in time of need to protect **British** interests elsewhere, the inclination of Great Britain would rather be to send us her last ship, her last man, and to spend her last shilling to defend us if we required her help.

* The ideal underlying the **British** system of government is that the will of the people shall prevail.

* I contend that, from the first, the ideal of the **British** Constitution was that the will of the people should prevail.

* The **British** statesmen of this period are those of whom we have least reason to be proud, as the rascals of" the same period are those of whom we have most reason to be ashamed.

* He came at a time when the discordant elements in the **British** Parliament were at their worst.

* was brought almost to the verge of 'despair in dealing with the turbulent Commons, Sunderland, one of the greatest rascals in **British** history - he was probably second only to  Jeffreys  - volunteered a plan by which the King could secure a stable Government, and still give satisfaction to the people of England.

* After detailing some of the circumstances to which I have already referred, Macaulay says at page 452 - 
The writer is hardly justified in using the expression " is left as in England," seeing that the **British** Constitution is an unwritten one, and he might have gone further with regard to our own Constitution, and have said that ail that has been done is to establish a parliamentary Executive of a certain character for purposes of initiation, and pending the creation by Parliament of an Executive.

* Any Government might be credited with wisdom in following a precedent of so well respected and honoured a Parliament as is the Mother Parliament of **British** Legislatures.

* Viewing their  Speaker,  as they have done throughout their history, as the recognised defender of minorities and the rights of individual members, the **British** Parliament enacted that this form of closure should not be enforced except with his concurrence and assent.

* That, in my opinion, is a departure from **British** precedent which is certainly not warranted by our experience of the operation of the **British** standing order, and  it  shows at once that the object underlying this particular motion is a purely party one.

* I am endeavouring to point out that the particular phraseology adopted in the proposed Standing Orders confuses "question" and "motion" in a way that is not in accord with the Standing Orders of the **British** House of Commons, or with our own Standing Orders, precedents, and practice.

* I have read 'many pages of  May  in, order to refresh my memory, and I contend that the second word, " motion," in the first paragraph of the proposed standing order, should be "question," in order to make the meaning clear, and iri accordance with our Standing Orders, and also those of the **British** House of Commons.

* This proposed standing order, like the standing order of the **British** House of Commons, gives power to carry the decision of the House or Committee to its logical conclusion by completing the business before it is interrupted by an adjournment or by a transfer from the consideration of one piece of business to the consideration of another.

* 471, at p. 474,  Dr. Lushington  said : - " I never said that if it pleased the **British** Parliament to make laws as to foreigners out of the jurisdiction Courts of Justice must not execute them.

* Thus the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, 17 and 18 Victoria, chapter 104, s. 267, enacted, "that all  offences committed at any place out of **British** dominions by any seaman who at the time when the offence was committed or  within three  months previosuly  had been employed in any **British** ship " shall be liable to be tried at the Central Criminal Court.

* In  Regina  v.  Anderson  (1868) L.B., 1, C.C.R., 161, an American serving on board a **British** ship was indicted at the Old Bailey for the murder of a sailor while the ship was in the River Garonne in Prance.

* As a general rule, no doubt, we should construe a **British** statute according to the principles of international law, and confine a legislative enactment to a **British** subject or to a person subject to **British** protection."

* We want to show that it is in the interests of imperial unity ; in the interests of the integrity of the **British** Empire itself, because, if we admit these mixed races, it will only lead - as it always has done - to complications.

* It is said by competent judges that we cannot produce cocoa and chocolate of such excellent quality and character as is that of **British** manufacture.

* It is only by a lifetime of careful chemical research, as well as by the employment of the most up-to-date machinery and the most skilled workmen, that it is possible to obtain such a high standard of excellence as that which the **British** manufacturers have achieved.

* Any attempt - " Any," mind you ; it is not limited - to impose disqualifications on the basis of such distinctions, besides being offensive to a friendly power is contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of **British** rule throughout the Empire.

* Mr. Chamberlain  has been assured that any distinctions based on race and colour are not only contrary to the conceptions of the **British** Empire, which the present Federal Ministry have developed, but that the Ministry are not likely to submit any legislation conflicting with  Mr. Chamberlain's  views.

* -The clause may include **British** subjects.

* Yes ; the definition will include any **British** subjects.

* Surely this Government of humanity and toleration will not descend to these methods of legislation simply because the islanders of the Pacific are friendless, or because they have no material strength or resources behind them to avenge this outrage on their colour and nationality  1  This Bill seems to me a fitting ending to the hypocritical beginning which was made with the other measure, after all the professions of consideration for humanity and the adoption of the basic principles on which the **British** Empire is built.

* One of those principles is that when a man of any colour gets beneath the **British** flag he is safe.

* .- I do not think it is necessary to stipulate that **British** goods to which preferential treatment is extended shall be made by white **British** workmen ; because very few coloured people are employed in the manufacturing industries of England, and I am afraid that it would be very difficult to enforce compliance with a condition that the only goods entitled to preference shall be made in England by Britishers or naturalized Britishers.

* I heartily support the second portion of the amendment relating to ships carrying preference goods being manned exclusively by white **British** seamen.

* - The reason why I ask the honorable member for Kalgoorlie not to press this portion of his amendment is because of the insuperable difficulty of determining whether or not particular goods have been manufactured by " **British** citizens.

* It is true that there are factory inspectors in Great Britain, but it is not part of their duty to ascertain whether or not the persons engaged in the manufacture of goods are **British** citizens.

* The amendment would operate against goods whose production was to any extent, no matter  howslight,  assisted by white persons who  are  not **British** citizens.

* That after the word " ships," the following words be added : "manned exclusively by white **British** seamen."

* Is there any hardship, or anything contrary to **British** justice, in throwing the onus of proof on the defendant in these cases?

* When we remember that on many occasions we have been told by the honorable gentleman, and by his late leader, the right honorable member for East Sydney, that this compulsion is repugnant to the genius of the **British** people- r-whatever .

* They could easily .be remedied without recourse to this system, which was in its very nature repugnant to the genius of the **British** race, and imposed an intolerable thrall upon the people.

* We do not know what they are to be paid, or whether they are liable to be taken from these ships and transferred willy-nilly to **British** ships in another .part of the world.

* We do not know whether the fleet is to be partly reinforced by a **British** squadron in these waters.

* We do not know whether, if that is the case, the **British** Vice-Admiral will have command of the whole squadron, including the Australian ships.

* To take an Australian vessel, into which men volunteer for service; and transfer it to the China or the Atlantic station, or to the Home Fleet, is in effect to make this a contribution in kind to the **British** Navy.

* If the fleet is at any' time likely to be transferred as a whole, and it can always be transferred in part, to different parts of the world, it is to be in effect a contribution in kind to the **British** Navy, towards the cost of which we shall, therefore, pay to the tune practically of  1, 000,000  per annum.

* I have shown that, in the opinion of the greatest **British** soldier of the day, that period is wholly inadequate.

* I subscribe to a sane Imperialism involved in the necessity of preserving the integrity of the **British** Empire.

* I should not be particular whether immigrants were **British**, German, Italian, or from any other European country, so long as they were prepared to go on the  land, and presented material of which good colonists could be made.

* further, that there is no provision made in this clause for reciprocal action, such as is contemplated" in the case of **British** Possessions.

* Some of the States have entered into reciprocal arrangements among themselves, and I see no reason why we should not follow a similar practice in regard to **British** Possessions and foreign countries.

* - I ask the honorable and learned member for Corio to consider whether the insertion of the words " foreign state or " before the words "**British** Possession" in clause 100 would not achieve the object which we both have in view.

* If we applied that provi sion to foreign countries, as well as to **British** possessions, we should insure that we should receive reciprocal .rights from those countries, and we should give our own representative of the Crown the power to call this latent legislation into existence.

* It was pointed out that both nations had been willing, for several years, to regulate the emigration of their subjects to the **British** Possessions and America., that the whole matter could be arranged by treaty, and that under the operation of these treaties, quite as great a restriction would be imposed upon the subjects of those nations, as would be effected by the restrictive legislation of the various colonies.

* The obligations incurred in connexion with the  Times  edition were met by the Japanese in a way which was exceptional, when compared with the honesty of the **British** people themselves.

* Our **British** Government sent one of their best soldiers to visit Japan, and after a considerable stay there, and a thorough inspection of their military system, he made a report, of which a copy was given to the War Office in London, in which it was stated that the tropical portion of Australia was considered by Japan as her natural heritage, and that in every school the soldiers from their earliest enlistment were educated to view this position as their inevitable possession, and that all were taught the necessary military methods to acquire it, if ever an occasion arose.

* That was the first occasion, so far as I know, upon which,' in any **British** community, the principle of compulsory service, as we have hitherto understood it, was.

* - If the **British** Navy were wiped off the face of the earth - be cause that is what it comes to - I do not know what would Happen.

* But so long as there are' **British** ships to intercept a line of communications, no armed occupation could be maintained.

* I will go so far as to say that if the Boers had had a fleet which the **British** Navy had failed to wipe off the seas, we could never have carried on the campaign in South Africa, because we could not have relied upon supplies coming forward.

* Assuming for the sake of argument that, instead of the **British** Fleet having blocked up the fleets of the hostile powers, the latter had overcome and rendered the strength of the **British** Navy to such an extent inoperative that they were able to make an invasion, still, if Britain could keep ships afloat, and at liberty to roam the seas, the enemy's lines of communication would unquestionably be disturbed and interfered with, and, as I said before, a continuance of the invasion would be impossible.

* Can any one conceive it possible that during this generation or the next, no matter what advance may be made by other European powers in naval construction - even though Great Britain were to be utterly outbuilt - the **British** Navy will get so far behind, relatively speaking, as not to be in the position I have described?

* A hostile power may, notwithstanding the present enormous preponderance of the **British** Fleet, still be able to avoid the **British** cruisers, and to make raids on our shores ; and for that we should be prepared.

* I do not suggest for one moment that we should depend entirely on the **British** Fleet for our defence.

* To revert for one moment to the **British** Fleet, I desire to point out that, although there has been a redistribution, which has been commented on by the Minister of Defence, and also by the honorable member for West Sydney, as indicating a weakness on.

* the part of the Admiralty, the leading members of both the great political parties in- Great Britain have declared, and continue to declare - and  Mr. Winston  Churchill reiterated only two days ago - that the **British** Government are determined to maintain the two-power standard.

* The only two naval powers in the Pacific at this moment worth considering, from the **British** point of view, are Japan and the United States, one of which is our close ally, and the other, though, perhaps, not actually an ally, is on the most friendly terms with Great Britain.

* Difficulties with Japan  are impossible at the present time, and the same may be said of the United States; and, therefore, the **British** Fleet is taken where it will be able to strike most effectively against any possible enemy.

* So far as one, humanly speaking, can see into the future, our connexion with the Mother Country will certainly last that period, and we shall have the benefit of the protection of the **British** Fleet, or, as it may become known later, the fleet of the Empire.

* difficult questions which the **British** Empire has yet to face - the great race question.

* The **British** militia has provided splendid material for the army, but I would prefer our own militia under the present system, since during the whole year the officers are in constant touch with their men.

* It means the introduction of a principle which the Minister certainly admitted that, so far as he is aware, has never hitherto been introduced in any **British** community.

* Butwhatever steps we may take in that direction as a means of defence,and  whatever methods may be finally adopted for the purpose of qualifying our manhood to maintain that high ideal, we must always bear in mind that, belonging as we do to the greatest combination of nations, the most powerful confederation of peoples that the world has ever seen, it is to our honour, as well as to our interest, to maintain and strengthen the integrity and the pre-eminence of the **British** Empire.

* I believe our capacity to manufacture mining machinery is equal to that of most **British** peoples.

* Whilst I was insisting on the necessity of having goods of the highest possible quality, when they are used so much by infants and invalids, and, in that connexion, was speaking about the excellence of the productions of the **British** manufacturer, I did not wish it to be inferred that I was casting any reflection upon the quality of the Australian product.

* I have taken some trouble to ascertain what is the practice elsewhere, and I find that while in Canada and Cyprus the inscription is in Latin "  Rex Imf erator,"  it is in English "King and Emperor" in **British** East Africa, **British** Honduras, Jamaica, Nigeria, Uganda, **British** Guiana, Hong Kong, and the Straits Settlement.

* But I entirely disagree with the honorable member when he urges that we should begin by making an increased contribution towards the maintenance of the **British** Navy.

* There is a distinction to be drawn between, the **British** Navy, as we now have it, and an Imperial Navy which would be representative of all parts of the Empire, and which would be maintained apart from the **British** Navy proper.

* But my idea is that Australians should depend upon themselves for their own defence; that they should encourage a spirit of local patriotism, which would ultimately render us, so far as Australian defence is concerned, absolutely independent of the **British** Navy.

* It is our duty to de,velop our own resources, to maintain this, country for the **British** race, to keep it free, from foreign domination, either racial or otherwise, and certainly free from conquest: or aggression.

* Our first line of defence is, of course, the **British** Navy.

* At the present time we are spending ^200,000 annually upon the **British** Navy, ^50,000 upon our own Naval Forces, and, roughly speaking, about ,700,000 upon our land forces.

* I do not think that we are in a position to purchase battleships, nor shall we require to do so whilst the **British** Fleet remains supreme upon the seas.

* If there were no **British** Navy in existence, or if by some unthinkable mischance that Navy were disposed of, our position would be still the same as it is to-day.

* It would be our duty to provide a complete system of local defence, and we cannot do that by paying tribute to the **British** Navy.

* What would be our position if an enemy succeeded in defeating the **British** Fleet on the Australian station, and we had no local defence upon which to rely ?

* Surely, whether we increase our contribution to the **British** 
That is a secret.

* I have pointed out that we ought not to rely too fully upon the **British** Navy' for our protection, but that we should take care to see that our coasts are defended by torpedo boats, torpedo destroyers, and other vessels of that class.

* By thus taking steps to preserve the safety of' our own country we shall do more to assist the Empire as a whole than we could by making contributions to either a **British** or an Imperial Navy.

* Any attack upon Australia must come from oversea, and  from  a cruiser or cruisers which succeed in evading the **British** Navy..

* If  Mr. Balfour  be right, it is obvious that, in the event of several cruisers evading the **British** Fleet and making an attack upon our shores, we should be able to defend, ourselves by the possession of torpedo boats, torpedo-boat destroyers, submarines,, and submersibles.

* Because the **British** Navy has to do something more than defend England's hearths and homes.

* No; I assert that we are performing our Imperial duty by maintaining Australia for the **British** races, by undertaking the whole of our local defence - by keeping our defence equipment up to date, and paying for the whole of it ourselves.

* We are carrying out our Imperial duty- by maintaining our own local defence, and preserving Australia for the **British** race.

* If Great 
Britain, by means of her fleet, keeps the trade routes open, and protects the shipping thereon, she does all that Australia can expect of her ; and if we, on the other hand, maintain a complete local defence, provide safe harbors of refuge for our shipping, protect our naval bases, coal supplies, and cities, and, in short, do all that can be done in Australian waters to resist an attack by cruisers which evade the vigilance of the **British** Fleet, we shall performour share of the Imperial duty.

* As long as we remain a part of the Empire, it is the concern, not so much of Australia, as it is of the **British** people.

* It cannot be said that we are performing ourImperial duty by making contributions to the **British** Navy.

* Has Canada, or India, or any other part of the **British** Empire made any contribution to that Navy?

* Some persons go to the length of saying - and the assertion has practically been made in this House - that those who hold that it is wrong for Australia to contribute to the **British** Navy are guilty of disloyalty.

* No doubt some honorable members were not agreed as to the advisableness of the action which was taken by this Parliament in deciding to accept the control of **British** New Guinea, but now that that control has been undertaken by the Commonwealth, anything which cun bc done to further by peaceable means the vesting of the control of the whole island under one authority should, in my opinion, be undertaken.

* The **British** territory in New Guinea embraces about 90,000 square miles.

* It is believed, however, that there are something like 350,000 natives in **British** New Guinea, about 115,000 in the German possessions on the mainland, and 200,000 in the Bismarck Archipelago, and about 200,000 in Dutch New Guinea.

* The white population in **British** New Guinea is about 500.

* But if the whole island were under one control, those difficulties would be no greater, because the problems which have to be dealt with in **British** New Guinea aro much the same as those which have to be dealt with in the German and Butch possessions.

* Undoubtedly, however, one administration would be beneficial to both the native and the white populations, arid, in the interests  of  internal administration and good govern ment, it is desirable that the island should be under the control of one power Although we in this Parliament ure all representatives of the **British**  race,  I think it may bc said without egotism, that the control which would be productive of the best results, is that of the **British**, exercised through the Commonwealth.

* It would, of course, be idle  to  deny that mistakes  have  been committed, and acts done by our people of which we have no reason  to  be proud, but taking everything into consideration, the **British** rule has been more successful, and more productive of good for humanity than that of any other nation which has attempted to colonize.

* Even in New Guinea to-day the benefits of **British** rule are observable when our operations there are compared with those of the Germans and the Sutch.

* We know that the administration of **British** Now Guinea has been virtually starved for tho want of sufficient revenue.

* In German New Guinea the cost of government is greater than in the **British** portion, and yet neither can show anything like the same amount of good solid work.

* For many years to come we must rely upon the **British** Fleet as our first line of defence.

* The sooner the change is made the better it will be, not only for **British** commerce and industry, but also for Australian trade.

* This House should give expression to any feeling which it may entertain in favour of the general adoption of the decimal system, and I am prepared at once to go to that extent, in order if possible to encourage the **British** Government to take the matter in hand without delay.

* If the Treasurer will agree to alter his amendment so that it will give an expression of opinion in favour of the change being made, while intimating at the same time that we await the decision of the **British** Government before taking action, I shall be satisfied.

* **British** fleet met with a serious reverse - and I suppose that is not
            beyond the bounds of possibility - and her ports became blockaded, Great Britain would
            be brought in a very few weeks to her knees to sue for peace, for the simple reason that
            she could not support her own people.

* The **British**
            Parliament has voted over 16,000,000 for the construction of ships and armaments
            alone, quite apart from other naval expenditure.

* We are part of the **British** Empire, and if old England became involved in some
            great crisis and found herself confronted with perhaps two or three first-class European
            powers, it is perfectly true that she could not spare great battleships out here.

* However, what I wish to say is that, whilst I am
                opposed to the construction of a purely Australian Navy, at Australian expense and
                to be under Australian control, I trust the Government will ask the Parliament to
                rise to a proper conception of its responsibility and vote an adequate sum towards
                the support of the **British** Navy.

* With all our talk about patriotism, we are now
                giving an insignificant vote of 126,000 per annum as a contribution from
                United Australia to the **British** Navy.

* I almost wonder that the **British** Government
                accepted it.

* I do not understand quite what was meant by these questions and answers ; but,
                if they mean that the Imperial Government are desirous of enlisting men in Australia
                for service in the **British** Army or Navy, and that our Government will attempt to
                prevent them from exercising that liberty, then I, for one, will be entirely at
                variance with the Government.

* say later on, and I hope that he will express himself to the effect that this
                National Government will not prevent, or attempt to prevent, the enlisting of
                citizens in Australia for service in the **British** Army or Navy, if such citizens
                think fit to enlist.

* in the **British**
                army or navy  1  Great Britain has given up to us
                this magnificent territory, perfectly free from any conditions whatever ; she has
                laid upon us no Imperial obligations, but has trusted to our patriotism.

* During the South African war the **British** Government, which manufactures the cordite required for its own purposes, was not able to cope with the demand, and paid Nobel and Co., of Waltham Abbey - the parent of the factory at Deer Park - 2s.

* That the representations already made by the Governments of the Commonwealth to the **British** Governments in regard to the New Hebrides should, in the interests of the natives, the settlers, and Australia, be renewed and strengthened.

* With our own experience in war - with the experience we have from the generals who are sent out here from the **British** army to -organize our forces from time to time - I feel we are quite competent to pass a satisfactory measure with the assistance of honorable members who have had professional experience.

* If Australia became involved in any great war the **British** navy would have to come to our assistance.

* It is not pleasant to feel that the ships which defend these shores are entirely in the hands of the **British** Government, and that we are taxpayers, but have no voice in their management.

* We are living under the **British** flag, and I suppose we shall be defended by the **British** navy as far as possible should we ever be threatened with invasion.

* I gathered that the honorable member for Fawkner is prepared to differentiate in favour of Cadbury's or any other **British** firm which is granting -fair conditions to its workers.

* Has the Prime Minister seen the following comments in the  Age  newspaper, upon the despatch from the **British** Admiralty, relating to the Australian Naval Defence: - 
While, as was indicated yesterday, it is true that the advances made in the Admiralty's latest communication towards the Australian stand-point are very considerable, it is doubtful whether the Government will be able to accept them without a further effort to induce  Mr. McKenna  and  Sir John  Fisher to realize how absolutely determined the Commonwealth is to secure an adequate coastal navy of her own.

* The Australian Naval Agreement will, if the Admiralty's alternative to  Mr. Deakin's  scheme be accepted by the Government, be profoundly modified, though Sydney Harbor will not be entirely depleted of **British** warships.

* Has the Government proposed, or 'does it contemplate proposing, to the **British** Government any reduction of the **British** Fleet in Australian waters?

* I have fought against the Boers, and have fought with them, and I know their tactics as well as I know the tactics of the **British**.

* It is a wrong conception altogether to suppose that the **British** troops are now fighting against undisciplined and untrained forces.

* They have taken it for granted that the Australian is of the same nature and of the same  capacity  as the man who stands in the rank and tie of the **British** army.

* There never was a. greater calumny than that the **British** army as a whole is uneducated.

* The only difference between Australian soldiers and **British** soldiers is that the former have not been brought under the barrack-room and barrack - yard influence, with the result that they act on their own initiative.

* It cannot be said, however, that because the **British** soldier has not been to college he does not fight as well as men who have had superior advantages.

* The agreement under consideration extends concessions to New Zealand in certain cases, but in all cases it increases the duties operative against the goods of Great Britain and of **British** dependencies.

* I honestly believe that imme- diately it is ratified jealousy and animosity will be engendered in Canada and in other portions of the **British** dominions.

* This agreement, which grants a preference to New Zealand against Other parts of the **British** Dominions and the rest of the world, must be read in conjunction with the motion relating to preferences to Great Britain, which is next to be dealt with.

* Like the honorable and learned member for Parkes, I have always been a strong Imperialist, and I share with him the view that we should have absolute freetrade within the **British** Empire,, and protection against the outside world.

* Britain at the present time is the Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain, and in the course of his preferential campaign he suggested that Australia and other portions of the **British** Dominions should practically cease the development of their manufacturing interests.

* Addressing the people of Great Britain he said, in effect, " If you agree to the free admission of the foodstuffs exported by your Colonies, and are prepared to tax those sent from other countries, the Colonies, in return, will stop the development of their manufacturing interests by removing their protective duties against **British** manufactures."

* I wish to emphasize the point that I am so strong a believer in the principle of preferential trade that, like the honorable and learned member for Parkes, I am prepared to support absolute free-trade within the **British** Empire, and protection against the outside world.

* Manchester Co-operative Wholesale Association, which specially encourages the development of industries within the **British** possessions.

* The article in the  Age  of this morning contains the following : - 
I should like to know what control the Comptroller-General can exercise over the **British** powder combine?

* Will the Minister undertake to force the **British** manufacturers to supply the local fuse factory with powder ?

* That compulsory service is quite unnecessary for the **British** race and that compulsion was unnecessary to obtain fighting material.

* **British** nation does in this matter.

* The fact that these lascars are **British** subjects, I admit, opens up a very big question, 1&gt;ut it is one which I am very certain that our fellow subjects in Great Britain would not for a moment view with equanimity if they were face to face with the same imminent danger that presents itself to us.

* His remarks on the lamentable and deplorable falling away of the element of the purely **British** seaman in the mercantile marine of Great Britain are worth noting.

* He says that- 
In the mercantile marine the number of **British** seamen is diminishing year lay year, and unless steps are taken to prevent it they will diminish still more rapidly  in  the future.

* I have here a table showing how the number of **British** seamen has diminished from the year 1891 to the year 1896, and I find that under no age from 15 to over 50 has.

* there been an increase in the number of **British** seamen, either per cent, or actual; whilst in nearly every one there has been a substantial decrease.

* I find that the whole of the **British** seamen rated as belonging to some **British** port- - -that is, born in the **British** Isles - number 115,824, and the **British** seamen not otherwise defined number 4,368.

* These figures show 55,000 foreigners, including lascars, out of a total of 180,000 **British** seamen.

* From the stand-point of the man of business, it does not matter whether a man is a Britisher, a Scandinavian, or a Iascar ; but in time of trouble it will be better for these men of business to have their marine manned by **British** seamen than that they should perhaps lose their avocation and their marine as well.

* The employment of **British** seamen is an insurance fund against nsk in time of danger.

* Now this matter of finding seamen for the mercantile marine is becoming so serious that in the  Naval  Annual  of 1891 it is pointed out that 50 years ago there were 200,000 **British** seamen in the mercantile marine, whereas to-day we have scarcely half that number ; that is a reduction of 50 per cent, in 50 years, and it is a very  serious  thing to contemplate.

* That agreement was entered into by every one of the States represented in conjunction with the **British** Postmaster-General.

* The clause reads as follows : - 
That was in reference to the reduction of rates which has recently been brought about by the agreement between the Eastern Extension Company, the **British** Government, and all the States, except the State of Victoria.

* I use the word " foreigners " merely as referring to a nationality which is not **British**, and nearly all the cables are owned by American firms.

* The business will largely be done on the Pacific line, which is called a State-owned line which, as against the other, is called "all **British**" or "all red," and which so much has been made of.

* So that there is not so much " all **British** " about it after all.

* The only thing that makes it " all **British** " is that it touches only on **British** territory, but of course the same argument could be used in favour of the Cape cable, which also touches only on **British** territory.

* Are there any **British** consuls or agents in German New Guinea, Samoa, the French Islands of the Pacific, New Caledonia, and the Dutch Netherlands ?

* According to the Customs Tariff Act, there is a duty of 15 per cent, on undressed -feathers, but the duty in the case of feathers from South Africa is only 10 per cent., whereas the Tariff now before us places both **British** and foreign feathers at 15 per cent.

* A remarkable declaration in respect to the future of the **British** Empire has been made in the course of a press interview at New York by Cardinal Michael Logue, Archbishop of Armagh and Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland.

* Cardinal Logue declared that he saw signs of the certain dissolution of the **British** Empire. "

* Is it not a fact that the ties of race and sentiment of the **British** race that most effectively bind the Empire together have never been stronger in Australia than they are to-day?

* No nation worthy of the name, and certainly no community of **British** people, should hesitate to provide for its own protection.

* For instance, they allow lascars space equal to  about double the size of an ordinary coffin, whereas the space which should be allowed, under the **British** law, is' 120 cubic feet.

* The Government had called attention to the fact that the space supplied to Iascar seamen was not the space provided for **British** seamen, and that the P. and O.

* Mr. Weir,  who, I believe, is also a Conservative member of the House of Commons, asked in the course of the debate whether there were any labour conditions in the contract, seeing that the company .received ^400,000 a year from the **British** Government.

* The report of  Mr. Weir's  speech contained the following - 
If there were not, there ought to be, as when the **British** flag flew over South Africa, he supposed the P. and D. would have at their disposal the labour of the Matabeles,  Bechuanas, Swazis,  and other native tribes, and these men would work for 4d.

* To give a preference to an alien over a **British** subject, to substitute Chinamen for white **British** workers, and to deny the latter opportunities for employment, is inimical to the best interests of the Empire.

* As an Imperial question, every part of the Empire is concerned in it, and Australia has a right to speak, and to continue to speak as she has commenced, in protest against this indignity to her people, for the benefit of capitalists who care nought except for the profit that they may make out of their enterprises, and of Chinese whose views are foreign to our hopes of **British** supremacy, and of **British** honour and glory.

* To prefer, for the sake of private greed, Chinese aliens to white **British** subjects meansthe loss of the realization of the hopes rightly entertained by the members of the Empire, that those who assisted the mother country, the people of Australia among them, would not be given practically the option to starve in South Africa, or hopeless of work, to leave the place where they should receive preferential consideration.

* Opportunity for employment is being taken from our own people and given to others, who have no claim upon the **British** Government as members of the Empire: it is being taken from **British** subjects and given to Chinamen, who own no allegiance to the Grown.

* As a guarantee for the- future peace of the land, settle it with loyal **British** subjects, with people to whom the Empire can look for support and defence in time of stress and trouble.

* Do you tell me that in such a state of things the Chinaman - introduced under circumstances which make him a slave or a serf in the land, since he is tied down to the confines of a certain block, to work there for a certain time, and restricted from going beyond a distance of, I think, a mile, afterwards to be sent home again - guarantees a loyal resident population ready to support the **British** flag should the occasion again arise?

* as was the .established policy of every 
The rates paid to **British** seamen differ a great deal.

* Numbers of Australians and numbers of other **British** subjects are in South Africa, desirous to obtain work and unable to find it.

* He has little chance now ; but his case is to be aggravated, and he is to be denied the opportunity to obtain work at a fair wage, in order to make way, not for **British** subjects, but for aliens- who have proved themselves to be undesirable residents in a country such as this, whose' customs generally are not likely to lead to the permanent development of **British** resources or to the security of **British** 'supremacy - men who own no allegiance to the **British** Crown, and who are neither by nature nor  disposi-.tion  able or willing to render it adequate support in time of need.

* It seems to me that as we have taken over **British** New Guinea we must be prepared to accept our full responsibility.

* I do not say that we ought not to retain our hold upon **British** New Guinea.

* I agree that the **British** Government acted rightly in taking over that portion of New Guinea which was .

* - But **British** New Guinea has been taken over by the 
Commonwealth, and, so far as the question of defence is concerned, it is just as much a part of Australia as is New South Wales, or Queensland.

* The States Legislatures have the sole right to deal with many of the matters on which we can legislate for **British** New.

* There was a time not so very long ago when so jealous was the feeling in the minds of the Imperial authorities as to their colonial possessions, that the last thing in the world a **British** Minister would have dreamt of proposing would have been any sort of partnership between the Imperial Government and the **British** dependencies, whether for military or naval purposes.

* A much happier phase has now come over the relations between the **British** Government and the other governing bodies in the Empire upon this and many other important questions, and we now find the Imperial authorities profoundly eager to draw us all into partnership, whilst on the part of the self-governing States of the Empire there is a profound disinclination to adopt that course.

* As we all know, about that time we had not only **British** ships on our coasts, but Imperial troops quartered in our towns.

* The **British** Government received with satisfaction the assurance that' the Australian Governments were prepared to develop their coastal defences, but they did not regard with the same feeling the request for the strengthening of the **British** Navy in these seas, maintained wholly at the cost of the Imperial Government.

* As time went on, Commodore Tryon, who was commissioned by the **British** Government to move the various Australian Governments, so far prevailed upon them that a conference was assembled in London in the year 1S87.

* The Admiralty authorized the representative of the **British** Government to propose certain vessels for the Auxiliary Squadron, and, further, it was suggested that the limits of employment of these vessels should be fixed.

* The Admiralty and the Imperial Government then had no objection to the limitation of the operations of the Auxiliary Squadron, because the object of that Squadron was not so much to add to the mobile strength of the **British** Navy as to perform a special service in one particular part of the **British** Empire.

* Whilst I intend to support the new agreement, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I altogether repudiate the attempt which is obviously being made to change the position and relationship of the Commonwealth to the **British** Government in matters of Imperial policy.

* I wish it to be understood that it is a thoroughly able minute, and I am in no sense disparaging the ability which is evident in its composition ; but I must take serious objection to the light in which it puts the Commonweal th before the **British** Government.

* If the Minister for Defence had been present at that Conference no  doubt  he would have taught the Admiralty authorities a large number of things in connexion with the management of the **British** Navy.

* My point is that it was placed upon the official records of the **British** Parliament as a .State document from the Commonwealth Government.

* If such a plan can be brought about, it would be necessary for the "**British** dominions beyond the Seas "- 
Imagine my right honorable friend taking his seat on the Admiralty Board, in order to assist to manage the **British** Navy as a representative of the Commonwealth of Australia.

* But it almost transcends one's power of intellectual digestion to comprehend the fate of the **British** Navy when submitted to this sort of control.

* It is another proof of the somewhat dissimilar views upon naval tactics which have been expressed by the Minister in charge of the Defence Department and the Prime Minister that, while the Prime Minister occupied much time and used a considerable number of quotations from Admiralty documents in order to give us a few elementary lessons which I suppose were obvious, pointing out that when a war is going on it is necessary to be vigorous and to have your ships at points where they will be able to do the greatest damage to the enemy, and protect most efficiently your own commerce - whilst he was at great pains to show that for such purposes we must have one brain to think and one arm to strike, the Minister for Defence considers that the **British** Navy cannot be efficiently managed even in times of war- 
Not necessarily I suppose, in my right honorable friend's view, so long as Australia was represented.

* But I wish to point out that this theory of a partnership with the **British** Government - of a share in the control of the **British** Admiralty - is a proposition to which, for the sake of the name of Australia, I should have liked my right honorable friend to have committed himself in his own State in the far west, rather than in the documents submitted to the Imperial Ministers and the people of the Empire.

* Whilst it is fashionable, in the language of  Mr. Chamberlain,  to represent the selfgoverning colonies as knocking at the door of Imperial power and asking for a share in the management of the Empire, I submit, with great respect to that most distinguished man, that that necessity, wherever else it may exist, is not to be found in this part of the **British** Empire.

* burden of the Empire in times of danger or of war, but because we have a sufficient amount of common sense to know that if we were to endeavour to manage the concerns of the **British** Empire as we would manage the concerns of this House, or this Government, the project would inevitably break down.

* When  people speak of the **British** Empire, do they forget that 34.0,000,000 of  His  Majesty's subjects, out of the total of 400,000,000, are to be found in one part of Asia - in India.

* Think what a marvellous concentration of mental and physical power exists upon that little spot of earth where those 41,000,000 of the **British** race live.

* Where would its centre of gravity be  1  Where would be the possibility of that clear, decisive, independent thought and action which alone can maintain the marvellous burdens of the great series of **British** possessions?

* When people speak of the **British** Empire and the fortunes of the **British** race, do they remember that only 50 or 60 years ago **British** statesmen looked upon the great self-governing colonies as powers to be dreaded and kept in subjection ?

* When  Mr. Chamberlain  speaks of sharing the control and management of the **British** Empire, I ask what share had .

* I may, perhaps, be allowed to show where the real seat of this terrible strain upon the **British** people is ; where the desperate urgency is for obtaining pecuniary offerings from the various members of the Empire.

* In 1886 the taxation of the **British** people had increased in about 30 years by 16,000,000- -from 60,000,000 per annum to 76,000,000 per annum ; and in 1896 the increase was proceeding at very much the same rate.

* But it seems to me a new sort of **British** statesmanship which takes such infinite pains, when the expenditure of Great Britain upon defence is 70,000,000 a year, to obtain an increase from 100,000 to 200,000 in the contribution from Australia.

* My right honorable friend, the Prime Minister, is an Imperial statesman, and he is carried away by the rhetorical aspect of the achievements of the **British** race, but there are words used here by  His Excellency  Governor Clarke which, I think, are worthy of attention.

* If that be true as applied to the people inhabiting the **British** Islands, surely- it is equally true of the Anglo-Saxon race inhabiting this vast island in the southern seas.

* His Excellency  quotes the observation of Voltaire with reference to the continued success of the **British** Navy in all its engagements against all the Great Powers of the world.

* Only inherited instincts of the sea developed and intensified by  necessity,  constantly enforced upon the **British** people during many centuries, could have enabled us to win our Empire.

* We have the same instinct which has urged the people of the old country to ' expand upon the seas in time of war and ,in times of peace, and it is this capacity for expansion and triumph on the seas at all times that has not only made the Empire what it is, but has made the **British** people what they are as a great commercial nation.

* One of the best features about these ships to my mind is the fact that three of them are to be drill-ships ; but, drill-ships for what 1 - for the **British** Navy  1  The **British** Navy can be very well left to look after its own drill ships, and those belonging to the Australian squadron should be available for the training of Australian sailors for our own Naval Reserves.

* I do not object - I have never objected - to the **British** Navy recruiting here in Australia.

* Any Australian who enters the ranks of the **British** Navy takes a step which I have po word to say against.

* Therefore, I strongly support those who would give our naval brigades more prominence than they have had in the past, and I shall also strongly advocate the use of the war-ships for drilling them, as well as the reserve men of the **British** Navy.

* In view of what hag been said as to the German Navy and the immense advances it has made, honorable members will scarcely be prepared foi' the figures which I propose to read as to the relative strengths of the **British** and Germany navies, in regard not only to the  shipsin existencebutto  those which are building.

* No man has a clearer view or a. greater appreciation than I have of the immense responsibilities devolving upon those who govern the **British** Empire.

* But I think that one of the grandest characteristics of the **British** race, which has been faithfully maintained without ruin to the Empire, without destruction to the State, in the dark da)'s of the past, has been this conviction: that the 'truest strength of a. country consists, not so much in the amount of its expenditure, as in the prudence and economy with which its affairs are controlled.

* If it had been put to them at that time that there was not to be an Auxiliary Squadron combined with a purely **British** Squadron; that the **British** fleet was to be removed ; that instead of having two squadrons we should have only one, and that the limits of the station were to be enlarged - I was a Member of Parliament at the time - and from my knowledge of political feeling at that day, I say that I have no doubt whatever that such a proposal would have been scouted.

* We must admit that, since then, marvellous developments have taken place in other countrieswhich have necessitated the **British** Empire embarking upon a much larger expenditure.

* I wish it to be understood, by the vote which I shall give on this occasion, that whilst I hope I shall always play the part of a loyal subject, I shall never show the slightest countenance to any project which aims at altering the relations which this Commonwealth now has in the scheme of the **British** Empire.

* arrangement to which the States, the **British** Government, and the Orient and Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Companies were parties.

* The honor able member for Kennedy last night showed what extraordinary changes have taken place of late years in the character of the **British** mercantile marine.

* He said that, while in 1.860 the foreigners employed on **British** ships were 9 per cent, of the total, in 1900 they numbered 47 per cent.

* Even the honorable member for Mernda cannot dispute the statement that, if 40 per cent, of those employed on **British** ships are foreigners, it means that nearly half the total number of men there employed are foreigners.

* It seems to me that any one who takes that view must be entirely out of sympathy with the object that we have in view, namely, to increase the number of white **British** subjects employed in our mercantile marine.

* I would infinitely prefer to see Danes, Germans, or Swedes, rather than lascars, employed upon **British** ships.

* According to the return handed to me by the honorable member for Kennedy, there were, in i860, 334 lascars employed on **British** ships, whereas in 1900 the number had increased to 36,000.

* At present, we are at peace with all the great powers, and I should prefer to see white foreigners rather than black **British** subjects on our ships.

* I have not the slightest doubt that the people had made up their minds that the action of the Government was undesirable, both from the standpoint of those who wish the **British** troops well, and of those who, for some reason or other, extend their sympathy to the Boers.

* It would appear from the revelations made in  His,  Excellency's speech, and by the  admissions of the Prime Minister, that at the very time the right honorable gentleman pledged his word to the House that no action would be taken as to the despatch of troops, he knew that negotiations were then going on, and that the decision depended not on  any  action of his, or on  any determination of the House, ' but merely on the expressed desire of the **British** Government for such despatch.

* Though I do not deny that, technically, Ministers are responsible for the acts of the Crown or its representative, we stand in a different relation to the representative of the Crown than does the **British** Crown to the Cabinet itself.

* Whilst I am somewhat surprised that a motion of this kind should have been' brought forward by the Labour Party, who would no doubt most bitterly resent a protest from any other portion of the **British** Empire upon such a subject, for instance, as the Navigation Bill, I think that it is very much to their credit that they have submitted the motion.

* Such arguments are always used by **British** Governors of his class when they are called upon to deal with similar difficulties.

* I believe that the future of - that portion of the Empire depends upon the introduction of a large **British** population, which will, like a sponge, ultimately absorb the Dutch element.

* He is a Britisher who was born in England, and believes in the **British** Empire.

* It is because he has faith in the **British** Empire that he wishes to lay the foundation of its Federation under its own flag.

* honorable members sitting on the Opposition benches and in the Opposition corner, have not yet risen out of their swaddling-clothes to understand the greatness of the **British** Empire.

* Do honorable members opposite believe in the **British** Empire?

* If that is so; does any honorable member believe that blackfellows manning **British** ships will lick the white Europeans that  will man the ships of that great nation when the crash comes?

* If we take 485,000 from 2,064,000, we have 1,579,000, which this Commonwealth could save by adopting the poundage system, and with which we could start to build our own steamships, and so to push on the federation of the **British** Empire.

* I desire that years after we are dead and buried people shall be able to say, " The Federal Parliament of Australia, at such and such atime, established the **British** Empire Steam-ship Company.

* He referred to the white men who are engaged in the stoke-holes of the mail steamers and other vessels as the " scum " of the **British** race.

* Every one who is acquainted with .the history of the **British** mercantile marine knows that whenever danger has arisen, the so-called " scum " have died the death of men in order to save their fellow creatures.

* We who have read of the danger and travail which **British** seamen have been called upon to face - who appreciate their heroic conduct under all sorts of terrible circumstances - can feel a pride in them when we contrast their attitude with that of black crews such as that on the  Argus  the other day.

* From the Imperial point of view of securing a reserve for the **British** Navy in time of emergency, and also to secure the safety of those who " go down to the sea in ships," it is desirable that we should make this change.

* These gentlemen - mostly foreign Consuls living in our midst - are not only practically acquainted with the decimal systems of currency which prevail in their own countries, but as merchants here have an intimate knowledge of the **British** system,  and  they have unanimously expressed the opinion that the Commonwealth should adopt the decimal system as the best on economic grounds, and as a forward movement in  every  respect.

* Mr. Orlando  Baker, the Consul for the United States, who resides in Sydney, concluded his evidence by saying - 
The Government of the Commonwealth could make  a  trial in this direction, and if the experiment succeeds, which appears probable, it would open the way to the reform of the **British** monetary system, which is desired in the general interests of international commerce.

* When we looked further into the matter, however, we found that, in view of the position of the **British** sovereign, the wide-world respect which it has won, its great history and traditions, there would inevitably be a strong resistance to its abolition here, and that the adoption of any other unit would greatly diminish the chance of getting a decimal system adopted in Great Britain.

* A further argument in favour of the decimalization of the sovereign is to be found in the fact that quite recently the Peruvian Government adopted the **British** sovereign as the basis of their new coinage.

* First of all, we have the world-wide integrity of the **British** sovereign, and the world-wide knowledge and appreciation of it.

* It has been said that people far away in the East, in China and India, and in Egypt, put away sovereigns or hide them in the earth for years ; and whatever may happen to disturb the values of currencies, the **British** sovereign is always worth its weight in gold.

* In the second place, the tenth part of the **British** sovereign is the most convenient, as the largest silver coin of account or currency, and when it is further decimalized by tenths and hundredths it furnishes coins which will answer all reasonable requirements.

* In 1889 the **British** Government found its gold- coinage in much the same condition as that of Australia at the present time, and it was then estimated that it would cost 650,000 to restore it to a satisfactory condition.

* In the first instance, the report of the Committee recommends that we should take advantage of the facilities offered to Canada and other **British** possessions to obtain their currency coins either at the Royal Mint or at one of the Birmingham institutions under the charge of the Royal Mint.

* Prom the first the **British** Government recognised-as an honest **British** Government always will do - that it had no claim to the seigniorage which was made on the quantity of silver currency used in the Australian States.

* When the subject was considered in America,  Mr. Dunning,  a gentleman who seems to know a good deal about the subject of coinage, suggested that the difference between the Prench 25-franc piece and the **British** sovereign, amounting exactly to 88-hun- dredths, should be met by the reduction of the English sovereign by44hundredths, and the increase of the French 25-franc piece by 44-hundredths, bringing each to the same value.

* I believe that he also suggested that the **British** sovereign might be changed to only half the extent indicated, and that the other half might be retained as seigniorage, such as is claimed in respect to the Prench 25- franc piece, but not in connexion with the **British** sovereign.

* I believe that on the sea the magnificent efficiency of the **British** Fleets guarantees us as far as any human prevision can, and it is no service to the Empire to duplicate defence at points where duplication is unnecessary.

* I look to the training of the **British** Navy as good enough for us for many years ahead.

* My policy is that in the **British** fleet, with its preponderance over practically all the fleets of the world - for I have shown that in cruisers it beats Japan, Italy, Germany, and France together - the present power of Great Britain for our defence is large enough for the next ten years, supplemented by our present forces enlarged and improved.

* We hear of " little Englanders," but there are men whom I call "little Australians" - men who will not, for the benefit of all the people in Australia, obtain the services, as instructors, of veteran soldiers, officers, and non-commissioned officers of the **British** Army.

* I am speaking in the light of the actual fact, that there are now thousands of officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, in the **British** Army, who have gone through one of the biggest wars of the last thirty years.

* The Labour Party have decided to send a representative to Europe to attend the International Labour Con gress next year, so that the aspirations of the unions here may be brought into accord with those of the **British** and European organizations, which are in the direction I have indicated.

* When the Philippines were taken over by the United States of America, a promise was made that in accordance with an arrangement which the Spanish Government had previously carried out, the best favoured nation treatment should be extended to the **British** Government.

* We expended our money and the life's blood of many of our citizens in helping the **British** Government to conquer the Transvaal and Orange Free State ; but with a desire to increase their dividends the mine-owners there are carrying on an agitation which is steadily growing - and which will be successful unless we as a Parliament make some protest against it - for the introduction of some' 380,000 Hindoo and Chinese labourers.

* Under the new administration, natives in **British** South Africa, as well as in Portuguese territory who are able to live without working for white men, are being compelled to pay a hut tax of 1 or 2 per head, that impost being levied in order to force them to work in the mines.

* If this is a question which does not affect us, how is it that when the Prime Minister was attending the recent Imperial Conference, he did not hesitate to ask that legal practitioners in Australia should have a right to practice in the newly conquered **British** territory in South Africa ?

* It seems to me that we ought to do what we can to support the cause of the white races in **British** South Africa.

* We gain 10,000 per annum under an arrangement with the **British** Government, whereby we pay , 15,000 to that Government and they pay 25,000 to us, because we do not send so many letters home as they send out here.

* **British** shipping ring militates against competition.

* and the honorable member for West Sydneytake the view that this provision, which wasinserted on the motion of the honorablemember for Boothby, will not apply to Asiatics who are not **British** subjects.

* I point out the desirability of including, when all the conditions have been fulfilled, Asiatics who may he in our midst, who are subjects of the **British** Empire, and are regarded as citizens.

* By the Bill, as we have passed it,, we include natives of countries - some of whom are in a low scale of civilization - who have been admitted within our borders, and, though they have been here the requisite time, may have never been naturalized, or undertaken responsibility as **British** subjects until pensions were offering.

* We admit many men - some of whom, it may be, are as objectionable as, or even more objectionable than, these Asiatic **British** subjects - to the right to claim pensions, and we have no bar to their admission to Australia.

* an Asiatic, though a **British** subject, cannot enter the Commonwealth.

* Theadoption of such provision will do away with the charge that in this respect we not only fail to recognise citizenship of the Empire, but are really unjust in our treatment of **British** subjects, as compared with aliens to whom we are willing to give pensions.

* I would suggest that the Senate's amendment be disagreed with, and that the words, " except those born in Australia," be left out, and the words, " except natural-born **British** subjects," be inserted in lieu thereof.

* The words I have suggested appear in the Naturalization Act, and natives of India are, I take it, **British** subjects.

* I have an idea that the New South Wales Act allowed pensions to be received by **British** subjects.

* I merely foreshadow this amendment- 
I have only to add that the view taken is that fifty years hence the predominance of the **British** flag in distant seas is n5t conceivable unless, not only Australia, but the whole self-governing countries of the Empire begin at once to lay the foundations of their future navies.

* The Prime Minister values this vote not only as one which will tend to augment locally the sea power of the Empire, but as a lead or example offered to every **British** settlement in all parts of the world, just in the same way as Australia has given a lead in the direction of gradually training the whole population of the country for defence purposes.

* With regard to naval matters I am not now concerned so much with the question of control, but rather with the fact that the proposal before us will mean augmenting the **British** power afloat.

* I admit to honorable members, who may differ from the Government in this matter, that there may be graver things to occupy the **British** Fleet during war than protecting the Australian ports and trade.

* Let us suppose the **British** Fleet to be temporarily required for greater work than defending the floating trade of Australia.

* What do we find in regard to the docile Indian - the **British** subject - about whom some honorable members were screaming just now ?

* We know very well that a number of these so-called **British** subjects who come to Queensland can both talk and write English exceedingly well, and a Bill such as that now framed will not keep them out of Australia.

* Under these circumstances, I feel that it would have been better to have obtained the services of a **British** colonel who had risen from the ranks.

* The **British** trusts are largely held together by what are termed " gentlemen's agreements," of which there is no documentary evidence, nothing being put on paper ; and those who have gone carefully  into  the operations of trusts say that some  of  the most pernicious effects of combination are due to these arrangements, which the law cannot get at.

* I have just read a most interesting book,  The Trust Movement in **British** Industry,  by H. W. Macrosty, which cannot be said to be antagonistic to or insupport of trusts.

* In his survey and conclusions the writer says - 
In other words, the most that the writer can say of the movement is that the proportion of **British** trade not controlled by combinations is greater than is that under their direction.

* As the leader of the Opposition has pointed out, legislation of this kind appears to involve the subversion of all the best-known maxims of **British** jurisprudence.

* The honorable member will find in the book much that is a very serious reflection on some of the business methods adopted by **British** combines.

* It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that in regard to two important matters in connexion with the Papua (**British** New Guinea) Bill, the opinion of this House has been flouted.

* If we encouraged **British** capitalists to take up this work, how should we be able to interfere, and to destroy their chance of securing what they deemed a reasonable return for their investment ?

* This bounty, if given to private individuals, will really benefit **British** capitalists.

* The bonus, if paid to private individuals, would go, in the first instance, to help two parties to successfully float a loan on the London market, and at least onefourth of it would be paid to the **British** money lender, who has already done well out of Australia, because he has had from us more money than we have ever borrowed from him, while we are as much in debt as ever.

* t do not believe in taking money from the poor taxpayers, and giving it to "**British** capitalists.

* That after the words " On dutiable goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom," in the heading to the fourth column, the words " by white **British** workmen " be inserted, and that after the words " and imported direct in **British** ships" the words "manned exclusively by white **British** seamen " be added.

* It is designed to grant preference to white **British** workmen as against other white competitors.

* If it be reasonable to grant a preference to **British** workmen employed on shore, it is equally rea.sonable to extend that preference to **British** workers on vessels carrying these goods to Australia.

* I nave already presented figures showing that nearly onehalf of the men  employed  in the mercantile marine of Great Britain to-day are foreigners, or coloured **British** subjects.

* I should not have submitted it in its present form but for the fact that the Government propose to protect **British** workers against other white workers, and that I think that, if the Government proposal be adopted, we should provide that the protection shall apply exclusively to white **British** workers.

* The Attorney-General has done no more than reply to the statements made by the honorable member for Werriwa and others, as to the accepted practice of the **British** Parliament.

* No; the **British** representatives agreed to certain resolutions which, I believe, have been published, and we now have the power to deal not only with the Australian ships and Australian seamen, but also with oversea ships and seamen if they trade on the coast.

* Altogether, I think it must be acknowledged that the **British** Government have dealt very fairly by us, and in most cases the ship-owners were more moderate than I had anticipated.

* We import an immense quantity of foreign manufactures, and not so much **British** manufactures as we ought to; and preferential trade would benefit the old country.

* in any way to weaker the loyalty which prevails throughout the Empire "Nothing that was said by either the Prime Minister or myself at that Conference could be construed into our interfering in **British** party politics.

* The number of **British** subjects resident in the New Hebrides.

* The total area of land held in 1903 and 1904 by **British** subjects, and the conditions upon which such land was held.

* The Admiralty report, 1903, gives the number of **British** inhabitants as 214; French, 255.

* The above table includes importations which have been transhipped to other States and to oversea countries, and, although it includes produce grown by foreign settlers, the figures could be taken as a fair approximation of the value of the surplus products grown by **British** residents for export, as French vessels also.

* carry produce of **British** subjects to New Caledonia, which would about equalize matters.

* The **British** Resident in the Group has been asked to furnish particulars, if obtainable.

* The **British** practice has been altered from time to tune, generally in the direction of enlarged concessions to the shipping trade, but  Mr. Powell  may fairly be regarded as being familiar with the condition of the law at the time of which he wrote.

* It has long been the policy to permit the storing free of duty of articles, otherwise dutiable, on board vessels going to foreign parts, and to give certain facilities for similar consumption in **British** waters of stores on vessels arriving from ports beyond the seas.

* Subject to certain allowances - to be mentioned - all such stores are, while the vessel is in **British** waters, locked up and sealed on board, or, if further foreign voyage is not soon contemplated, are removed to a Queen's warehouse, and kept in charge until required by the owners for further use.

* He then points out that various exceptions have been made in regard to thesupply of stores, and he ultimately declares the full **British** position at the time he wrote to be as follows :  - 
It has, however, been long held, first as to foreign vessels, and ultimately as to **British** vessels, that these beginnings and ends of foreign voyages, provided they genuinely are such, shall, for the purposes of stores, be considered part of the foreign voyage, and stores be allowed accordingly.

* The suggestion was not only very properly rejected by the **British** Government, but it did not even receive consideration, because it was immediately opposed by men like  Sir Wilfrid  Laurier, and, I think, the Prime Minister of the Cape.

* This is the greatest organ of English opinion, taken as a whole, and it is the representative of **British** national relations.

* And this is what this out-and-out preference paper said - 
We have selected as far as possible the portions of the Turill which deal with commodities in which **British** commerce is most  largely  interested, and from which the effect upon* this country of the chances which it has introduced can be most readily estimated, ft will be found that the tendency of the whole Tariff is in the direction of .largely increased protection; and, although, in a considerable number of cases, the duties levied on **British** goods will be somewhat less than those upon goods tff the same description arriving from other countries, the general effect of the whole is in a direction which must be detrimental to our trade.

* Surely, if we desire to manifest in a substantial and national way, from an Australian point of view, onn attachment - which has never been questioned or impugned, and which has been attested in the South African  war and on many other occasions - a better way would be to increase our contribution to the Navy that defends, not only the trade in which weare interested with Great Britain, but the trade of **British** Possessions, amounting to something like  300,000,000,  which never touches the United Kingdom at all.

* But what would be the whole scope of the preference, as against the rest of the world, including the remaining units of the **British** Empire?

* I recognise that, in testing the exports of wheat, one can only take averages ; but, whilst I am giving the exports of a particular year, they are not very far from being typical of the proportions of food products sent from the various parts of the world to the **British** Empire.

* These figures alone show the futility of any attempt to induce the 
Mother Country, by this implied solicitation, to revert to a system akin to the corn laws, which proved so disastrous to the **British** people.

* Is there any scope for preference in respect of the raw materials used in **British** manufactures ?

* Trade between France and its colonies is encouraged by a preference; but the result is that, whilst the external trade of the **British** Possessions since the abandonment of that policy has increased to about  500,000,000,  the external trade of the French colonies and possessions is only about  61,000,000.

* If we take the relative importance of the trade of the United Kingdom  with Australia and New Zealand and all other countries, we find that the annual average of the export of **British** produce to Australia and New Zealand from  1904  to1906 was  24,896,000,  whilst to the other Colonies and Posses- sions which are left out of these prefer- ential proposals that we now offer, it was ^90,650,000.

* In the matter of defence, the **British** Navy is practical I  our sole protection.

* The exports of **British** products and manufactures are of the annual' value of 7 os.

* If the Minister proposed a substantial preference that would enable the **British** manufacturers of apparel, piece goods, or machinery - and these items represent about 22,000,000 worth of the total trade of Australia - the power behind him would at once crumble into dust.

* It is not to be forgotten that this proposal, which we are told is one to establish Empire unity - is aimed just as directly at the rest of the **British** Empire as it is at foreign countries.

* This is a proposal to discriminate against every other **British** possession.

* It is a proposition to give a preference to only the mother country, without regard to !any other part of the **British** Empire, which covers an area of about 12,000,000 square miles.

* But there are, of course, two parties to a bargain, and as long as the **British** people find that the price they have to pay for this system is too great we cannot hope to establish that reciprocal arrangement' without which the scheme would be worth very little.

* It is impossible, from a protectionist point of view, to open the doors of Australia to the **British** manufacturers.

* There will be ample room for an increase of **British** imports under the preferential arrangement proposed.

* What scope is there under these miserable proposals for the increase of **British** imports?

* imported, 201,185 lbs came from the United Kingdom, so that the proposed duty will be really operative, almost wholly, against the **British** product.

* were imported, and these were nearly all of **British** manufacture.

* In addition to that, we have definitely taken up a position which exposes us more than any other part of the **British** Empire to the risk of offence at the hands of other nations.

* Unfortunately, it is fifty years since **British** and American warships enforced at the cannon's mouth the demand that white men should be allowed to land and trade in Japan.

* Therefore, what we have to meet is the possibility of coastal attack, and we have to consider to what extent the **British** Navy might fail us in the time of danger.

* When the House adjourned for lunch I was dealing with the necessity of Australian defence without absolute dependence on the **British** Navy.

* I have to remember that since the acceptance of the Naval Agreement, the **British** Navy has been called upon to perform duties, and to face risks and dangers, which, at that time, may have been in con- templation, but were not imminent, as they now appear to be.

* So much is that the case, that one" writer, Admiral Bowden Smith, who was in command of the Australian Squadron some years ago, and whose name is respected in Australia, said, as recently as 7th August last, in &amp; letter to the  Times: - 
That is the **British** Navy - have spoken of the command of the seas we have meant what the term implies.

* When I find men like Blatchford, Quelch, and Hyndman, who have always been for peace, and opposed to every form of militarism, asserting that the German menace actually exists, and must be faced without delay, I can appreciate the position of those **British** publicists who are of opinion that the **British** Fleet should be disposed almost entirely round the heart of the Empire.

* When  Sir Edmund  Barton, as Prime Minister, was trying to induce Parliament to accept the Naval Agreement, he contended that we did not require to keep the **British** Squadron around our coasts - that our duty was to seek for the enemy wherever he was to be found - and he read long extracts from  Malian,  and others of the "blue-water school," who urge that it is better for us to carry the attack into the enemy's waters.

* There is no doubt that the Pacific has been largely deserted by the **British** Navy, and that since the **British**- Japanese treaty the Pacific Ocean has been left, to a certain extent, to Japan.

* As a consequence, we have to see to it that any preparations we make are largely based on the view that there is a possibility, first, of no **British** fleet being here to defend us, and, secondly, of the defeat of that fleet.

* What would happen if the **British** Navy, on which the right honorable member seems to plank the whole of his confidence, and the whole of his opposition to the Government scheme, were to be defeated or were to desert the Pacific, as it deserted the West Indies, which formed the principal Colony at the time of the Napoleonic wars'!

* If we depend on the **British** Navy, which may or may not be.

* We have been told that the **British** Empire, in spite of its enemies and its splendid isolation, has been able to hold its own without compulsory military training.

* Are not those who join the **British** Army virtually compelled to do so?

* I have nothing to say against the **British** soldier.

* Would-be recruits, whom we in Australia would not accept, are wel.comed by the **British** Army authorities.

* Consequently, the **British** Army gets, not the flower of the country, as Continental armies do, but men of comparatively poor physique.

* This is emphasized by the fact that, while in the Franco-German war only 29 per cent, of the casualties resulted from enteric fever and other illness, in the South African war, 56 per cent, of the **British** losses was due to those causes.

* As for accounting for the difference by differences in sanitation, let me point out, first, that the **British** Army ideals of sanitation and cleanliness, and all the details of camp life, are not excelled by those of any other army.

* The use of parliamentary powers under any other conditions is altogether foreign to the history of **British** Parliaments.

* If a crisis occurred to-morrow in any **British** Parliament, the Government would go to the country with those who had supported them ; but in this case, we are face to face with the extraordinary position that there is no possible prospect of the gentlemen who sit on the Treasury benches going to the country in alliance with those who keep them in power.

* I am pointing out to the honorable member that if the duties are not increased against the great **British** iron exporters, tariff revision will bring no relief.

* We want to extend a preference only to **British** manufacturers.

* For the first time in the history of this Parliament, when a resolution imposing Customs duties has been tabled, we are going to refrain from collecting those duties in respect of **British** goods which are now in **British** bottoms or in bond.

* We merely propose to place all **British** goods upon one footing, and all foreign goods upon another.

* To my mind, it would be most unfair to penalize **British** goods, or to compel **British** ships to carry only Britishers.

* I believe this is the introduction of a principle, which, so far as I have read, has never been acted upon in any **British** Parliament.

* <para class="block" pgwide="yes">
 Papua (**British** [23 November, 1904.]

* Some time ago the Honorable A. Musgrave, who knows as much about the conditions which obtain in **British** New Guinea as does any man in the world, visited Australia, and I had an opportunity of conversing with him upon this subject.

* I particularly inquired of him whether the native population of **British** New Guinea were obtaining intoxicating liquor, and, if so, what effect it was having upon them.

* I do not intend to argue what becomes of the large quantity of liquor which is imported into **British** New Guinea.

* I think we should eliminate at least three-fourths of the evils that are said to exist in connexion with the sale of liquor in **British** New Guinea, by adopting that course.

* Scarcely one of them raises his voice in defence of the proposal made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, to impose prohibition upon the people of **British** New Guinea against their will.

* Except in **British** New Guinea and in the Federal Territory.

* W. E. Bromilow, who has been quoted more than once, and who is chairman of the Methodist Mission of **British** New Guinea, and has had thirteen years' experience in the Territory, says - 
We have a right to give consideration to the opinions of those who have lived in the Possession from ten to fifteen years.

* The Eureka Stockade outbreak was clue to a feeling on the part of the miners that they were being unjustly dealt with, and while I do not imagine that the miners of **British** New Guinea would go to the same lengths, I believe that if they felt that they were being unjustly treated, they might do that which would not be wholly to the advantage of the natives, or the Territory.

* The words, "**British** coins," are used apparently on the assumption that the words "United Kingdom" used in the definition clause mean as defined in the Acts Interpretation Act "Great Britain and Ireland," and that the currency must be confined to Australian coins or coins in currency in Great Britain and Ireland.

* I think that the "**British** coins" referred to in sub-clause 1 are coins which would be legal tender in England, or, if sent out here, would be legal tender in the Commonwealth.

* By the 91st section of the **British** North American Act, the Dominion of Canada is given power to raise revenue, either by direct or indirect taxation, and it has raised revenue by direct taxation.

* The manufacturers, finding themselves pressed by foreign competition, are reducing the wages of their employes as low as they can, and when they can no longer reduce them, they are sending their machinery to the East in order to obtain the cheaply paid labour of those countries for the manufacture of goods which go back to England, and are then sent out here and all over the world as **British** goods.

* No fewer than 33 of the men rejected were white men, and I am sorry to say "that three or four of them were **British**.

* I told honorable members that I saw no reason why, in order to provide for the continuance of the sugar industry, an arrangement should not be made with the **British** authorities in India for bringing a certain number of Hindoos or other men of Indian race here under agreement to work in the fields, to be sent back when their term of service had expired.

* It was sought to refuse admission to men belonging to the **British** race who were in every respect desirable immigrants.

* The men I allude to were not allowed to land as **British** subjects ought to have been allowed to land in what is practically a **British** country.

* I have always held that, Australia being an island continent, a fleet is a form of insurance to us, so that we could not do better than, so to speak, subsidize the **British** authorities, if they require a subsidy, to provide for our defence.

* I do not know if the writer is a man I knew in former years, but I ask the Minister of External Affairs to see whether any one of **British** blood has been unfairly treated.

* The English Parliament has passed laws which require the **British** railway companies to reduce rates and freights when their dividends rise to a certain point.

* It is most inconsistent for the honorable member for Gippsland to say that he will bar **British** goods, and yet raise an outcry because a few words of inquiry are addressed to a number of Britishers who desire to land here apparently in contravention of the law.

* If such a thing is possible in the English Channel, how much more likely is it to occur in the broad waters which surround Australia % It seems to me that we cannot rely upon any one fleet, whether locally-owned or under the control of the **British** Admiralty, to safeguard us from sudden piratical attacks by a foreign navy.

* If we take our share of the responsibility in the defence of the Empire by providing for the , safety of this portionof it, we shall still have the protection of the **British** navy for our commerce in other parts of the world, if not in these waters.

* I ask the honorable member if he has read the report on the subject of child labour which was recently presented to the **British** Parliament ?

* Surely, if it is defective loyalty to place duties upon goods imported from England, it is defective loyalty to prevent **British** subjects from entering Australia.

* The Hindoo is a **British** subject, and, if my honorable friend carried out his argument to a logical conclusion, he ought, in loyalty to England, and to the Emperor of India, to allow the Hindoos to come here in hordes to compete with our own people in the sugar and wheat-fields of the continent.

* I should like to explain, in regard to the statement about the wages of compositors in foreign printing works, that a number of **British** printers, in order to take advantage of the cheap labour of Japan, have set up establishments in Japan, and are there printing illuminated scriptural texts and Bibles, and sending them to England for sale.

* The honorable member for Darwin spoke the other day of the decadence of the **British** race, but he has now gone to the other extreme.

* I think that the sooner this Parliament comes to an understanding with the **British** Government as to the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution Act, whether it be in relation to the immigration of people to these shores, or to the carrying out of the necessary services of the Commonwealth, the better it will be for the future conduct of the affairs of Australia.

* I dare say that no honorable member is more fully acquainted than he is with the conditions prevailing on board the **British** merchantmen which come to these States.

* They do not .employ so large a proportion of Britishers as I would like to see, in view of the preservation of the **British** mercantile marine, but they do without the assistance of coloured labour.

* references to slavery under the **British** flag in Western Australia.

* If we go back to the first law passed in 1841, when  Mr. John  Hutt was Governor, we see that the preamble declares that **British** law is inapplicable to aboriginals, since they are ignorant of any future state of rewards and punishments.

* The men who go to **British** New Guinea take their lives in their hands, and I do not think that it is right to deprive them of the opportunity to take a drop of whisky if they think it will do them good.

* The honorable member desired to point out that certain products sent to England from Australia had a prejudicial effect on the **British** producer, in driving him out of his own home market.

* We realize that Australia and other parts of the Empire have done a great deal in supplying the wants of **British** consumers in this particular article.

* On consulting the last return presented to both Houses of Parliament in the old country, I find that the quantity of butter sent from the **British** Possessions as a whole - I am dealing not only with Australian butter, because I take it that the matter really affects the whole of the Possessions of the mother country, and that it has a direct bearing on the ratio of the amount sent from European countries - was in 1901 631,985 cwt.

* In 1902- the quantity sent from **British** Possessions was 525,035 cwt, and from foreign countries 3,449,898 cwt.

* In 1903 the quantity sent from **British** Possessions was 557,828^ cwt., and from foreign countries 3,502,866.

* In  1904  the importations of butter from **British** Possessions ran up to  1,045,758  cwt., and from foreign countries the imports fell to  3,195,207  cwt.

* There was an increase of imports from **British** Possessions, and a relative decrease of imports from foreign countries.

* In  1905  the imports from **British** Possessions totalled  1,054,209  cwt., and there was almost a relative diminution from foreign countries -  31093,657  cwt.

* It was not the **British** producer who was affected by this particular product being sent from Australia and other **British** Possessions to England, but the foreign producer - -that foreign producer for whom., I am rather sorry to say, my honorable friends opposite seem to be solicitous on all occasions.

* We guarantee to fortify our own cities, and our coal depots, which are essential to the efficient working of the **British** Navy, so that the argument of the honorable member for Bland has not much weight.

* If the **British** fleet were to hand over the patrol of the South Seas to an Australian Navy, it would inevitably lead to friction and misunderstanding with, at any rate, two ofthe great Powers of the world.

* It is not a nation ; it is simply a collection of States, formed into a Commonwealth under the shadow of the **British** Crown.

* Further, I insist that the creation and control of a navy is not in keeping with our position as a Commonwealth under the **British** Crown.

* In view of all that has been said about the **British** Navy, and the miserable contribution that we are asked to make towards the maintenance of this fleet, I think we should remember that this Parliament has passed a measure providing for a white Australia, and that we should ask ourselves - " What would be the possibility of a white Australia if it were not for the power of the **British** Navy behind it?"

* Japan may not always be the ally of Great Britain; she is not likely to be the ally of an independent Australia, and I venture to say that but for the **British** Navy that power would not only be in a position to levy tribute upon our great cities, but to occupy the greater part of Northern Aus-, tralia.

* In the speeches which have been delivered by other honorable members of the party, great stress has been laid upon the contention that we are able to defend ourselves, and that we do not require the protection of the **British** Navy.

* Both the honorable member for Kennedy and the honorable member for South Australia,  Mr. Batchelor,,  argued that we did not require **British** assistance ; that we were capable of protecting ourselves.

* In the speech which he delivered last session during the second-reading debate on the Defence Bill, he said - 
I am quite prepared to admit that, as far as outside defence, and the protection of our commerce is concerned, we ought to be prepared to make some contribution towards the maintenance of something like an efficient **British** fleet.

* We should strongly object if the **British** Parliament were to send us a message expressing the hope that we would not pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.

* When the Director of the **British** Embassy,  Colonel McCartney,  went to China, he had to be particularly careful that he and his staff did not sit on chairs lower than that provided for the Emperor himself.

* The staff had to carry with them a pocket rule with which to measure their seats, and as an assertion of **British** authority, care was taken that none of the members of the Embassy used a chair lower than that occupied by the Emperor.

* There are pages and pages of these regulations, and the list is only kept within nine or ten pages by such condensations as, for example - 
If it does not, I think it will be injurious to our interests to take control of the **British** possession there.

* upon the importation of **British** and foreign machinery into Western Australia would produce 1,787 8s.

* The consecration is a religious ceremony, which is invariably followed in  the  **British** Army, and is provided for in the King's Regulations.

* The King's Regulations provide a form of prayer, which is to be read in connexion with the presentation of colours of any kind to a regiment, and I see no reason for not following the practice of the **British** Army on a similar occasion in Australia.

* The Prime Minister has made the statement that only in one other part of the **British** Empire has legislation of this character been carried into effect.

* At the third annual meeting of the general Council of the Chambers of Commerce of the Commonwealth, held in Melbourne in April last, the following resolution was passed : - 
It is common knowledge that for years past in all parts of the **British** Empire there, has been great conflict between shippers and ship-owners.

* The Prime Minister of Great Britain declared, just before our Prime Minister set out upon his crusade, that under the most favorable circumstances the **British** House of Commons could not consider the question for at least two years to come.

* Here we have the declaration of men at least as great as  Mr. Chamberlain,,  and with at least as great a knowledge of finance and commerce, that the present expedient of the **British** Government has been tried, and has failed in every instance in which it has been put to the test.

* For that period he has helped to maintain a selfish barrier around the State of Victoria against the rest of Australia, and particularly against the rest of the **British** Empire.

* Then I take it that the honorable member does not mean to applaud the proposal to admit **British** goods into our market free of duty.

* And yet we now have a proposal before us under which we should be enabled to send our products into  the **British** market and compete still more seriously with the **British** agriculturist.

* Exactly ; what comfort would the **British** agriculturist derive from the fact that his ruin was being brought about by the competition.

* If the **British** farmer is ruined he is ruined whether it be by the American, the Russian, or the Australian producer, and he would have no preference between them.

* They propose to continue the process which has ruined the **British** agriculturist, and propose only to change the ruinworker.

* They are quite unwilling to reduce any of the duties which are at present levied upon **British** goods.

* They say that they will give a preference to Great Britain by imposing higher duties upon goods other than **British** goods, but they will not lower any of the duties which are at present operative on articles of **British** manufacture.

* In other words, whilst they talk of bestowing a preference upon **British** goods, they really wish to sneak in a further measure of protection.

* Instead of sticking to the good old **British** principle of representative government.

* This class of legislation is not only unfair to men in other parts of the **British** possessions, who ought to be free to come here without being compelled to go cap-in-hand to the Minister, but it is unfair to this House, because it places in the hands of Ministers powers which should be exercised by the Legislature.

* Does the honorable andi learned member mean that the Government of the Commonwealth is as important asthe **British** Government  1 
Any territory placed by the Queen under the-, authority of, and accepted by the Commonwealth,, we should, as far as possible, use thosewords.

* The very circumstances.that the Administrator can no longercarry on without further supplies of money,, and that the islands attached to the **British** New Guinea Government also require to beimmediately administered, would make it a. great pity if Australia did not now take the opportunity held out by the **British** Government, and accept the proposal which  Mr. Chamberlain  has made - that the Commonwealth shall take over **British** New Guinea  and administer it.

* If we admit **British** New Guinea as part of tine Commonwealth, we have to extend to that territory equality of trade and commerce.

* If we extend the Commonwealth so as to include **British** New Guinea, we shall find  ourselves in the position that our sugar planters can go to New Guinea and employ labour there ; and it would be quite impossible for us to say that the natives of that country are not to be employed in the industries of the territory itself.

* Honorable members will have to consider  that section carefully before **British** New j 
The honorable member might as well suggest that we might throw the surplus into the Yarra.

* The **British** are a practical people, and every proposal made by this Parliament must be a sound one, if it is to be approved by the electors.

* I have not the least objection to obtaining as much of the information desired by the honorable member for Canoblas as can be secured from the records in my office, which consist of the annual reports and despatches relating to the area of land that has been sold or leased from the date of **British** occupancy of the Possession.

* The first is whether the land system of **British** New Guinea should be one of leasing exclusively, and the second, whether we are in a position to decide that matter at the present moment.

* I do not agree that the sole purpose of the acquisition of **British** New Guinea was to provide for the better military defence of the Commonwealth.

* The debate dealt with the class of population that would occupy **British** New Guinea, or which was originally there, the indigenous products, the products acclimatized or fit to be acclimatized, and the general question of development.

* It was put forward that by reason of its geographical position **British** New Guinea was fit to be held with Australia.

* It will besituated in a population of nearly 4,000,000, and therefore it presents a wholly different aspect from the case presented by **British** New Guinea.

* The distinction between the Federal territory and **British** New Guinea is that we are fairly satisfied that the principle can be applied to the Federal territory as a business transaction.

* Those considerations do not apply in the case of **British** New Guinea.

* It will be difficult to settle **British** New Guinea, but I take leave to say, as amatter of illustration, that no difficulty will be experienced in settling the Federal capital.

* We find **British** New Guinea differently situated.

* They are influenced by the theory that we, as part of the **British** Empire, must join forces with, and practically merge our naval defence, in the general defence of the Empire.

* I learn from Brassey's  Naval Annual  that, during the last **British** naval evolutions, Admiral Wilson, who was in command of the attacking squadron in the English Channel, was able, in spite of the fact that a fleet, numerically stronger than his own, was on the look-out for him in the same waters, to proceed without molestation over a distance of over 170 miles, to relieve .

* While a number of us - and, I think, a large proportion of the people of Australia - are quite prepared to continue the old agreement, or an agreement on the basis of the old one, pending an opportunity to establish an Australian Navy, we find that the Prime Minister, animated by the spirit of a new-born Imperialism - which seems to me to be a rather dangerous element to animate a gentleman representing such a small fraction of the total white population of the **British** Empire - has, in this instance, tentatively agreed to an arrangement by which we altogether lose the control of a fleet that formerly had some special Australian significance.

* If the honorable member for New England believes that we have a right to make a general contribution towards the **British** Navy, apart from Australian defence, he is welcome to that belief, and I have no quarrel with him, although personally I do not agree with such a view.

* Getting back to the apparent suggestion of the honorable member for New England, I say that if the honorable member holds the view that we have a right to contribute to the general up-keep of the **British** Navy as an institution, I, for one, dissent from that view.

* I say that even as most loyal subjects of the Empire, and desiring, as we -all should, to see the Empire extended in all reason and developed to the utmost possible extent, it is still no part of our duty to help forward or maintain the **British** Navy as an .

* To say that we should take part in a general movement for the expansion of the Empire and for the maintenance of the **British** Navy, no matter what aspect the navy may take or to what extent it may grow, is to put forward a view with which only a comparatively small section of the,  people  of Australia will sympathize.

* If we are equally interested with the people of Great Britain in the maintenance of the **British** Navy, then it is not enough that we should contribute ls.

* I ask the honorable member for New England and other honorable members who support the view to which he has given expression, if they are prepared to go before their constituents and recommend that seven-eighths of  1  per head should be raised annually in order that they may contribute their share to the up-keep of the **British** Navy?

* The mixture of the Europeans with the Indian races has produced half-castes known as Eurasians, who are not acceptable to the **British** race.

* From what ranks of society are you going to get the men who will defend Australia in the future if it is not from the class which the members of the labour party represent, the class from which T have sprung, and the class which is defending the Empire all over the world % The honorable member for Echuca said last night - and I took down his words so as not to be mistaken - that the labour party have decried the **British** Navy.

* Our fathers and mothers were  **British**,  and the material has not changed, as was proved in South Africa.

* We shall not have as much then as we have nov", because the Naval Reserve will belong to the **British** Navy.

* No doubt the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence propose what they think best in the interests of the Commonwealth, and deserve credit for doing so ; but the members of the party to which I belong have surely the right to say what they think on the subject, without being called disloyalists and  separationists,  and being accused of decrying the **British** Navy  1  I ask honorable members what will they tell the electors on the hustings in regard to this expenditure ?

* When the Prime Minister went to England he had no mandate from the people to make this agreement with the **British** Government, and I am sorry to say that, because of the good treatment which he received there, or for some other reason, he succumbed to temptation.

* If such a large proportion of our trade, as has been stated, is carried in **British** ships, the argument' of the honorable member for New England falls to.

* Then it must be remembered that Australians have contributed large sums of money for the construction and equipment of new forts for the protection of the harbors which are available to **British** war vessels as bases, at which they can obtain coal or provisions.

* I can quite imagine the  Minister for Defence being present as our representative at the Imperial councils of 
Endless difficulties would also arise in connexion with the special rates of pay to Australian seamen in the **British** Navy,, especially when a ship so manned moved to other stations, as Lord Selborne suggests and desires.

* The Australian rates are those actually paid to the permanent men in Victoria, while the highest **British** rates quoted are- above anything I can find in the Navy List.

* It is also worth while to note the following rates in the **British** Navy - 
We should, therefore, have in Australia **British** sub-lieutenants drawing less pay than their petty officers, and midshipmen worse off than the lowest-rated seaman.

* I have fixed that ap-e because the **British** sailor is entitled to a pension after he has served 21 years.

* A **British** seaman gets ls.

* And why is the Mediterranean Squadron maintained except for the defence of **British** interests  1  No one could defend Australia better than Australians.

* I would further point out that, under this Bill, Australia will become a recruiting ground for the **British** Navy.

* The generous allowance of space or tonnage for coal and stores (especially for stores), required by the **British** cruisers, would- be unnecessary for Australian service.

* The hope of **British** survival in the Pacific is.

* The mere fact of having to drag across the globe almost every single thing necessary for the repair and equipment of **British** ships is a heavy handicap in war with a nation or nations having the necessary sustaining power, so to speak,' on' the spot.

* I maintain that we have sprung from **British** stock, that we have the same brains, and!

* Captain Creswell also gives an extract from the  United Service Gazette  of the 27th July, 1901- 
A continuance of the present policy involves either the periodical increase of the amount paid to the Imperial Government for Naval Defence, that the growing trade and interests of the Federation may be adequately protected, or, if that amount be not increased, we must expect a justifiable complaint from the **British** taxpayer.

* In the event of a European combination of such strength as to occupy the attention of the **British** fleets, the continuance of a policy which in noway advances Australian ability for sea defence might have disastrous consequences.

* The Prime Minister, in introducing the Naval Subsidy Bill, never explained that the agreement of 1887 was suggested by the Admiralty themselves solely to enable an Australianowned Squadron to relieve the **British** fleet of the necessity of protecting floating trade in Australasian waters from the attacks of chance raiders in time of war.

* Then, as now, the **British** Squadron in these waters merely formed part of the general strength of the **British** fleet in Eastern waters - that is, of the combined Indian, China, and Australian Squadrons.

* Then, as now, it was essential that in time oE war the various sections of the **British** fleet should combine to deal concentrated blows on the enemy ; it followed that the coast of Australia would be left without any local naval protection, such as Great Britain herself enjoys, and the Admiralty therefore in 1885, honestly admitting the fact that local naval protection was quite as  necessary  for Australia as the general protection she would derive from squadrons of **British** battle-ships iu action, advised the Australian States to purchase a fleet, and to arrange to protect their own coasts with their own seamen from the raids of scattered cruisers.

* To-day the Admiralty suggest that local naval defence should be abandoned altogether, and that the 100,000 paid annually, as a rent for a local defence squadron, should be paid instead to the **British** fleet as a subsidy, with 94,000 more thrown in, making 200,000 in all.

* It is idle to suggest that the **British** fleet in Eastern waters will be one ship or one gun the stronger for this subside' !

* - We should provide with certainty for repelling any raiders that might manage, to escape the **British** fleet.

* - We shall help to consolidate a sense of nationality throughout the Commonwealth, which it sadly lacks at present, and which the subsidy to the **British** fleet will never do.

* In reply to his statement that we have decried the **British** Navy, I will quote a pet phrase of the honorable member for Parramatta, and say that it is a figment of his own imagination.

* But I have too just a sense of the value of an expression of opinion by a public meeting in a **British** community to think that the parading of an armed force to attend that meeting will add to the weight of the decisions at which it arrives.

* These -are wise rules which promote the security, comfort, and stability of our great **British** communities.

* In this community, there have been those who held that, for naval defence, at any rate, we should subsidize the **British** Navy, throwing the whole burden on Great Britain.

* Hence we have submitted to us a measure, not to subsidize the **British** Fleet, and to limit the Commonwealth control of defence, but to provide for a greater measure of defence than could be provided for at the outset of Federation, or was thought likely, a short time ago, to be provided for so soon.

* In fact, throughout the **British** Empire it is remarkable that the greater the independence and the freer the hand, the more loyal the Dominions become.

* If the Commonwealth owes nothing else to the Fisher Government, it owes it a debt of gratitude for lifting this question out of the rut into which it had been thrown by the little Australians who considered that patriotism consisted of giving a subsidy to the **British** Navy.

* So far as I am concerned he is fishing in in an empty water hole, because I never objected to the training of Australian seamen in' the **British** Navy.

* Minister of Great Britain, who supported the Cabinet system, and whose son, at a later date, spoke in even more absolute terms regarding the state of affairs that has arisen under the system of Cabinet control in the **British** Parliament.

* Lord Hugh Cecil, son of the late Marquis of Salisbury, and a member of the present **British** Government, speaking in the House of Commons in March, 1901, used these remarkable words : - 
I think, as has been -observed by  Mr. Bernard  Holland in one of his works, that language such as that had hardly ever been heard " within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster since the days of Charles I."

* These were the words uttered by one of the most cynical and aristocratic members of the House of Commons, who has consistently flouted the opinions of members of that House, and who, as a member of the present **British** Ministry has applied, in the most brutal fashion, the "gag," as we may call it, when members have dared, in his opinion, to criticise too freely the actions of that all-powerful Government.

* The writer makes the following observations : - 
I think I have shown by these quotations that the process, which has been going on in the **British** Parliament, undoubtedly amounts, at the present time, to a usurpation, by the Government, of the rights and duties of Parliament.

* We should undoubtedly get back to what the honorable member says is the ideal of **British** development, the principle that Parliament represents the people of the country, and ought, therefore, to be supreme in all matters pertaining to legislation and administration.

* In that country, which" we all know has brought democratic principles into effect to a perhaps greater degree than has any other civilized community, the principle of electing Ministers by Parliament is working to much more advantage that can be claimed for the system operating at the present time in the various parts of the **British** Empire.

* What I was alluding to was this : that exemption certificates are not generally used in connexion with **British** subjects, and when the Agents-General in great Britain were authorized to issue those certificates, they were so informed.

* We understand that the **British** Government will have to take some step.

* That this House is prepared to accept **British** Now Guinea.

* We have power to order **British** vessels into quarantine; but the clause simply requires that if they trade regularly with Australian ports they must carry disinfecting apparatus.

* There is no evidence in the item of any intention to provide, in respect to paragraph  b,  for the preferential treatment of **British** imports.

* Does the honorable gentleman intend that there shall be no preferential treatment of **British** imports under this item?

* At once we are met with the cry that compulsion is foreign to the genius of the **British** race.

* When the first Factory Acts were introduced in England 100 years ago the cry was raised against them, both by employers and political economists, that they would have the effect of ruining **British** industry.

* This feeling on the part of the extreme reformers is, perhaps, similar to that which moves the **British** and American trades unionists in their opposition to compulsory arbitration.

* I believe that the ground on which the **British** and American unionists  oppose it to-day is that which led the trades unions of Australia to oppose it some twelve years ago.

* I say that it helped to sap the confidence of the **British** trades unions in the Judiciary, and set back the rising tide in favour of compulsory arbitration which, up to that time, had manifested itself in England.

* I contend that in the first place we have no right to seek to extend to **British** ships any conditions that we are unwilling to place on the shoulders of foreign ship-owners.

* I have a strong feeling in favour of giving privileges to **British** shipowners - including in the term, of course, our local ship-owners - which we would not extend to foreign ship-owners.

* I should like to ask the Prime Minister if the land referred to is not land acquired in the first instance by the Australian New Hebrides Company, a company consisting of citizens of the Commonwealth, and formed to preserve **British** interests in the New Hebrides ?

* I agree with the Minister that it would be a hardship to tax at the higher rates of duty **British** goods which may have been im ported in foreign bottoms, and which were upon the high seas prior to the introduction of the resolutions embodied in this Bill.

* Forces such as the .honorable and learned member is proposing to raise would be of no use whatever for the defence of Australia against invasion if the command of the seas passed from the **British** Empire.

* He declared that our dependence upon the **British** Navy must yearly become less and less satisfactory.

* The **British** dispositions have been made with a view to having an adequate naval force upon the spot the moment there is an outbreak of war.

* The **British** Admiralty have given effect to that policy, and in consequence the honorable and learned member for West Sydney has mistaken their motive.

* What was the total tonnage passing through the Suez Canal in 1907, and of this what amount was **British** and **British** trading with Australia respectively ?

* nage,  (b)  **British**,  (c)  **British** trading with Australia in 1907?

* Seeing the great tax this charge is on Australian commerce, can he see his way, now that his other representations with the Canal Company have apparently failed, to confer with the other **British** communities interested as to the possibility of a second Suez Canal, which shall be entirely **British** owned and controlled?

* The spectacle 'of the Australian Ministers at the Imperial Conference battering at a door, which they knew could never be opened, in order to obtain for Australia advantages which could be gained only by the taxation of the necessaries of life of the overcrowded population of the mother country, and, at the same time, practically withdrawing Australia's small contribution to the **British** Navy, was a very melancholy one.

* The **British** people have never posed as a community insisting upon any  contribution  from Australia.

* He sat there and listened to an appeal by the Prime Minister of Australia that the **British** Government should consent to the Naval Agreement being so dealt with that we should be able by a method of our own to take up.

* Notwithstanding all that Great Britain has done, and is doing, for us, in granting us the protection of the flag, whilst we carry out our own policy - a policy distasteful and, in some aspects, dangerous to **British** policy in other seas - there has been no attempt 'on the part of her Government to influence us.

* Even in respect of the rate of **British** preferential duty, there has been an increase of too per cent.

* Theduty upon **British** moleskins has been increased.

* I object to this abjectly mean business of going to the **British** people and saying, "We have built half the arch, you build the other half, and drop the keystone in, and we will have a perfect union between the mother country and Australia through the medium of this Tariff."

* The **British** people must have an extraordinary idea of the cheek of Australians.

* Two members of a Commonwealth Ministry, kept in power by the Labour Party, go to the oldcountry to buttress up the prospects of the Tories of England, and to  bring about the imposition of a tax by which the **British** landlord hopes to increase the value of his land !

* Wire netting, which was previously free, is, in the case of **British** imports, subject to a duty of  25  per cent., while imports from other countries are dutiable at  30  per cent.

* There are increases over and over again, and I admit that in some instances the difference between the rates on **British** exports and those on foreign exports may, incidentally, be of service to.

* But, taking the Tariff as a whole, there is a great difference between the oratory to which Ministers treated the **British** people when in England, and the practical concession which they are now giving to them.

* Funnier still, the  Age  and the old Protection crowd that yelped themselves hoarse at the " impudent interference " of Labour Member Ramsay Macdonald when he expressed his views on the Australian political situation, are quite delighted at Deakin's interference in **British** politics.

* My first comment is that it is extraordinary that the Government, who have in their  possession at the present moment an official report of what took place at the Conference, should deliberately - I say deliberately because the report has been asked for - withhold from this House a record in which we could have seen exactly what our delegates said, and what the **British** Ministers said in answer to them, and used the information as material for this debate.

* One cannot say that the head of the Government had not early notice of the attitude **British** statesmen intended to adopt in regard to the matters which were to come before the Conference.

* Laurier, the Right Honorable  Sir Henry  Campbell-Bannerman, and other prominent statesmen have done, that the principle upon which the **British** Empire rests is the absolute and unfettered freedom of all its parts.

* It is strange to hear of the unsympathetic attitude of 45,000,000 of people towards 4,000,000, who have even shut their, doors against the admission of **British** manufacturers and emigrants.

* If preferential trade had received its death-blow at the hands of the **British** Government, Australia would regret it, but he did not think it would cause many of its four million inhabitants to pass sleepless nights.

* **British** people to try to take a hand in the Tariff affairs of the Commonwealth.

* I am quite sure that the majority of people - and I include even protectionists - agree with  Mr. Joshua  that it is quite impossible to offer anything to England in the nature 01 a preference so long as we are determined to impose high duties upon **British** goods in order to foster our.

* I remember that, at a meeting of the **British** Empire League in London, when there was some proposal that that body should take up the question of preferential trade, the Duke of Devonshire declared that he was rot only opposed to it upon the ground that it might separate the forces of the League, but because he believed that the moment they attempted to impose upon the Colonies some restriction upon their liberty in regard to Tariff legislation, and the moment that they attempted to impose similar restrictions upon the liberty of the English people, they would be creating friction.

* Again, I have heard the **British** Empire compared to a commercial corporation, a partnership, but here also I think the parallel is poverty-stricken, and falls far below the reality at which we should aim.

* If you can, by some arrangement with the Colonies, prevent that tendency in respect of them - if you can prevent new manufacturing vested interests being created - if you can keep open for all time an open market, or a market approaching to an open market, for **British** manufactured goods, do you not think you might be doing something as a contribution to free-trade principles and benefit to the Empire.

* Mr. Balfour  was under the impression that if England would only do something in that direction Australia would be prepared to forsake the development of her manufacturing interests and open her ports to **British** manufactures.

* As  a  matter of fact, **British** statesmen - with the exception of those in high office, who are able to have reports condensed for 
I have no doubt that it is, and that it will be reduced to a much greater extent.

* These honorable gentlemen, who went to England, actually asked the **British** people to differentiate between the fiscal treatment- of Germany and that of Australia.

* One of the first steps would, probably, be an import duty on wool, which would be in favour of Argentine, and then we should have the squatters of Australia pointing out that one of the natural consequences of inducing the **British** people to differentiate between Australia and Germany was that Germany differentiated between Australia and other woolproducing countries.

* Without preference it was doubtful whether Australia could maintain her position in **British** markets.

* I am not surprised that Australia should not maintain a position in **British** markets, when it is considered that England has all her manufactures at hand ; and it is absurd to suppose that Australia could send manufactured articles there with any success.

* From beginning to end it is one long moan - a miserable appeal to the **British** people to have pity on Australia, and to close their ports against foreign imports in order to help us, just as though we were some poverty-stricken nation which could not help itself.

* They are put forward as representing the corporate opinion of the Australian people, and they lead the **British** people to think that we are mean, contemptible, and greedy, and without any consideration for their interests.

* As a citizen of Australia, I protest against representations of that sort going forth to the **British** people through the **British** press, and giving a false impression of Australian sentiment, gratitude, and mag- nanim.it v towards the old country.

* In the first place, think of our .Customs duties and of our treatment of **British** subjects, who, when they desired to come to Australia, found themselves restricted.

* There is no part of the **British** Dominions which has done more, by its legislation, to disintegrate the Empire than has Australia.

* The people of this country have not read the reasons advanced by **British** statesmen in answering the so-called arguments of our Prime Minister and Minister of Trade and Customs, and will not have an opportunity to do so while the report of the Conference is withheld by the Government.

* The purchasing power of India in **British** markets is largely dependent on her trade with foreign countries.

* This is shown by the export and import figures, which show that the **British** Empire sells 50,000,000 worth of goods to India, and buys 39,500,000 sterling, whilst foreign countries sell to India 18 million sterling worth of goods, and buy goods to the value of 66 million sterling.

* He noted that other papers showed that though the volume of **British** trade had largely increased, the proportion of it as between the Colonies and foreign countries remained practically constant.....

* The Canadian Tariff had been beneficial to **British** trade rather by stopping decrease than by actual increase in proportion to the total trade.

* Preferential rates were given only to goods in **British** ships, manned by white labour, and this was a serious consideration, as it involved a policy which  His  Majesty's Government could not but deprecate.

* of the trade, and it would appear that the profit to the **British** importer might amount to about 90,000 to 100,000 in the year as a maximum.

* He added that the representatives of Great Britain refused upon the grounds I have indicated to interfere with the **British** Tariff and with the people's food supply, which it was essential should be taxed if the mother country were to comply with our wishes.

* He would be glad to apply Canada's lower preferential Tariff to all **British** Colonies.

* Instead of its being a Conference of representatives of the different parts of the Empire to consider what they should do - even if it involved a little sacrifice on their own part - to consolidate the Empire, the Australian representatives obviously attended with a view to securing some advantage, to whine and moan over Australian conditions - as though they were bad - and to go crying to the **British** Government to grant them concessions.

* The proposal to establish a Secretariat was merely an endeavour to improve the position of Australia by placing it more upon an equality with the **British** Government than it would be under the Colonial Office.

* I ask honorable members to note that statement, because I shall use it for the purpose of showing how thoroughly unfair he was in commenting upon **British** institutions in order that he might get his own way.

* He would have liked to be able to say, " I have established a new Department of the **British** Empire - a Department which entirely severs Colonial supervision from the Colonial Office."

* Without authority he represented to the **British** people that Australians were discontented with the administration of the Colonial Office.

* Instead of clamouring for something for his country, he said plainly  to the **British** Government, " We wish you to grant a preference to us, but we do not attempt to press you, because we recognise that you understand better than we do the circumstances of your people and your country."

* The Canadian Government presented its views at the previous Conference, and it was for the **British** people to say whether they would accept them or not at the proper time.

* My honorable friend  Mr. Borden  has stated that the resolution adopted bv the **British** Conference in 1902 was adopted at the suggestion of Canadian Ministers.

* We have given to the **British** people a preference under our Tariff.

* But we have stated that if it suits the **British** people to reciprocate we shall be prepared to discuss the question, and go a step further than we have yet gone.

* It is not for us at this moment, and it is not for me on behalf of the Canadian people, to press this matter on the **British** people.

* The only way in which the **British** Empire can be maintained upon its present foundation is by allowing every nation composing it the measure of liberty that it has, and also a free choice of the fiscal policy which it is to maintain.

* For my part I may say frankly, if I had my own view, if I were asked what would be an ideal condition within the **British** Empire, what policy would tend to build the **British** Empire upon an even stronger basis than it has at present - if that were possible - it would be to have a universal system of free-trade between all the parts that compose the **British** Empire.

* Thirty per cent, duties on **British** goods and the exclusion of **British** people !

* Surely if she were able to get a steady supply at the  same  or lower rates, the **British** people ought to be willing to take it from their own flesh and blood.

* He emphasized the disproportionate growth of foreign shipping and manufactures in the harbors of Australia compared with the beggarly increases, and, in some cases, decreases, of **British** trade.

* Who has decreased **British** trade with Australia?

* While Australia, he said, in conclusion, expected for many years to bc dependent on the **British** Navy, yet it would shortly be proved that Australia was prepared to help herself, and also to help the motherland, as far as the Navy was concerned.

* If the **British** Government proposed free-trade within the Empire, combined with a tariff wall against the outside world, Australia would consider it with an open mind.

* It is possible that, through neglect of the study of history, some young Australians have not been as much impressed as we older ones are with our obligations to the **British** Empire.

* The message continued - 
As one of the guardians of the Empire, he warned the **British** Government that trade was slipping away.

* That statement was an absolute misrepresentation of fact, as one of the **British** Ministers showed.

* Suppose one puts the converse, and asks what difference has the Minister of Trade and Customs or the Prime Minister made between the **British** and foreigners?

* Indeed, the **British** people, althoughkith and kin of Australians, have been dealt with as foreigners under the Immigration Restriction Act, having been kept out of this country.

* He, at any rate, has never shown any liberality towards the **British** people by proposing to treat them differently from Frenchmen, Germans, or Americans.

* At a meeting of the London Chamber of Commerce, the honorable gentleman -  complained of  Mr. Asquith  's action in  reasserting the fiction that the Premiers had demanded preference on raw materials required for **British** manufactures.

* In the  **British** Australasian,  under the heading " Offensive negatives.

* At first, he spoke of **British** statesmen as brusque and discourteous.

* Since the Conference ended,  Mr. Deakin  and  Dr. Jameson  have thrown themselves into the work of abusing and ridiculing in public the English nation's way of managing this intimately domestic affair of taxation.....  Mr. Deakin  and  Dr. Jameson  have relinquished the character of representatives of **British** Colonies for that of assailants of.

* In this way, all prices would be raised to the **British** consumer, and thousands would be taken out of his pocket annually, and transferred to that of the Australian stockman.

* No; the whole purpose of the scheme is to fleece the **British** public for the benefit of men who are never tired of boasting how much better off they are than the " effete " dwellers in these Islands.

* How refreshing it is to turn from the froth and fume of these Australians to the calm, dignified, and statesman-like language of  Sir Wilfrid  Laurier and General Botha, neither ofthem of **British** blood, but both of them imbued with a sound, **British** Imperialism.

* Preference, both of them declared to the Conference, was not a question which should be pressed upon the **British** people ; they must deal with it in the way they thought best for themselves, and no matter what their decision was, the attachment of the Colonies they represented to the Mother Country would not be in the slightest degree diminished.

* It was a good stout door of **British** oak, and the largest Liberal, Radical, and Labour majority ever seen in the House of Commons had their backs firmly against it.

* I had shown to me only yesterday a letter written to an Australian citizen by the editor of the  **British** Weekly,  a magazine which exercises much influence all over the Empire.

* In this private letter the editor writes - 
Great Britain, as some of her **British** Ministers seem already to understand, that the protectionists of this country, and certainly that objectionable section of the Protectionist Party which is trying to force its doctrines upon England, do not represent the whole of Australia.

* Our delegates were to .confer with the **British** authorities on the best and most equitable and desirable laws to regulate the stupendous body of shipping which trades between Great Britain and the ports of the Commonwealth.

* The Royal Commission, the shipowners' statement asserted, founded in great measure their recommendations on the decline in the number of **British** seamen employed on **British** ships between i860 and 1900, and also on the increased proportion of trade of the world carried by foreign vessels during the same period.

* As to these statements, the shipowners pointed out that although since 1870 the number of **British** merchant sailors had decreased from 200,000 to 176,000, the Admiralty had practically taken the cream of the men anxious to engage as sailors.

* The one report honorable members will see, was the off-hand, superficial view of the situation, no allowance being made for the fact, as this paper shows, that the Navy had taken the cream of the sea-faring men of Great Britain to such an extent as to involve an aggregate addition of 129,000 to the number of men engaged in shipping in the **British** Empire - 
Thus in thirty years there had been  a  total increase of 35,000 **British** seamen employed in both services.

* Referring to the special conditions the Commonwealth Bill proposed to enforce on ships engaged in the coastal trade, the ship-owners asserted that the liners constitute but a small proportion of **British** shipping.

* This ability to go anywhere and accept all employmentoffering had been one of the most important factors in building up the **British** mercantile marine.

* Divers standards must act as toll bars to the **British** mercantile marine, and as a bounty to the foreigner to the extent that the same disabilities cannot be imposed on them.

* If this is injurious to **British** shipping it will be equally injurious to the trade of the Empire.

* That is a very fair summary of the opinions of the **British** ship-owners, and every honorable member will see a great deal of force in the reasons advanced.

* If the great bulk of the **British** shipping consists of trampships, which have to go from one part of the world to another, and do not know from time to time where their next port may be, it stands to reason that if throughout the Empire there are different standards of efficiency, and different structural standards, which must be observed, it is quite impossible to carry on this enormous shipping business.

* He attacked the decisions of the Navigation Conference so far as they affected **British** shipping, and complained that the great lineTS  would be subjected to heavy losses through structural alterations and wages if they were forced to conform to the standards enforced in the Australian coastal trade.

* Also a positive advantage would be given to foreign trade between the Empire and foreign countries as compared with trade within the various portions of the Empire if goods could  only  travel direct within the Empire in **British** ships, while goods from foreign countries had the choice of either **British** or foreign ships.

* So far as the United Kingdom was concerned, the interests of **British** shipping were not prejudiced by the very small amount of foreign shipping entering our coasting trade.

* Mr. Deakin referred to Australia's need for population, and expressed a hope that the Conference would devise such machinery as would secure her as the home of a **British** population.

* Could anything be more ridiculous or laughable than for  Mr. Deakin  who, in 1902, not only passed, but practically fathered, the Act, to shut out **British** people where they were under contract, and to shut out European people unless they could pass our education test, to go to England and ask the English people to help to devise some means of populating Australia?

* Mr. Deakin referred to Australia's need for population, and expressed a hope that the Conference would devise such machinery as would secure her as the home of a **British** population.

* That it is desirable to encourage **British** emigrants to proceed to the **British** Colonies rather than to foreign countries.

* not desire that the **British** Government shall be approached, cap in hand, and asked to lend us officials to do work which should be done in the offices of our Agents-General.

* Who ever heard of a **British**, or even a European immigrant, being refused admission to Australia prior to the passing of the Immigration Restriction Act?

* We all thought, when the defence arrangements of the six States were controlled by the Commonwealth authority, that an expert should be imported to advise us as to our military defence; and the Government of the day, on the recommendation of the **British** authorities, chose Major-General  Sir Edward  Hutton for the work.

* I repeat that there was not a tittle of justification for the statement of the honorable and learned gentleman, and seme authoritative communication ought to be forwarded to the **British** Government pointing out that he has not had the courage even to mention the matter in the Viceregal Speech.

* We depend upon the presence of the **British** Fleet in the Pacific, and it would not suit us from a commercial stand-point to have that fleet leave the precincts of Australia simply because we chose to discontinue our naval contribution.

* The right honorable gentleman went to England, and propounded a magnificent document upon the subject of the **British** Navy, presumably on behalf of his Government.

* If the **British** nation is at war, so are we; if it gains victories or suffers disaster, so do we ; and, therefore, it is of the same vital interest to us as to the rest of the Empire that our supremacy on the ocean shall be maintained.

* Our aim and object should be to make the Royal Navy the Empire's Navy, supported by the whole of the self-governing portions of the Empire, and solely supported by the people of the **British** Isles as is practically the case at the present time.

* c 
Captain Creswell, it will thus be seen, has no idea of substituting anything for the **British** Fleet which is to act as our protection beyond our shores.

* I am satisfied that he would fix upon a point somewhere between Australia and China and Japan, because if, in the near future, Australia were menaced, as some people fear, by any nation, it would be by what are described as the " hordes of yellow races " who might seek to reach our northern shores, since they are not being used as they ought to be by the **British** people now occupying Australia.

* It is direct between **British** possessions and foreign countries or among **British** dominions.

* The part of the total trade of the United Kingdom which is carried on with **British** dominions is also about a fourth.

* In another passage we have a very interesting fact as showing the benefit which Australia and the other great Colonial possessions are deriving from the **British** Navy - 
When I hear honorable members declaring that we ought not to contribute to the cost of the **British** Navy because it is designed simply to protect the trade of Great Britain, I feel constrained to remind them that more than half of the trade of the four great Colonies- in the Empire never goes near England, and that, therefore, the **British** Navy would be under no obligation to defend them if it were not intended to protect the interests of the Colonies as well as of Great Britain itself.

* I should like to show the House how the **British** authorities received the statement by the Prime Minister that the naval subsidy was unpopular, and that the Australian people desired to divert the money from the coffers of the Admiralty into some other channel of expenditure.

* Nothing is more dignified than the way in which **British** statesmen deal with- the whims and fancies of the outlying parts of the Empire.

* We must realize that a miserable paltry sum of ^200,000, which, possibly, would be spent upon some local defence in a couple of years, is a very small consideration to the **British** people, having regard to their total defence expenditure.

* It shows the dignity and the independence of the **British** people that they recognise in us some childish quality which prompts us to have one whim to-day and another tomorrow.

* The Prime Minister, without authority, gives expression to this whim of his that we should stop our contribution to the **British** Navy, and the.

* Lord Tweedmouth went on to say that - 
I have it on excellent authority that, apart altogether from wages, from disbursements in respect of wages, the annual expenditure of the **British** Navy in Australia is 300,000.

* And we are giving a paltry sum of  1  80,000, plus the ,20,000 voted by New Zealand, to compensate the **British** 
Navy for sending their vessels here.

* They would do so in a spirit of loyalty to the mother country, and because of a feeling of gratitude for the great benefits we have already derived from the **British** Navy.

* He would consult his colleagues and Parliament, recommending this course, and leaving New Zealand free to make her own arrangements with the **British** Government for the defence of the Colony.

* It is true that some unsuccessful litigants have from time to time spoken depreciatingly of the Privy Council, but no one who knows anything about the complexities of the law doubts that that tribunal embraces some of the ablest Judges in the **British** Empire.

* Honorable members may be aware that the Privy Council is reserved as a Court of Appeal for all the **British** Dominions, while the House of Lords is the Court of Appeal for all the Courts of Great Britain.

* No Court in Great Britain can be appealed from to the Privy Council, and no Court in the **British** Colonies can be appealed, from to the House of Lords; they are two distinct tribunals, though the same men frequently act in both.

* It is nonsense for the right honorable gentleman to argue that, because a very considerable majority of the people of this country are in favour of the policy of the **British** Government, and have so expressed themselves, therefore that is not within the category of political questions.

* Can it be argued seriously that a meeting which is to have submitted to it resolutions declaring that it approves of the policy of the **British** Government in regard to the.

* The promoters of the meeting were clever enough to bracket together two objects, namely, that of expressing approval of the action of the **British** Government, and the farewelling of the soldiers.

* policy of the **British** Government.

* If I disapproved of the policy of the **British** Government, which 
I do not, there would be nothing whatever to prevent rae from voting in favour of sending troops abroad.

* The Government would have  acted wisely, on seeing that political resolutions were to be submitted to the meeting in Adelaide, if they had pointed out that whilst the Government and the Parliament were largely in sympathy with the object of the meeting it would be against all precedent and contrary to the' traditions of the **British** Army to allow soldiers to participate.

* The citizens themselves were able then to vindicate the loyalty and honour of the city of Sydney without calling upon the military to assist them, and the loyalty of the people of the **British** Empire can find its truest expression in old-fashioned public meetings, where resolutions are carried on the voices, and with applause, without the assistance of either military uniforms or arms.

* The Imperial Government have arranged to withdraw the **British** silver now in circulation in Australia, at the rate of 100,000 a year ; and the coin withdrawn will be replaced, with the new Australian coinage.

* A proposal is before the Cabinet for the establishment of wireless communication with the principal islands in the Pacific under **British** influence, upon w7hich an agreement is anticipated.

* In even contemplating any disaster to the **British** nation - our own nation - the home of our fathers- we cannot but bow our heads in gratitude and affection to " This other Eden " .

* we have made compared to the benefits we have derived from being a part of the **British** Empire, and under the protection of the **British** flag?

* Before concluding, however, I should like in a few words to survey our .position as a part of the **British** nation on this continent - a continent "compassed by the inviolate sea," a continent containing 2,000,000,000 acres, with a coast-line of 12,000 miles - all **British** territory, no other nation having any right or title to any part of it; a splendid .heritage in the Southern Hemisphere ; another home for the **British** race.

* **British** - and it is interesting as well as gratifying to note what these four and a-half millions have done and are doing.

* **British**, or **British** Possessions, and 27 per cent, foreign.

* **British**, and 40 per cent, foreign.

* This is a splendid record for 4,500,000 of **British** people, on a great continent, and should give us cause for good hope for the future, and gratitude in reflecting on the past.

* He started as a man who denounced in the most unmeasured terms the proposal to pay a subsidy to the **British** Navy.

* I sum up my attitude upon this subject by stating that I regard these projects as wild and impracticable; as being not founded in necessity or even in prudence, but as arising either from hysterical fear or from a craze for militarism that is foreign to the history and the spirit of the **British** race.

* When the preferential Tariff with Great Britain was under discussion, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie succeeded in carrying an amendment providing for the employment of only **British** seamen on vessels carrying goods upon which preference was  granted, and the right honorable member for East Sydney said - 
The refusal of the Prime Minister to act on my advice and endeavour in a fuller House to omit the condition about **British** seamen has exposed the wretched sham.

* Such persons, in order to possess a qualification under the Queensland Elections Act, must be naturalized or natural born **British** subjects.

* By reference to the **British** Naturalization Act of 1870 we find that provision is made that any alien can be naturalized in England, no matter where he comes from, and, therefore, if he becomes naturalized in England he is a naturalized **British** subject within the terms of the Queensland Electoral Acts.

* But some of these South Sea Islanders are subjects of no power, some are subjects of foreign powers, some are natural-born **British** subjects.

* If by the law of the State of Queensland any South Sea Islander who is a natural-born **British** subject can acquire the franchise, then the South Sea Islanders should not be excluded from thecount.

* I think that the **British** bondholder is always open to accept a consideration, and it is quite possible that he might be prepared to surrender his stock upon terms.

* ordinary reader would at once interpret those words as meaning that only recent legislation and recent debates had evidenced any desire on the part of the **British** Parliament to deal justly with Ireland.

* It appears to me that the statement conveys a deliberate and direct insult to the **British** Parliament, and I am surprised that any honorable member should have had the audacity to submit a motion couched in such objectionable terms, and implying such charges.

* If the **British** Parliament passed a resolution, of this character, dealing with some legislation within the special domain of the Commonwealth, and such a resolution were officially conveyed to us, we should not only resent it, but we should be fully justified in doing so.

* Although many regrettable mistakes have been made in the past in connexion with legislation dealing with Irish affairs, they have not been due to deliberate attempts on the part of the **British** Parliament to deal unjustly with Ireland, but have arisen from misconception, or from misunderstandings of one.

* The next sentence, however, reads as follows: -  but the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic or social conditions of Ireland.

* That is a sweeping charge against the **British** Parliament, for which there is no justification.

* Although mistakes have been made in the past, I believe that the **British** Parliament is perfectly capable of understanding and effectively dealing with the economic and social conditions of Ireland, or of any other part of the Empire over which it has jurisdiction.

* Every honorable member of this House would resent any attempt on the part of the **British** Parliament to interfere .with, matters of Commonwealth concern, over which we have direct control, and I decline to become a party to the passing of any resolution which might result in our receiving a well-deserved snub at the hands of the Imperial Parliament.

* Our men held their own against the **British** officers during that miserable and wicked war, and it is time that we stood up for Australians and gave them the highest positions that they have the brains and capacity to fill.

* He pointed out that it could not be expected that 75,000 Lascars and foreigners who were employed in the **British** mercantile marine would fight the battles of England, and that landsmen could not do it because thev had not been trained as sailors.

* It was shown that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company was one of the worst offenders in the whole world in regard to doing away with the employment of **British** seamen on **British** ships.

* The noblest aspirations of the **British** race will find expression in this great country, which we want to make a white man's land.

* They cannot understand why_ 4,000,000 of **British**  people,  living 13,000 miles away from the Motherland, and admittedly suffering from lack of population, should exclude the occasional **British** artisan or labourer, against whom the section is aimed.

* Had I anything to do with the legislation of the Commonwealth, I should say to the people of Great Britain, " Our doors are open to every **British** citizen who likes to come to us, whether he be farmer, workman, or labourer."

* I congratulate the Government on the view they take of the situation, and I shall stand by them in any honest attempt to increase the population of Australia by inducing **British** citizen's to come out on a liberal and rational basis.

* I hold in my hand a copy of the  **British** Australasian  for 23rdMay, 1907, which contains a report of what is known as his "deep-water" speech.

* Therefore, I propose, in justice to the honorable and learned gentleman, to put on record the report which appeared in the **British** newspaper.

* The speech, was addressed to a number of **British** financiers, and the report is headed "**British** Capital in Australia," with the sub-heading,  "Mr. Deakin  Explains the Position of the Labour Party."

* Mr. Deakin attended a luncheon last Thursday at De Keyser's Royal Hotel, in order to meet a number of representatives of **British** capital invested in Australasia.

* B. Braithwaite,  Mr. A.  H. P. Stoneham,  Mr. A.  C. Willis,  Mr. A.  F. Farish  Mr. Beckwith  Smith, and  Mr. Oliver  Wethered 

 Mr. Harmood Banner, M.P., in proposing " Continued success to the Commonwealth, and to **British** Interests Therein," said that they had met, as business men, to lay before  Mr. Deakin  certain matters in regard to which they thought he might help them.

* One of these was the question of making safe **British** capital invested in Australia.

* Mr. Braithwaite said that one of the things which had hindered a free flow of **British** capital into Australia was the diversity of the company laws in the different States.

* What is the **British** hold on India  1  It is the respect and veneration there felt for the administration of the **British** Government ; and if that respect be removed, I venture to believe there may exist another menace to Australia.

* We hear men talking in the lightest way about our ties with, and our need of support from the **British** Government.

* Where, in the name of all that is good and true, should we be in the face of these menaces at our northern shores, if we had not the **British** Government to fall back on  1 
We may imagine ourselves, and I hope we are, a great nation; but, considering bur enormous territory, we require a great many more millions of people here, before we can hope to effectively protect our coast-line.

* I have indicated that I appreciate the difficulties which face the Government in their desire to do what is reasonably right, and what they have justification for expecting the **British** Government will accept.

* But when we come to great- national interests, and consider our association with the mother land, with Canada, South Africa, and other **British** possessions, surely we must not inflate ourselves with too large ideas of our own importance, without considering, however great we are to be, that we still depend, not only on the moral support, but on the material support of the mother country.

* I could, if I desired, attempt to make some patriotic utterances upon such a splendid subject as the **British** Navy, and it would not be disagreeable to me to try to do so ; but I think with the leader of the  Opposi   tion that we have heard a good deal in regard to that side of the question, and therefore I propose, in the remarks which I shall ask honorable members to listen to, to deal with the matter, not so much on sentimental or patriotic grounds, but as a pure matter of  business.

* I think he forgot that if we were not part of the **British** Empire we should not  beable  to maintain  anyeffective naval defence  for so small a sum as 200,000 per annum.

* In addition te the Government captains we have our friend the captain from Bendigo, our friend the captain from Gippsland, and our friend the captain from Northern Melbourne, besides others: 
I should like to emphasize the exception which I take to the views of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports in his references to the **British** Navy.

* He referred to it as if it were something altogether apart from us ; as if, because our fathers years ago crossed the seas and founded this country, we were no longer **British** people, and had no pride or interest in the **British** Navy.

* He seemed to disregard the fact that we have had the protection of the **British** Navy from the day Australia became a **British** country.

* AVe have, I believe, always viewed the **British** Navy as our own.

* Although we now make only a very small contribution towards its upkeep, we receive as much from the **British** Navy as do the taxpayers at home.

* It is as much the navy of the people of Australia as it is the navy of the **British** taxpayer.

* He would request the loan of a ship from the **British** Government, and we should really go on as we have been doing in the past.

* I am quite prepared to admit that as far as outside defence, and the protection of our commerce is concerned, we ought to be prepared to make some contribution towards the maintenance of something like an efficient **British** fleet.

* past contributed a certain amount of money to the **British** Government towards the maintenance of certain war vessels on the Australian station, but I believe we shall, in a short time, have to increase that subsidy.

* However, what I wish to say is that, whilst I am opposed to the construction of a purely Australian Navy, at Australian expense and to be under Australian control, I trust the Government will ask the Parliament to rise to a proper conception of its responsibility and vote an adequate sum towards the support of the **British** Navy.

* We are at present contributing 126,000 per year towards the Australian auxiliary squadron, and it would be butter, even if we doubled this amount, to continue under the protection of the **British** Navy.

* We are endeavouring to enter into a partnership with the Imperial Government, under which we are to contribute a small amount which will represent about one-half of the direct burden, and but a very small part of the indirect burden which the **British** taxpayer has to bear on our behalf.

* The Australian squadron will cost about 500,000 a year ; towards which we shall contribute 200,000; but the total cost of the **British** fleet, which is available for our protection as well as for that of all other parts of the Empire, involves an annual outlay of 35,000,000.

* We are a free people, under a free form of government, and there is no hoop binding us to the 
Our aim and object should be to make the Royal Navy the Empire's navy, supported by the whole of the self-governing portions of the Empire, and not solely supported by the people of the **British** Isles, as is practically the case at the present time.

* I then went on to say - 
If such a plan can be brought about, it would be necessary for the " **British** Dominions beyond the seas" to be adequately represented at the Admiralty, and I feel sure this could be arranged on a mutually satisfactory basis.

* I do not consider the small contribution we are now proposing to make comes within the category, but as the **British** people beyond the seas increase in numbers, and as their population more closely approaches that of the motherland, is it reasonable to suppose that they will be content to intrust to the people of the United Kingdom the sole control of the Empire, and to place their destinies without demur in their hands 1 My idea is that, as we grow in power and in numbers, the time will come, although perhaps not in my day, when some plan will have to be devised under which the people of the "dominions beyond the seas" will be required to bear a portion of the burden of empire, and will have representation in the councils of the nation.

* there is difficulty in the employers obtaining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability (but this paragraph does not apply where the contract immigrant is a **British** subject either born in the United Kingdom or descended from a **British** subject there born).

* Ifa " **British** subject " includes a native of India, all I have to say is that it has been the invariable practice to limit the opera- tion of the Immigration Restriction Act to coloured persons.

* In my opinion, it is most unwise to unduly rush through a measure containing clauses which are so pregnant with the possibility of rupture, if not ruination, in connexion with our trade relations, not merely with the **British** Empire, but with the rest of the world.

* As a further proof of their desire to unite the whole of' the **British** people in one great Empire, they come down with provisions which will impose still greater barriers against the trade of Great Britain with Australia.

* The honorable member is not only engaged in supporting a Tariff wall against the products of the mother country - a thing which he would resent if she were to erect a similar wall against the importation of Australian products into Great Britain - but he is now proposing to place further disabilities upon **British** exporters to this country.

* Let us imagine for a moment that a clause of the kind were passed by the **British** Parliament for the purpose of injuring or destroying Australian imports, and carried into operation.

* in favour of **British** imports which show a proportionate decrease as compared with those from foreign countries, why is it necessary to give the same preference to another line of **British** imports which is more than holding its own ?

* If the Australian manufacturer is able to cut out foreign imports under existing circumstances, the increased protection afforded him by this " preference " should place him in a better position to annihilate **British** imports.

* But it would be a very bad thing indeed for federated Australia if South Australia were forced into the position of having to hand back the Northern Territory to the Imperial Government, with the possibility of the establishment of a chartered company there for the development of the Territory under conditions which the **British** Government would not consider at all unreasonable, namely, by the employment of black labour from India, - our own fellow subjects.

* The United States, France, &amp;c, have of course large manufactories of their own, which accounts for the comparatively small consumption of **British** goods, but the above figures show that the consumption of woollen goods, worsteds, and carpets in Australasia must already be an important factor in the demand for.

* The Fleet was welcomed by that section, not as representative of an English-speaking nation in close friendship with the **British** people, but because - so they publicly declared - we should have to look rather to America than to Great Britain as our ally, should there be difficulty with a foreign country.

* The official organs of the Labour party cannot wholly escape the charge of disloyalty to the **British** Empire.

* I submit that .1 am perfectly in order in disclaiming statements which have been at tributed to' me, and in justifying other statements which I have made regarding the desire of certain persons to have an Australian Navy, entirely independent of **British** control in time of war, and the motives underlying it.

* According to the writer - 
That is a fine, healthy, **British** sentiment- 
To half the **British** population, then, there would be nothing to lose, there might be something to gain, by the setting up of a German Government to match the German dynasty on the throne.

* This is on a par with the declarations of some members of the party in connexion with the proposal to offer a  Dreadnought  to Great Britain, when co-operation was refused on the ground that any other rule would be preferred by them to **British** rule.

* Hitherto, the **British** Navy has supplied all the defence that is necessary, and, in my opinion, a great deal more.

* For the protection and keeping open of the world's highways, we must depend almost wholly, if not entirely, on the **British** Navy.

* The Admiral in command of the **British** Fleet in the China Seas at that time was  Sir Cyprian  Bridge, who is not altogether unknown in Australia.

* They did not want the **British** Fleet to protect this country.

* If anything happened to the **British** fleet, and Australia became a prize worth taking by an enemy possessed of a fleet of vessels and a sufficiency of transports, I do not think that our little flotilla of torpedo destroyers would keep them away.

* It was stated in a cablegram published on the 28th June of this year that - 
The cruisers of the  Indomitable  class and the three unarmoured cruisers of the  Bristol  class will probably form an important Australian addition to the **British** Fleet in Australian waters, and the chief recommendation of the proposal that they shall form part of our Navy is that in time of war they will pass automatically under the control of the one authority, that of the **British** Admiralty.

* Whilst I do not think that the cruisers are actually necessary for the defence of Australia at the present time, still, if the general sentiment is- in favour of the creation of an Australian Navy, pro-  vided that it is to work in conjunction with the **British** Navy in time of war, it will be far better to devote the bulk of our expenditure to the construction of such vessels rather than to the construction of a large number of vessels of the destroyer class.

* When we employ destroyers only as adjuncts to vessels of that kind, we are simply falling into line with the **British** naval, policy, and that of other nations, and, in that respect, the ' Government are taking a course for which they are to be commended.

* I object to misleading the **British** public.

* As a part of the Empire we have a right, when there are proposals which we think may be injurious to that Empire, to express our opinions to the **British** Government.

* * I am against the introduction of indentured Chinese labour into any part of the **British** dominions.

* The fight in South Africa was for Imperial extension and supremacy, the intention being to establish there a **British** population.

* If the Ordinance be carried into effect, the Transvaal in the end will become not a **British** Colony but a Chinese Colony.

* I realize that a **British** population is needed in the Transvaal, and that we should adopt every course that will tend to establish there men and women of our own race.

* If there was one thing which characterized that man more than another, it was his **British** spirit and his determination that South Africa should be peopled by men and women of the **British** race.

* I know there is a tendency to look upon the maker of money as a person of inferior character, and what I desire to say is that, whilst Cecil Rhodes sought wealth, his idea was to use it for the purpose of securing the hinterland of South Africa, and peopling it with **British** subjects.

* He took a foremost hand in the consolidation of the De Beers mine, and) consulting with others in seeking to accomplish that consolidation, the one thing about which he fought longest was that there should be included in the constitution of the consolidation a provision that he should be permitted to use ^500,000 of their money for the purpose of extending **British** influence and power in South Africa.

* He acomplished  his purpose in that, and in so doing largely extended the influence of the **British** race in that country.

* The motion submitted by the honorable member for Bland is silent on the point, but I presume that if carried it will be communicated to the **British** Government, and I desire that there shall go from this House the expression of an unanimous opinion representing the views of the Australian people.

* I am against it, because it is a danger to the Empire and to the **British** people, and will prevent us from using that land as we might use it, for the expansion of our own race.

* I was in favour of the Transvaal war, not for the purpose of helping capitalists to exploit the country and crush down our own people, but because I believed we might use the country for the expansion of the **British** race.

* Before  Mr. Haldane  submitted his military scheme, it had been threshed out for months by the eminent soldiers of- the Empire, whose best professional advice was at the service of the **British** Government.

* I have been twenty years in command of **British** steamers, but have never received such treatment in any port I have visited before.

* -- I hope that the Committee in its wisdom will not take a course which I maintain would be opposed to **British** law.

* In India, however, no person of **British** blood is entitled to vote.

* In  1876  the **British** franchise was an abomination that would stink in the nostrils of any honest Australian politician.

* Is there one member of this House who would dare to ask Australia to accept the **British** franchise of to-day, let alone what it was thirty odd years ago?

* I ask the attention of honorable members while 1 read a few quotations from G. Barnett Smith's  History of the **British** Parliament - 
The Treasurer will riot assert that the Marquis of Hartington was not loyal to his Sovereign.

* No Act has been passed by the **British** Parliament so applying it.

* I do not wish that to happen in any **British** country.

* The " King of England" is a great title running through the history of the **British** race, and with its use I am content.

* It has been well said that if Britain loses her supremacy in the  production of pig iron, the supremacy of the **British** Navy will be endangered.

* on **British** and 3d.

* These items, I may point out, are to be found in the **British** preference column.

* in the case of- **British** goods, and 3!

* is to be charged on the **British** made candle, and the 2j-d. on the candle of the foreigner.

* In regard to candles, I fail to see how the proposed dutv will be of any verv great benefit or advantage to the **British** made candles, because I - find that, while the importation of candles from foreign countries represents .34,235 in one year, the importation from Great.

* But I believe that the forty-seven items which I have enumerated, and which will be seen by reference to progress report number 50, represent the real increases in the protective duties recommended by the Commission, and apparently adopted by the Government in reference to **British** products.

* At the proper time, I shall be prepared to support moderately reduced duties upon certain **British** imports.

* He certainly expected a big substantial preference in favour of **British** goods, and not one of 5 per cent.

* in respect of **British** imports may be a preference ; but under this Tariff we may go much further in the direction of preference, and favorable consideration to **British** goods without injuring Australian production.

* I never made any reservation that I intended, directly or indirectly, to grant any increase of the duties therein recommended in order to secure any' system of **British** preference.

* I have analyzed the list of Government in creases of duties, designed to give what is called **British** preference, and find that the items on which increased duties have' been proposed, as against foreign countries, coupled with the retention of theTariff Commission's recommendations, sofar as imports from the United Kingdom are concerned, comprise twenty-eight groups.

* The following table contains a comparison of the Tariff Commission's pro,posals with the former duties, and also shows the increases proposed by the Ministry in order to give **British** preference; - : 
No.

* I have here a second statement showing the Government increases of duty without **British** preference.

* That is to say, ona number of items the Government have proposed, increases of duty in excess of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission without granting **British** preference..

* I see no reason for that increase, even in regard to **British** imports.

* in the case of **British** imports, and to a duty of 25 per cent.

* Mixed metal and plated-ware was, under the first Tariff, dutiable at 20 per cent., a very substantial revenue duty,' which affected a very large number of items; but the rate is now 25 per cent, against **British** goods and 30 per cent, against goods from other countries.

* It appears that at the Navigation Conference  Mr. Lloyd  George gave him most of the concessions for which he asked, and, being the most benevolent gentleman with whom he had to deal, the Minister naturally comes back with the impression that  Mr. Lloyd  George is the very greatest statesman in the **British** Empire.

* When we make our representations to the **British** Government, they go to the Colonial Office.

* Does the Prime Minister think for one instant that such representations are disposed of without reference to the **British** Cabinet?

* It is the Colonial Office which supplies information and makes recommendations to the **British** Cabinet concerning such matters.

* Speaking of the Imperial Staff, which he declared to be not a staff for the **British** purposes alone, but for the forces of the whole Empire,  Mr. Haldane  said :  - 
I take it that the Prime Minister is prepared to accept the responsibility for this report because he was the Australian delegate, and as the plural number is used, the Minister of Trade and Customs seems to be included- he was now able to summarize the **British** Admiralty's decisions.

* There is little that makes Northern Australia ours except the **British** flag and the **British** fleet.

* There is nothing that will make Northern Australia ours but the **British** fleet in close proximity to our shores.

* One-fourth of the commerce of the Empire is between **British** possessions and foreign countries, and never goes near Imperial shores.

* Similarly one-fourth of the **British** trade is with foreign countries of the world.

* I cannot agree with the honorable member for New England that it is inadvisable for the Commonwealth at this period to take control of **British** New Guinea.

* It is claimed that immense advantages to Queensland would follow direct cable communication with the East and **British** and German New Guinea, especially from a trading standpoint, and it is suggested that the desire to keep this trade in the hands of the southern States has influenced the southern authorities against agreeing to cable communication.

* I have the exact figures here, and I find that the revenue in 1899 from customs duties on **British** and foreign products, and from excise, amounted to 577,098 ; and from Inter-State duties to 256,060.

* In 1900 the revenue from customs and excise duties was 944,746, or 696,746 from duties on **British** and foreign goods and excise, and 275,000 from duties on Inter-State imports.

* The total Inter-State duties for 1900 have not been officially published, but it is fair to take them at 275,000, since the increase in **British** and foreign imports for same year was about 90,000.

* The revenue from **British** and foreign imports and excise in 1900 was 658,716, not including Inter-State duties.

* My estimate works out in this way : the revenue from **British** and foreign imports in 1900 was only 3 13s.

* As the Federal Government collects no duty except on **British** and foreign imports, only the revenue from these imports should have been taken into account in comparing the rate of taxation per head under the old system and the new.

* The first mentioned sum refers to **British** and foreign goods only.

* What I want to show is that the Treasurer is increasing and not diminishing the taxation on the **British** and foreign imports.

* The revenue from duties upon **British** and foreign imports which have been increased will amount to 86,026, and excise duties - taking the Treasurer's own estimate for this - to 111,727, or 359,649 in all.

* **British** and Foreign Household Commodities  hitherto  imported Free into Western Australia, hut  how  taxed hy the Commonwealth - 
I bow at once to your ruling,  Mr. Speaker,  but I think my remark can be connected  with the question before the chair.

* Here is a list of **British** and foreign commodities, used in mining and other industries, which hitherto have been admitted free into 
- Then a mistake has been made in the Minister's "Comparative Tariff."

* I come now to the **British** and foreign commodities, upon which this beneficent Government, which was to do so much for Australia, has actually increased the duties.

* Almost the whole of the jellies and preserves which enter Western Australia are **British** and foreign.

* According to the document which I have in my hand, they are **British** and foreign produce, and produce of other States is given separately.

* In 1900 Western Australia imported 9,343 worth of boots and shoes of **British** and foreign make, and 5,189 worth of Australian make.

* Under the increased duties of the Federal Tariff) the **British** and foreign imports of boots and shoes will yield .19,233.

* But there is a much more serious question to be faced, and the delay on the part of the English authorities in dealing with it has cost the **British** Government thousands of pounds.

* So far as I am aware, there has been no breach of the neutrality regulations by **British** citizens going from Australia, and the Minister of Trade and Customs informs me that every step has been taken to guard against any breach of the character indicated.

* youngest, except one, of the self-governing dominions of the **British** Empire - in the Commonwealth of Australia, which it was the proud boast of the present PostmasterGeneral had included as the first words in its Constitution the statement that, " We, the people of the States of Australia, agree to federate."

* The people themselves decided to do this, and then a Government of this young Commonwealth, having the control of the representative Chamber, communicate with the **British** Government and ask them if in their view the word "Emperor" should be put on our first coins.

* This is a young nation, which is destined to become great, and in the future the **British** Empire will be stronger just in proportion to the independence which is shown by the young nations included in it.

* Did the Supreme Court then next request the **British** Consul at Yokohama to take the evidence?

* There are, in Australia, only 47,000 Asiatics, including Asiatics who are **British** subjects ; and the number qualifying for old-age pensions - assuming that they do so at the same rate as the rest of the population - would be one-sixtieth of that total, which would reduce the possibles to about 809.

* There is no doubt that while in a few instances they do give a preference to the goods of the United Kingdom, the net result of the change in our treatment of **British** goods under the new Tariff as against the old one is to impose a disability upon them.

* to represent the differenece between what foreign goods will be required to pay as against **British** goods.

* But if we are to institute a proper comparison we ought to set against that alleged saving the higher duties which are levied upon **British** goods under the new Tariff.

* was extended to candles of **British** origin.

* If we allow that 1,  300,000  - the Treasurer states that it may grow to  1,500,000  - represents the difference between the duty which will be payable upon **British** imports as compared with the amount which the foreigners will have to pay upon imports of the same value, we must set against that amount the increased duties which reduce that advantage, and which in my opinion remove every rag of preference that is granted under the Tariff.

* upon **British** goods, the saving to Great 
The Minister will have to show that it is not false.

* I can see difficulties and dangers in front of the **British** Empire, if it trusts for its union to the business bargaining of its various portions.

* But had there been a bargain preference between the two, the intermediate Tariff offered to Italy and to Germany would reduce the **British** preference, in return for which Great Britain had given concessions, and the **British** Government and Parliament would raise strong objection to it, while the Canadian Parliament would probably resent interference.

* We have seen the effect of preference on **British** trade in Canada.

* Although Great Britain's trade with Canada has increased, so has the trade of foreign countries with the Dominion, and the proportion of trade done by Great Britain is no better now than it was before **British** goods were given preference.

* It may be very unpleasant to have to quote these opinions, and I can assure honorable members it gives me no pleasure to quote anything showing a decline of **British** trade.

* I will give a quotation which only reached this State yesterday, regarding **British** manufactures in France.

* The  Times  weekly edition of April 1 9 last says - 

 Mr. Warburton, our Consul in La Rochelle gives a gloomy account in his last report on his district of the trade there in **British** manufactured goods, which he describes as a negligable  quantity.

* This is the case now in nearly all instances in which **British** manufactures still find a market in France.

* Hence **British** manufactured goods are being less sold year by year, and fashion has much to do with those which still hold their ground, and there is not much chance of a change for the better, as there is no .probability of a reduction in the present high duties.

* The United States of America continue to beat **British** exporters out of the field in light agricultural implements, shop tools, and lathes, in spite of the higher wages they pay for labour and the greater distance they have to send their goods.

* He advises **British** merchants to look further afield than France, for home production there is now protected to such an extent that former customers are now competitors in foreign markets.

* From St. Nazaire also the report is that coal is the only thoroughly satisfactory trade left with that part of France, for nearly every other outlet for **British** goods is being slowly but surely closed by the ever increasing customs Tariff.

* But a more conspicuous and important illustration of the recognition, of protective duties by the **British** Government is found in the fact that recently the Indian Legislature passed laws for the imposition of duties on imported sugar as.

* The writer mentioned that the American .manufacturers had already commenced to send agents along that railway across Asia and into the centre of Siberia in search of outlets for American trade and commerce ; but he pointed out at the same time that not a single commercial agent from any **British** community had been there.

* Sir, how  can we escape our obligation in respect of Imperial defence  1  How can we stand by and allow the **British** taxpayer to incur the heavy expenditure of 26,000,000 a year in maintaining the fleet for the defence of the Empire, without having a share in that expenditure  1  I am quite sure my honorable and learned friend, when he considers the matter, will realize what we owe to the old country ; and will admit that our obligations cannot be avoided.

* Whilst not minimising or depreciating the value of military defence, I desire to emphasize of the transcendent importance of naval defence to Australia, and to make some suggestions f  for the  consideration of the Government I have pointed out that although the **British** taxpayer is burdened to the extent of 26,000,000 per annum for the maintenance of the fleet- - 
It is 26,0.00,000 according to the figures I  recently saw in the  Times,  and yet we, the people of Australia, are called upon to pay, or offered to pay towards the maintenance of the fleet, the  insignificent  sum of.

* But it was then thought that the Australian auxiliary fleet, although retained under the supreme command of the **British** Admiralty, would be available afterwards for the employment of Australian seamen.

* One of the arguments was that Australian seamen would be able to find employment, through that fleet, in the **British** fleet ; that expectation has not yet been realized, and whilst the system of contributing towards the support of the Imperial fleet has no doubt had many advantages, and shows our sympathy with the Imperial .

* There, a branch of the naval reserve has been established, and seafaring men of the Newfoundland population have been organized locally, and have afterwards been given experience on board some of the **British** cruisers.

* It had been gradually dawning on us, and we were led to believe that we were on the eve of the realization of tha't splendid scheme of a cable on all **British** territory, a cable supported not by private companies, but belonging partly to the Imperial Government, and partly to the new Commonwealth and the Dominion of Canada.

* It has been conceded by all that if Britain goes down, we must go down, and that if the **British** Navy loses its power we cannot stand.

* Every man desires to preserve, as far as he can, the bonds of kinship and affection, not only with the **British** people, but with those of America and others of our own race in every part of the world.

* The proposal now before us is to give 200,000 as a contribution or tribute to the **British** Navy.

* Long before there was revolution in America,  the **British** officers were allowed to do as they liked in the colonial days, and one officer in Boston told a citizen that he would force the Stamp Act down his throat with the sword's point.

* - I do not think that any one will accuse me of being disloyal to the **British** Empire, and I feel that I have as much loyalty in my composition as has any other subject of the Empire.

* It invites all citizens of South Australia to be present to express their opinion upon the policy which is now being carried out by the **British** Government in respect to the war in South Africa.

* Meanwhile the issue of the Proclamation bringing the Papua Act into force, and creating **British** New Guinea a territory of the Commonwealth, has been deferred until new ordinances are ready for enactment.

* It has long been our boast as Britishers - as members of the **British** Empire - that our courts of justice may be relied on as absolutely free from bias either to one side or the other.

* The honorable member for North Sydney has on many occasions rendered signal service, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the Empire, but he never rendered a more signal service that he did in submitting his amendment upon the Contract Immigrants Bill providing for the exemption from some of its provisions of **British** labourers introduced under contract.

* I am afraid that I shall be compelled to quote the honorable gentleman's own utterances - not the utterances of some designing oppositionist who desires to secure the Minister's position - to show how difficult it is to understand why an honorable gentleman, who is so oval : and so **British**, should refuse to accept an amendment exempting articles produced in Great Britain from the operation of the dumping provisions of this Bill.

* The honorable member for North Sydney urged in support of the amendment that **British** manufacturers should be exempt from these dumping provisions in just the same way that labour from Great Britain nas been exempted from the provisions of the Contract Immigrants Act.

* The honorable member for Melbourne Ports accepted the amendment which was moved on the Contract Immigrants Bill, affecting contract **British** labour, and we now ask the honorable member and other honorable members opposite to prove their  bona fides  as citizens of the Empire, by agreeing to exempt from these dumping provisions the products of **British** manufacturers.

* The amendment now before the Committee is, in my opinion, the strongest yet presented in this Chamber to test the loyalty and **British** instincts of those who call themselves preferential traders.

* For the purposes of this Act, implements of **British** manufacture shall be deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand, and the importers of such implements shall be deemed to be manufacturers thereof in New Zealand.

* Lecture delivered by the Honorable  Sir William  J. Lyne, K.C.M.G., Minister for Trade and Customs, Commonwealth of Australia, before the **British** Empire League, Sydney, in the Royal Society's rooms, 25th January, 1904.

* I repeat that we are vitally interested in the prosperity and prestige of the great centre of the **British** Empire, and if there is anything we may contribute to its maintenance and progress, so much will it be to our lasting and permanent advantage, apart altogether from those feelings of sentiment and patriotism which, contrary to the opinions expressed by certain ill-natured and ill-informed critics, inspire the hopes and ambitions of the Australian people.

* There are certain and many articles, owing to a limited demand, and in the absence of specially skilled labour, which for many years to come we are not likely to be able to produce here with any possible success, and it is the trade in these articles which we hope, by the adoption of  Mr. Chamberlain's  proposal, will be restored to the hands of **British** manufacturers and **British** workmen.

* The right side, the loyal side, the **British** side.

* The Minister of Trade and Customs admits the strong position which **British** products hold in comparison with our own; and he has expressed a desire that the former should be allowed to come in, and suggested that the Tariff would prove a ready machine for the adoption of Imperial reciprocity.

* Now, however, by means of this Bill, the honorable gentleman seeks to erect a stone wall against those **British** products.

* If New" Zealand, which is in the van of progressive and protective legislation, could make an exemption in favour of **British** products, we surely may follow that example.

* The New Zealand Act provides that implements of **British** manu.facture shall be deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand - that the importer shall be deemed to be the manufacturer.

* The importations of **British** steam-engines in 1898 represented -164,000, as compared with ,411,000 worth in 1901,; while the importations of other machinery in 1898 represented ,787,000, as compared with ,1,025,000 worth in 1901.

* Now is the golden opportunity; we do not want lip loyalty, but some practical exemption in favour of **British** products.

* What the Attorney-General means by  ' ' dumping " can never take place in connexion with **British** products, though the definition by the Minister of Trade and Customs would appear to embrace all trades.

* Under its operation the members of the crew of any **British** vessel would be required to carry birth, certificates to pro  to  that they were of **British** origin.

* I hold that I am not departing from any plank of the Labour platform by refusing to extend this preference to **British** seamen.

* Nothing could be imagined more repugnant to the spirit of **British** liberty and toleration than to permit any kind of labour organization to use a Court of law as the instrument for offering to those who differ from it the alternative of joining or being dismissed.

* as against **British** imports and of 2d.

* I would remind the Committee that there was a Chancellor of the Exchequer in a **British** Government who lost his office as the result of proposing a much smaller tax upon matches than that' under consideration.

* 12, page 128, of the  Laws and Ordinances of **British** New Guinea - 
I know that the Administrator has a good many difficulties to encounter, though some of them have done very good work.

* I find on reference to the report, that in the year 1902-3 the number of murders committed  in  **British** New Guinea was 460 more than in the previous year - an increase of between 30 and 40 per cent.

* Supply,  reading a letter from a former resident of **British** New Guinea - a gentleman who was held in very high esteem both there and in Queensland - I refer to the late  Mr. J.  P. Cusack, who was Mining Surveyor at Woodlark Island.

* It is probable enough, though, that the Executive Councillors in Port Moresby, who constitute a " happy family " in the remotest corner of the Possession, and who are out of touch with the bulk of the white inhabitants of **British** New Guinea, knew all about the proposed Liquor Prohibition Bill.

* What our branch desires is that your party will use its efforts to safeguard the interests of white workers here in any legislation that might be brought before the Federal Houses dealing with New Guinea, and if the Labour Party have any doubts as to how any proposed measures would affect the workers here, that it will endeavour to have such measures deferred until such times as it can gather information from **British** New Guinea.

* That letter, I think, conveys a fair impression of the conditions which obtain in **British** New Guinea.

* I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that within the last few days a foreign ship has entered an inter-State port with its seals of stores broken, contrary to the Federal Customs Act, and that such ship has been allowed to clear that port without giving a guarantee to answer the charge, whilst a **British** ship for a similar offence was refused clearance and detained in port ?

* Will the Minister see that the federal law is enforced equally against foreign and **British** ships ?

* When a man has been in training; in Great Britain for three or four  years, he is not allowed, unless under exceptional circumstances, to buy his release ; and the result is that the men in the **British** Navy are the most highly-skilled of gunners.

* I have no desire to discuss at this stage the Naval Agreement Act, but I am surprised that the Minister, after expressing his appreciation of the protection afforded us by the **British** Navy, was not prepared to say that the Ministry had determined to refrain from asking Parliament to repeal the Naval Agreement Act.

* While our annual contribution of 200,000 to the **British** Navy can be defended, I am not prepared to say that the withdrawal of that contribution would inflict any serious injury on the Navy or lead to Australia losing its protection.

* I believe that the **British** Government were prepared to agree to the cancellation of the Naval Agreement because they thought that the Prime Minister on returning to Australia would formulate a scheme of naval and military defence of much greater proportions than the present one, and requiring an infinitely larger expenditure.

* In my opinion, the **British** Government believe that if the Agreement were cancelled, the money now paid under it to the **British** Navy would be devoted by Australia to a more comprehensive scheme of naval and military defence.

* The honorable member for Maranoa gave us an illustration from his own experience of the advantages of discipline, and spoke of the **British** Tommy Atkins as the best fighting man in the world.

* The **British** money-lender is not a philanthropist, and is not likely to invest his capital in anything which does not promise him reasonable security.

* On dutiable goods not the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, or not imported direct in **British** ships -  does not mean that foreign goods, imported in **British** ships, shall not be liable to the higher impost ?

* - I understand that each column must be considered by itself, and it seems to me that, if they are treated as separate and distinct, no duty is provided for goods the produce or manufacture of some country other than Great Britain imported in **British** ships.

* (**British**) free, (other)  ad valorem, 10  per cent.

* That would be merely elementary **British** justice.

* The Minister, when he takes action against a reputable firm, should give it every opportunity to obtain **British** justice; but this is apparently denied only to those who have dealings with the Customs Department.

* When a respectable, firm is held up in this manner, it is time that some one made his voice heard in the interests of fair play and **British** justice.

* I congratulate the Minister on the splendid loyalty of his followers when they will permit him to use language such as he has employed in reply to a plain demand for **British** justice.

* Rather than "stick up" trade in this fashion - a fashion which certainly denies **British** "justice to those carrying on business operations - it would be better for the Minister to bring in an antidumping Bill, and to shut ut) our ports entirely.

* They deserve nothing better if that be the case ; but before we destroy a firm's  reputation  in this way we ought to give them a chance to be heard, and to show in a **British** Court of justice that they have not done the things imputed to them.

* I point out also that any Chinese born in Hong Kong or at Wai-hai-wei and any kanaka born in **British** New Guinea or in the Solomon Islands, which are **British** territory, will also be entitled to a vote under this clause if no alteration is made in clause 4.

* Has the Prime Minister any official information about the action of German officials towards **British** miners in Papua, reported in to-day's newspapers, and will he inform' the House if any arrangement has teen made by his Depart-, ment for the survey of the boundary line between German and **British** New Guinea?

* The right honorable member put his assumption in a variety of forms, from any one of which honorable members might have believed, and have been justified in believing, that the policy of the **British** Government as expressed by  Mr. Chamberlain,  and accepted by us, stopped short of that goal; but 1 say once and for all, that if it had stopped short of that goal it would have had no endorsement from this Government.

* We have been asked by that member of the **British** Government who is peculiarly associated with the outlying parts of the Empire in which we reside to adopt a certain course and to make that course as effective as we choose.

* We have to remember that this is not the first occasion on which the Australian colonies have been compelled to rely on representations made for them by the **British** Government.

* I happened, however, to have some official' connexion with the continuous efforts made by all the colonies in concert - the eastern colonies particularly - with a view to obtain, by the influence of the **British** Government the cessation of the transport of these criminals.

* Ultimately, after 1887, owing wholly and solely to the action of the **British** Government undertaken at the request of Australia, this immigration to New Caledonia was entirely prohibited.

* While there  was no possibility of action on our part, we found that the **British** Government had full sympathy with our aims.

* Consequently when  Mr. Chamberlain  and the **British** Government tell us that they appreciate the motives which lead the people of Australia to be resolved in their determination to prohibit the entrance of coloured aliens, and that they, while advising and requesting that a certain course be followed, are willing that this courseshall  be followed to any extent in order to make it effective, we have every reason to rely on our previous experience.

* That has been our experience on previous occasions, much, as I happen to know, to the distaste of high officials through whom the **British** Government were bound to express themselves.

* Great obstacles were thrown in the way of the **British** Government on the occasion to .

* But the **British** Government insisted on these recalcitrant officials listening to the voice of Australia at a time when that voice was much weaker than it is to-day.

* When we were without possibility of taking legislative steps, the **British** Government adopted the necessary action, by means of which the exclusion of these immigrants was secured from New Caledonia, which was rendered a dependency of which France herself might be proud, and to which we can look without the grave apprehensions entertained from 1880 to 1883.

* We are sending the measure home with the assurance that the **British** Government, having requested that this course shall be followed, have incurred a responsibility to Australia that they will not be slow to discharge - a responsibility which, I believe, the **British** Government will accept to the full and discharge to the full - the responsibility of seeing that this measure is so backed up and supported by diplomatic representations that its effectiveness will be assisted by operations in other directions, though they are not made public nor placed on the face of any statute, but which nevertheless will have the effect of cutting off the stream of supply at the source.

* That can certainly be done in relation to **British** India, from whence, at the wish of the Imperial Government, the influx of coolies can be altogether stopped.

* A number of them probably come from beyond **British** borders.

* After all, the **British** Empire itself arid all its parts depend for their unity and guarantee of freedom upon the Navy.

* owe to naval power and to the **British** flag our freedom in and ownership of this territory, the power to retain it, the whole of our political liberties and social standards.

* The **British** Navy is a proud and progressive service, not content to rely upon its past laurels, unequalled as they are, but pushing insistently forward,, keeping in its iron grip the priority it has held for centuries.

* The pressure upon the nerve, courage, and capacity of each unit and upon every man in the **British** marine is far higher now than it has ever been, and still tends to increase with every one of the marvellous advances which science is making.

* At the very outset of the recent Colonial Conference in London, the Prime Minister of Great Britain met us with the frank avowal that the **British** Government preferred no claim for .money in relation to naval defence, and went on to add the extremely pregnant statement that the control of naval defence and foreign affairs must always go together.

* In order to mark the change which has come over the policy of **British** Governments in regard, first of all, to our political relations to the defence problem, and next in regard to the measure of defence which falls to our lot, allow me for a moment to refer to a few incidents in our own history.

* Consequently, when, in 1905, Admiral Fanshawe delivered several speeches, and one in particular, in which he pointed out the insufficiency of our contribution, I took occasion in August of that year to write to the **British** Government a despatch challenging his contentions.

* No exception was taken to the existence of a Naval Agreement between the **British** Government and ourselves; on the contrary, that was postulated.

* I contended that the monetary standard was not the most acceptable for an Australian contribution, and that some other form of co-operation was necessary ; that, in its present form, the Agreement was not so popular as it ought to be, considering the great popularity of the **British** Navy - that, in short, the Agreement was not satisfactory to any one, and had been accepted only until a better means of united action could be devised.

* But shortly before the Colonial Conference opened, a. debate occurred in the House of Commons, in which a speech by  Mr. Balfour,  followed by its indorsement on behalf of the present Government, exhibited an entire change of front on the part of the **British** Parliament, so far as the political side of this question is concerned.

* It was then intimated in the clearest terms that so far as the **British** Parliament was concerned it would make no further demands of any kind upon us in connexion with Imperial Naval Defence.

* At our subsequent meetings, Lord Tweedmouth, who represents the Admiralty in the Government, plainly said - 
Speaking for Great Britain and the **British** Government, we are responsible.

* The consistency of these with the axiom of the head of the **British** Government is still to seek.

* That is to say, we were to place confidence in the **British** Board of Admiralty and in the present **British** Government for the future safety of the country.

* He said - 
These three very important conditions were followed by the statement that the **British** Government were responsible for the defence of the Empire, that they wanted us to help them in that defence, but only on the terms mentioned.

* Again, he said - 
So long as the possession of unity of command and direction of the Fleet is maintained they -  meaning the **British** Government -  are ready to consider a modification of the existing arrangements to meet the views of the various Colonies.

* The whole defence of the sea and its control is to be a matter for the **British** Government and the **British** Navy.

* The old doctrine, so far as I understand it, appeared to be that the strength of the Mother Country was to be asserted bv the presence in every important sea of a separate fleet to " patrol its waters and to maintain **British** interests against attack, so that wherever difficulty arose there would be a fleet in that particular portion of the globe prepared for duty.

* I have here a rough summary of the opinions which I ventured to express in London outside the Conference, adding the wishes of the **British** Government and of the Admiralty in.

* the sea-board, might be kept in touch with the **British** Navy.

* After quoting what Lord Tweed1-  mouth had said about the value to the **British** Squadron of submersibles or submarines and destroyers in these waters, I went on to insist that these submersibles and destroyers, built, manned, and maintained at the sole expense of the Commonwealth, must remain under the control of the Government.

* larger fleets with larger opportunities, and above all with those of the greatest of maritime powers, the **British** Navy.

* In everything else, they would be part of the **British** Navy, the officers and men being simply seconded for fixed terms for service under our general control ; but in every other respect indistinguishable from the men in the Imperial Squadrons here or elsewhere.

* I took the opportunity, on my own personal responsibility, of pressing that upon the Admiralty and upon the **British** Government as, at all events, one means by which our flotilla might be kept entirely up to date, its Australian character maintained, and the control of the Commonwealth Government asserted.

* It would then be practi- cally a branch of the **British** Fleet, though under the Commonwealth, so far as political control was concerned.

* It would, perhaps, be less effectively employed apart, but, whatever it did, would help the **British** Squadron and assist to protect this part of the Empire.

* The Royal Navy could lose nothing by the existence of a special force, created and maintained at our expense, and not at that of the **British** taxpayer.

* By its means we can make a real addition to the **British** Navy.

* In fact, it would be part of the **British** Navy.

* First there is the **British** Squadron for which we make a contribution in money.

* contribute anything to the **British** Navy?

* The Royal Navy has the pick of **British** seamen.

* Lord Tweedmouth, speaking on behalf of the **British** Government, was most generous, and Ministers have confidence that the proposals now put forward by the Commonwealth in consonance with his suggestion will be adopted upon the advice of the Admiralty.

* So long as we form a part of the **British** Empire - and I hope that we shall never be anything else - there is no such necessity laid upon us in Australia.

* The very essence of the fighting quality of the **British** Army - indeed, of nearly every European army - is to be found in the local ideals which its various branches have established for themselves - in the healthy rivalry that is begotten by different systems, different organizations, and different localities and different regiments.

* I think that every honorable member will agree that on occasions of this sort it would not be wise to take any step which would accentuate the troubles of the Empire, but, with the utmost desire to preserve peace between the nations, it seems to me to be necessary, in the face of an outrage such as that against which we are now protesting, to show that the **British** people resent such action, and are determined to continue a firm attitude in regard to it.

* I desire to give my meed of con gratulation to the Prime Minister, because of the conclusion of the negotiations for reciprocity with **British** South Africa.

* I very much doubt whether the **British** Government, if they knew the seriousness of the question to us, would pay so much attention to the wishes of Japan as some honorable members seem to think they are likely to do.

* The **British** Government are naturally desirous of securing the friendship of the Ameer of Afghanistan, and it is feared that any act of this kind might possibly offend the susceptibilities of the Japanese people.

* To the majority of the people of the **British** Isles, I believe that the friendship of Australia is ever so much more important than is the friendship of Japan or Afghanistan.

* The **British** Parliament, in conferring upon us the Constitution which we at present enjoy, gave the Commonwealth the right to legislate upon matters of immigration and emigration: I have looked up the debates which took place upon the Commonwealth Bill in the Imperial.

* This points to the fact that the **British** Government expected us to pass some such restrictive legislation.

* If the **British** Government realize the seriousness of the position, I feel sure that they will stand by us irrespective of the consequences.

* Not long ago the Commonwealth sent troops to South Africa to fight shoulder to shoulder with the **British** troops.

* He charged members of the Opposition with having engaged in a crusade for the vilification of Australia, and declared that thev were responsible for the criticisms, whether fair or unfair - and some of them, I admit, are unfair - which have appeared in the **British** press concerning our conditions and the administration of our laws.

* reply to the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, he only indicated definitely that he intended to improve the condition of the **British** people - so far as Australia was concerned - by adding to the exclusion of **British** citizens, the exclusion of **British** goods by means of an increased measure of protection.

* If, on the contrary, advantage were taken of that power to subject **British** immigrants to an examination in  language of which they knew nothing, it would be an undoubted straining of the intention of Parliament, and would very properly call for animadversion, both from members of.

* And yet Australia - a **British** community - is enforcing the contract provisions in this Act against Britishers, even in circumstances in which it was said when the Bill was before us that there would be no necessity to do so.

* The sooner we remove the impression that a community of **British** people, which is indebted to Great Britain for the great gift of the Continent of Australia, and many of the liberties it enjoys, places restrictions in the way of honest citizens of the Empire coming to Australia to accept honest employment, and not with the intention of forcing down wages, or of interfering with an industrial dispute, the better for the Commonwealth.

* I trust that at an early date we shall see the worst features of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act removed from our statute-book, and a different opinion created throughout the **British** Empire from that which at present exists in regard to our immigration laws.

* The **British** forces in India must always be maintained at a strength bearing a certain, relation to the number of native troops, and whilst we should not be able to obtain **British** soldiers from India we should have no difficulty in securing any number of Indian troops to assist us.

* The honorable member for Perth, who has referred to the non-fighting capacity of lascars, will probably remember that when the European population of Pekin was beleaguered in the **British** Legation, at the time of the Chinese Rebellion, the first **British** troops to fight their way to their assistance were the Sikhs.

* I was informed a few days ago that patriotic associations are now being formed in India, with a view to put the question to the **British** Government - " Are you going to stand entirely with your 4,000,000 of **British** subjects in Australia, or to have some .

* regard for the 400,000,000 **British** subjects in India?"

* Presumably, yes, as there is only one ship named  Powerful  in the **British** Navy.

* It is urged that we cannotexpect Great Britainto give us any preference, in view of our " Highwall Tariff " - that we continually shut out **British** manufactures, extending them no preference whatever, and that therefore we have no right to look for any concessions or help from Great Britain.

* I have here a return prepared by the Board of Trade, and based on the latest Custom House reports of Great Britain, showing "the estimated average  ad valorem  equivalent import duties levied by the undermentioned countries on the principal articles of **British** export from Great Britain.

* What I am quoting from is a table showing the "estimated average  ad valorem  equivalent import duties levied by the undermentioned countries on the principle articles of **British** export from the United Kingdom."

* The returns show that from **British** possessions in 1902 there wasimported 2,534,286 worth of butter, while from foreign countries there was imported no less than 17,992,404 worth.

* I also notice with pleasure that the **British** Government, in replying to the Premier of New Zealand, acknowledges that that colony and the Commonwealth of Australia are quite within their rights when they enter these protests.

* His working year contained about 15 per cent, more working hours than the **British** workman's, and he seldom went on strike.

* I hold that this has to do with Australian and **British** workmen, inasmuch as it lowers the standard of living, and is degrading to all white labour.

* If they 'are sent to England, and made up into garments, those garments come out here at a duty qf  35  per cent.-- the preferential rate allowed for **British** goods.

* It is a thing foreign to the genius of the **British** people.

* I do not know that  Senator Playford  would be selected to control the **British** Army.

* I  should like to point out, sir, that you allowed the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne this afternoon to talk for an hour on such matters of general policy as the **British** Fleet, and our system of coastal defence.

* possible to secure, at a very small rate of pay, non-commissioned officers who are among the best soldiers in the **British** Army..

* The idea was that a certain number of Australian officers should go to the mother country to be attached to the **British** Forces, and that a certain number of **BritisH** officers should be sent out in exchange, to be attached to our Forces.

* Our officers, upon being attached to the Imperial Army, would acquire greater knowledge and experience, and the **British** officers coming here would assist very much to promote the efficiency of our Forces.

* Yes, I quite agree withthe honorable and learned member, and I think that the other feature of the proposal that **British**" officers should be attached to our Forces is also an excellent one.

* I think it will be an excellent thing for our officers to be attached for a short period to the **British** Forces in India or at Home.

* The honorable andlearned member for Northern Melbourne seems to have a perfect craze with reference to the **British** Navy.

* After the views which have been expressed by the honorable and learned member upon other subjects I can understand the peculiar trend of his thoughts, but I should like to ask why he should desire to treat the **British** Navy in a worse manner than he would deal with the meanest man in his employment.

* The extraordinary thing is that we not only have the **British** squadron in these seas to protect us, but the whole of the vast and magnificent naval strength of Great Britain - every man and every gun - is pledged to our defence.

* But now he sits like a well-fed horse in the shafts, and takes no notice of any observation with regard to the discontinuance of our contribution to the **British** Navy.

* The Imperial Government spend 35,000,000 annually upon the **British** Navy, which guarantees the integrity of every inch of the **British** Empire, including Australia, and a contribution of 200,000 towards such an immense outlay is so contemptible that all the diplomacy and conferences and Acts of Parliament which have been associated with the transaction represent, I think, the worst phase of English statesmanship - not because we do not owe the money, or that the service rendered is not fully worth it, but because the contribution is a mere farce, if it is to be regarded as a fair payment for services rendered.

* That is the spirit which makes the Empire strong, and I trust that, whatever may be our political views, we shall never forget the marvellous service which the **British** people, the **British** fleet, and the **British** flag render to the democracy of Australia.

* It was not my intention to take part in this debate; but I felt that I could not allow the remarks made by the honorable member for Corangamite, in reference to the **British** Medical Association, to' pass without contrasting some of the actions of that body with those of the unions to which the honorable member is opposed.

* New South Wales branch of the **British** Medical Association is a close corporation, and has been guilty of acts that no union of workers would ever commit.

* It offered them the highest rates paid by any friendly society in the State, but the edict went forth from the local branch of the **British** Medical Association that no member of it should take office in any branch of the Australian Natives' Association unless he was prepared to run the risk of being ostracised.

* With a desire for peace, I, with other members of the committee of the Australian Natives' Association, had two or three conferences with representatives of this socalled branch of the **British** Medical Association.

* A. doctor who acts for any branch of the Australian Natives' Association is not permitted to have a consultation with a member of the Sydney branch of the **British** Medical Association.

* If a member of the Sydney branch of the **British** Medical Association acts as the medical officer of any branch of the Australian Natives' Association the whole force of the medical society is brought to bear to crush him.

* As president of the Australian Natives' Association, I had to deal with the **British** Medical Association, and on retiring from office left my successor to combat with them.

* The Australian Natives' Association in New South Wales has been able, notwithstanding the efforts of this body, to secure medical attendance for its members, and is gradually, but", surely, working in the direction of securing the passing of a State law that will compel even members of the **British** Medical Association to- consult with fellow members of their profession when life is in danger.

* Men are not compelled to join workers' unions, although members of the medical profession in New South Wales are compelled to conform to the rules of the local branch of the **British** Medical Association, or run the risk of being unable to secure a practice.

* I recognise that any Government, in making such a change, would have to face the differentiation from the **British** system ; but the proposals of the Committee were so framed that the differentiation would be as small as possible.

* The- difficulties of calculation, and of bringing the two systems into line in commerce, were minimised by the recommenda-tion of the Committee to fix the florin as the standard, and to make the Australian sovereign, if minted under such a system, of the exact value of the **British** sovereign.

* I do not agree with the honorable member for Wentworth in his desire to retain the **British** silver coinage here.

* I understood the Treasurer to say that the **British** coin's would still circulate here, and, .

* Does the Treasurer think that the **British** shilling will be a current coin here ?

* I would point out that if our silver currency is depreciated when it leaves these shores, the **British** silver currency will be equally depreciated when it reaches these shores.

* I do not say that people would have any great interest in bringing it here, but it would be of great interest to the **British** Mint if they could land 100,000 worth here, for they would take back 60,000 sovereigns more for it than it cost.

* I should have been sorry if he had gone so far as to ask the **British** Mint to coin silver without the authority of this Parliament.

* A certain number of these may be naturalized, and a certain number may have been **British** subjects before they came here.

* It was "in 1855 that the first Legislative Council of Victoria passed the first legislation in this hemisphere for the exclusion of the Chinese, and I had the honour of being a member of the Government which, in 1883, conveyed, without any qualification or reservation, its intimation to the **British** Government of the day that, much as we appreciated the difficulties under which they had been placed by all that followed from the unhappy tragedy of Phoenix Park, no one of the men connected with that tragedy, even if under the shelter of the law as informers, should be permitted to land in this country.

* My right honorable and learned friend drew the Bill, and I drafted the declaration for submission to our colleagues, which was wired to the **British** Government.

* That was a plain, frank, and quite friendly request on behalf of the **British** Government to the Australian colonies, that in excluding those whom they wished to exclude they should adopt a certain course.

* The **British** Union Jack is quite sufficient for me, and I think it ought to be sufficient on the mail steamers.

* We may dispute about the proportion, but we cannot deny that the security of Australia is based upon the  dominant  position of the **British** Navy.

* the **British** fleet were driven from these seas the security of Australia would be gone, and the opportunities of Anglo-Saxon growth here in instant danger of curtailment.

* Upon the maintenance of the supremacy of the **British** Navy rests the whole security of Australia.

* His Excellency  the' present Admiral on the Australian Station has submitted to the Defence Department proposals for amended regulations which will enable Australians  cow  passing through their course of training on the Squadron in these seas to proceed for a fixed period to the great ships or torpedo boats and destroyers on the coast of England, as well as to the **British** Naval training schools.

* I refer to the recent alterations in the ship-building programme of the **British** Government, coupled with the intimation of the new ship-building programme of Germany.

* The protection of our ports and coasts will be for the benefit, not only of Australian, but of **British** shipping.

* As I have stated already, the **British** Navy upon the high seas extends to us a protective power which no effort of ours could hope to rival.

* There is the barrier to **British** trade; not to the same extent as the Ministry desired - thanks to the Opposition.

* There was a time, for thirty years, when the protectionists called us foreign traders, because they wanted to shut out the **British** manufactures, which, in the old days, competed seriously with Australian industries.

* Of course, the **British** Government are not so silly as to announce that they will treat the Commonwealth in the same way as France and Germany; that would burst the whole balloon.

* The Tory party of Great Britain will ask that the people of the **British** household, who pay the **British** taxes, shall have some preference against men in these new lands who tax **British** industry.

* The moment, however, that the Union Jack is borne into these Australian seas we become American, and not **British**.

* We apply American laws to the **British** flag.

* If the Government really believe that preferential trade will open up great avenues to farming enterprise, if they really believe that we shall have tens of millions of bushels of wheat to sell to the people of Great Britain behind the preferential barricade, this is not the time to penalize the **British** people at every point, by proscribing their immigrants, proscribing their shipping, and discarding their mail services.

* byandby,/but an the meantime thB Government, by its actions, is sending the knife right into the unity of the **British** Empire.

* It is obvious that if we annoyed France or any other country, and caused her to retaliate because we differentiated between her and New Zealand, the effect would be the same if we differentiated between her and the whole of the **British** Empire.

* If England says to Australia, or to New Zealand, " We shall allow your butter to enter our market at lower rates than will be imposed on Danish or Russian butter, because our peoples are kith and kin," the splendid underlying sentiment will be readily understood; but  if  the **British** manufacturers who must have a market for their goods on the one hand, and the Danish ' and Russian producers who would otherwise be ruined on the other, compelled their respective Governments to enter into a mutually suitable arrangement, the Imperialist idea would be shattered.

* According to a recent conversation I had with a gentleman from the New Hebrides, the position of the **British** settlers in the group is anything but satisfactory.

* The **British** settlers are placed at a distinct disadvantage in comparison with the French settlers.

* Australia, while giving a mail subsidy and professing to assist the **British** settlers, excludes from her market practically everything which thev produce.

* I have had an opportunity of studying the condition of the American workman on the spot, and I unhesitatingly declare that in spite of his protection - perhaps because of it - his condition is immeasurably worse than that of the **British** worker.

* The workers on the goldfields, through the medium of the Goldfields Trades and Labour Council, have telegraphed a protest, and the Chamber of Mines - a body which represents an immense amount of **British** capital, and which is worthy of a considerable amount of attention by reason of what that money has done to open  up  the backblocks of Western Australia - -has also put forward a strong protest.

* There is another point, and that is that all this additional expense will tend to frighten **British** and foreign capitalists from investing in our mines.

* There is **British** Columbia, for instance, and the West Coast of Africa, and, now that things are becoming more settled in South Africa, the mines in the neighbourhood of Johannesburg will probably be started again.

* All these mines will offer fair inducements to **British** capitalists, and once we frighten capital away from Australia it will be very difficult to get it back.

* The resolution passed by these employes goes on to state - 
The people of Great Britain cannot long ignore the fact that at present the demand for the products of **British** labour sold in foreign countries is not increasing, but is rather diminishing from year to year, whilst the products of foreign labour are displacing those of Great Britain in **British** markets by leaps and bounds year after year.

* If a substantial, or even a moderate, preference in the **British** markets were given to our dairy, agricultural, and viticultural produce, a very great boon would be conferred upon us, and we should take a great step forward in the direction of making the Empire selfsupporting.

* ; particularly in view of the large portion of the world's surface that is occupied by **British** possessions and the vast resources of such territories.

* Therefore, it will be of the very greatest advantage, not only to the outlying portions, but to the heart of the **British** Empire, if a wise system of preferential trade were established.

* Are not honorable members aware that the **British** Empire comprises more than 300,000,000 of coloured subjects?

* If we thrust them out of one ship, they must get into another, or they must go somewhere else, in all probability, within the **British** Empire, to earn an honest living or starve.

* I should be the last to abandon those rights, amongst which I include this policy of a White Australia, which I have always supported; but in mercy's name, let us not try to sweep the  whole of the **British** Empire, and clear it of over 300,000,000 of coloured subjects.

* If it is desirable to clear these people out of **British** ships, surely that is a question for the -**British** people themselves to consider?

* Although, to a large extent, he takes the same view as I do upon this matter, and does not approve of it, my right honorable and learned friend the leader of the Opposition said the other night that he would approve of negotiating with the **British** Government with a view to give effect to such a policy as this.

* I prefer to let the **British** Government mind their own business and govern themselves and their own subjects as they think best.

* If my honorable and learned friend the Prime Minister had sent a protest to the **British** Government I should have said that he had no right to do so, but it was.

* I should, however, see a decided objection to our interfering to the extent of dictating to the **British** Government the course they should adopt.

* We must place the Registrar in a position similar to that which he occupies in every other part of the **British** Dominions.

* Copyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is a **British** subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in Australia, or plates made therefrom, or from platesor negatives made in Australia in cases where type is  not necessarily used, and  haS,  afterthe commencement of this Act, been published in Australia, before or simultaneously with its first publication elsewhere.

* Persons born in Papua of **British** parents should be entitled to pensions on meeting with severe accidents, just as they would be entitled had they beenborn on the mainland.

* much about the American practice, but I see no evidence of such a system being in force in any part of the **British** Empire.

* The Bill is simply an adaptation- of the English Act, and until some parts of the **British** Empire show a disposition to depart from the well-known practices of marine insurance, we may well allow the value of the American experiments to be tested before we adopt them.

* In view of the practice which has arisen in foreign countries of measuring vessels by a system which gives them an extraordinary gross tonnage in order that they may claim the largest bounty, and an exceptional net tonnage in order that they may obtain lower dues in **British** ports than are paid by **British** vessels - a state of affairs with which the Imperial Government has had to deal - will the Minister for Trade and Customs see that the matter is dealt with in any legislation, such as the Navigation Bill, introduced by the Government, so that in Australian ports **British** vessels may be on an equality with foreign vessels?

* There can be no objection to following the **British** Government in the steps they have taken 
In my view, the charge to which I have referred might have been levelled justly at the original measure, which was drafted in accordance with the wishes of the **British** Government.

* It was drafted with a desire to make the position of the **British** Government, in relation to foreign Powers, and particularly with those of the East, aseasy as possible.

* That is the system which I should like to see introduced in the Federal Territory, and also in **British** New Guinea, but this is not the time to move in that direction.

* But when they found that the **British** ring had put up prices in the way I have described they altered the whole of their machinery, and they are now ready to supply orders for wall-papers of English pattern and size for the Australasian market.

* These houses demand middlemen's profits, which he does not feel inclined to pay, and thus, in spite of his **British** predilections, he has been compelled to place a very large order for wall-papers with a German firm.

* The moral of my story is that the action of the **British** manufacturers served only to give another opportunity to the Germans, who are up-to-date in business methods, and who, as I shall prove presently, are monopolising practically the whole of the **British** colonial trade.

* That was one of the means by which they got ready to make an assault upon **British** colonial markets !

* I asked the Customs department to prepare for me some figures as to all **British** colonial possessions and the increase of German trade.

* The statement furnished to me by the Customs department shows the value of goods imported d directly into **British** possessions from G er many in certain years.

* Of course it may be objected that although the German trade has increased in that way, so, also, has **British** trade increased, as the population of the **British** possessions has become larger.

* During the period from 188 7 to 1896 the percentage of increase in the German trade with Australia was 134 per cent., whilst the percentage of **British** decrease was 5-l per cent.

* The industries of Germany have been brought into existence by the fiscal policy of that country- they have been further assisted by a splendid system of technical colleges, and as a result her manufacturers now export their goods to every market in the world, and have practically captured the major -portion of what used .to be **British** trade with **British** possessions.

* After some of our Federal legislation, I doubt whether Australia would be owned by the Australian people to-day, whether some other settlement would not have taken place here, if it were not for the power of the **British** Navy.

* Supposing the Government chose to declare by proclamation that there is danger of war in **British** Guiana, they would have power to compel every man in our permanent forces to go to India and fight the Afghans in the north-west.

* The best way oftentimes to prevent an attack is to attack, just as  President  Kruger ordered the advance on Natal in place of waiting for the **British** to attack him.

* The clause provides that the Governor-General may- 
Let us go back to the interpretation clause, which says that " emergency " means "war, or "invasion of any part of the **British** dominions, " national emergency " - that is, any emergency which the **British** Government think to be a national emergency - and the declarationby proclamation .

* All male inhabitants of Australia (excepting those who are exempt from service in the defence forced who have resided therein for six months, and are **British** subjects, and are between the ages of eighteen and sixty years.

* After six months residence in the Commonwealth he, being a **British** subject, and say between 30 and 40 years of age, is liable tobe called upon to serve in the defence force.

* He does not want to fight or enter the defence force, but a proclamation may be made that there is danger of war in **British** Guiana, or in Africa, and the Governor- General may call upon him to enter the defence forces, and when he is once in the defenceforces he must stay there for three years.

* The honorable member for West Sydney wishes to substitute "**British**" for "Imperial"; but that would leave the matter still uncertain, as a **British** Mint undoubtedly does exist at present in most of the Australian States.

* After all, the word " Imperial," as applied to the Old Land, is more typical and distinctive than the generic term "**British**."

* The honorable member for Parkes may not have observed a proviso in clause 5 to permit **British** coins, other than gold coins, to be legal tender in Australia, up to a date to be fixed by proclamation.

* In the event referred to, it would be our duty to forward the evidence and the finding of the Commission to the **British** Government to consider what steps, if any, it would take in regard to the actions of those who were at the time its officials.

* Mr. John  Dillon, M.P., said that a **British** sailor should not be subjected to the competition of men who would work for less than half his wages, and live on less than half his food.

* It would be considered unjustifiable to import coloured people in thousands to work in **British** factories.

* (Middlesborough), did not object to lascars being employed, but they should be so in the same terms with regard to wages, accommodation, and food as -**British** seamen.

* There were 40,000 lascars in the **British** mercantile marine, and the number was increasing, while that of the **British** was diminishing.

* The wages and maintenance of two lascars did not equal the cost of one **British** seaman.

* While 120 cubic feet of space was recommended by the **British** Royal Commission of Ia9I, for each seaman, lascars were allowed only thirty-six feet (barely the dimensions of a decent-sized coffin).

* Mr. Lloyd  George (Liberal, Carnarvon, Wales) noticed that while on the American lines and the Castle and Union lines 90 per cent, of the seamen were **British**, on tramps 30 per cent., on the P. and O.

* Company's vessels only 25 per cent, were **British**.

* Honorable members may not realize the seriousness of this, but it means that if **British** supremacy is to be maintained **British** seamen must be employed.

* If any one, be he an officer of a ship, a member of this House, or a citizen of Australia, will say that Britishers are not fit to man **British** ships, I contend that he lacks, in the highest possible sense, loyalty to the Empire.

* That is not the fault of the **British** seamen, but of the infamous laws that permit **British** ship-owners to do that which the laws of other nations do not allow in connexion with vessels flying their flags.

* If there were not, there ought to be, as when the **British** flag flew over South Africa he supposed the P. and O. would have at their disposal the labour of the Matabeles,  Bechuanas  Swazis, and other native tribes, and these men would work for 4d.

* Surely that should appeal to honorable members, and convince them that we require to employ **British** seamen in our ships.

* He would not do anything to weaken his own Government, would not vote against his Government, but he would not vote for them, as he held they had neglected their dutv in neglecting to make the employment of **British** seamen a condition of mail contracts.

* These were the words of an Admiral who wishes to uphold **British** supremacy on the seas.

* Mr. Ritchie,  the Chancellor of the **British** Exchequer said - 
If the law had not been complied with it was not for the want of strong remonstrances.

* The Government had called attention to the fact that the space supplied to Iascar seamen was not the space provided for **British** seamen, and that the P. and O.

* Co. fly the **British** flag, and are, 'therefore, to some extent, under the control of the Board of Trade, they are always able to plead that they are subject to the Indian regulations, and thus, to a large extent, evade the **British** law.

* Such conditions would only be endured by lascars, who are more kicked than petted if they raise objections, and, who, although they are **British** subjects, occupy a servile position.

* I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether he has read the report in yesterday's  Age,  of ari interview with  Mr. B.  H. Morgan, the representative of the **British** Manufacturers' Association, and the apparently wellfounded statements of that gentleman with respect -to the existence of a shipping ring  in Great Britain, which charges excessive freights on the goods of **British** manufacturers shipped to Australia, and by that, and other means, is acting prejudicially to .the trade between the Motherland and the Commonwealth?

* They seem to think that immediately they are passed, **British** ships will cease to come here, and that the Tasmanian apples will never reach London, because there will be no vessels to carry them there.

* But if a dispute occurred between the employes of Australian shipowners and their employers, the latter would probably urge that they could not increase wages because of the severe competition of **British** and foreign vessels to which they were subjected.

* Therefore, to make the awards of the Court of any value, they must, when necessary, be applicable to **British** and foreign vessels trading on the Australian coast.

* This could be done under the provision of the Merchant Shipping Act, which makes it clear that any **British** subject owning a ship may register it in Great Britain.

* No; a ship-owner could register his ships in England, start them from a **British** port, and never come back again.

* I fail to see any reason for the alarm which has been felt by some honorable members that **British** ships will not call here to take away our produce.

* A great deal has been said with regard to the magnitude of the **British** mercantile marine.

* I find by examination of the most recent figures that **British** steam-ships represent 53 per cent, of the total steam tonnage of the world.

* vessels cleared for **British** Possessions numbered 2,445, with a tonnage of 3,779,299.

* It will be found that whilst the **British** shipping in Australian ports has increased by only 44 per cent, during the last eleven years, the German shipping has increased to the extent of 191 per cent., and that of the United States by 43 per cent.

* But I have listened to the arguments with an open mind, and it appears -to me that no case has been made out against the clauses, and that there is no need for alarm with regard to interference with **British** shipping companies which trade with Australia.

* The Seamen's Union is a worldwide organization that has had a very large influence in regulating matters affecting **British** shipping.

* Because this House confidently relies upon the ' fairness and wisdom of the **British** people for the removal of every just Irish grievance in the manner most likely to promote the welfare of the Irish people, and the stability of the Empire.

* That body does not represent the **British** people in the same way that this Parliament represents the electors of the Commonwealth.

* We enjoy a liberal Constitution, and we wish to see every other constituent of the **British** Empire placed in a similar position* When a measure of Home Rule is granted to Ireland - as it will be some day - I trust that its Constitution will be similar to our own.

* I do not altogether agree with the following statement in the motion of the honor able and learned member for Northern Melbourne : - 
But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland.

* I cannot regard that statement as a strictly accurate one, because in 1866 the **British** Parliament passed the law which disestablished the Church of England in Ireland, and we must all admit that that extended a great measure 'of justice to that country.

* The Irish people were called upon to contribute to the support of a Church to which they were antagonistic, but after they had endured this injustice for a considerable time, the good sense of the **British** Parliament prevailed, and, despite all the evil predictions by extreme opponents of the movement, the relief afforded to the people of Ireland had the effect of strengthening the bonds of Empire.

* I have been a student of **British** politics for about thirty years, during which time I have watched closely the trend of events.

* The **British** Parliament has so far recognised its inability to effectively meet the pressing demands of the people in regard to domestic legislation that it has conferred upon County Councils and other municipal bodies much greater powers than we in this democratic land would dream of intrusting to such institutions.

* Ireland has given undoubted evidence of her loyalty to the **British** Empire through her politicians, who have taken a leading part in the administration of the various self-governing colonies, and in that of the centre of the Empire itself, and also through many men who have distinguished themselves in the **British** army and navy.

* Thus, whilst I agree with the leader of the Opposition that we should not unduly interfere in **British** politics - especially at a time when they are likely to assume an acute form - I say that upon the question of Home Rule for Ireland' we do not intervene on those lines.

* By the terms of the motion under discussion we are merely invited to express our appreciation of the benefits that would attend an extension of the powers of local government, with which the **British** Parlia-ment  has seen fit to endow a number of its possessions.

* We are simply asked to affirm, as the result of our own experience, that if a wider measure of local government were extended fo Ireland the **British** people would benefit thereby, and the stability of the Empire would be strengthened.

* I refer to the words - 
But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland.

* I admit that since the Act of Union Ireland has, perhaps, suffered greater injustice than has any other part of the **British** Empire.

* But, whilst this is so, I realize that the great body of **British** electors outside Ireland - and even many **British** politicians, in whose hands the destinies pf the Empire largely rest to-day - recognise the grievances of the Irish people, and are prepared "to attempt to redress them.

* I do not admit that 'future **British** Parliaments are likely to be less ready to do justice to the Irish people than is the Parliament of to-day.

* Another point is that a large section of the **British** people are not qualified under the electoral law to exercise the franchise.

* Fuller expression is being given to, the opinions of "the people, and- as the evolutionary tendencies of democracy extend the **British** Parliament must become more and more a reflex of the views of the whole people.

* I trust that the mover of the motion will agree to the deletion of the words I have mentioned, and, in order to lest the matter, I Leg to move - 
That the words " But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland," be left out.

* I look for a larger federation than, that - the federation of the English speaking people - and if that is unattainable, my desires run in the direction, not of disintegration, but in the direction of the federation of the **British** Empire.

* Seeing that our position to-day, and our prosperity is due to the protection afforded us by the ' **British** flag, ought we - who have been elected as the representatives of the first Commonwealth Parliament - to hesitate to send troops to England at a cost of 26,000, or IJd.

* A few years ago Australia did not occupy the place in the estimation of the world that she does at the present time, noi- was the .**British** Empire so consolidated.

* For some cause or other - perhaps chiefly through "the war in South Africa - the **British** Empire has been cemented to a greater degree than we could have anticipated a few years ago.

* As I said before, let us not forget that the Coronation of our King is of the same importance to us as it is to the people of the **British** Isles ; and that whatever we do we should do nothing which might give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme.

* Is he not going to follow the example of the late  Mr. Seddon  in saying that, whilst we legislate against dumping and the sending .of surplus products from foreign countries, produced by people who have no interest in **British** artisans, we will give a preference in favour of Great Britain?

* Mr. Chamberlain  urged that the Tariff which now exists might continue against the foreigner, but that lower duties should operate against the **British** manufacturer and exporter, so that the latter might be able to command that part of the trade .

* Is the amendment not designed to give preference to **British** goods ?

* Why would the Minister of Trade and Customs not assist a policy which offered a preference to our staple productsin Great Britain, and a preferential "market for **British** manufactures to certain foreign imports"?

* I am a strong advocate of the prohibition of the drink traffic; but I must admit that the weight of the evidence tends to show that it is almost impossible to effectively prohibit the sale of liquor in **British** New Guinea.

* There is no doubt that any **British** subject can get into Japan as a free citizen, without any stigma being cast on his colour or his race.

* We are creating an anomaly, and, in my opinion, a very mean position for ourselves as **British** subjects.

* He continued - to seriously consider that it may be better to suspend the operation of this Bill until it is known what the action of the **British** Government will be.

* I think it will be more courteous, more dignified, and equally independent if we allow sufficient time to the **British** Government to give a clear-cut opinion on this question before they allow the Bill to come into operation.

* Since then the **British** Government have given us rights in regard to immigration.

* We are brought in this debateface to face with the problem of our position as **British** citizens.

* We intend by this Bill, not merely to keep out coloured races who are aliens to ourselves, but coloured races who stand exactly in the same position as ourselves in every part of the world, and who seek the protection of the **British** flag.

* It is simply the fact that we are **British** citizens.

* If we were not **British** citizens, if with this enormous territory - because I am looking at it from the federal point of view - 
Well, even so, it does seem to me that our position would have been a stronger one - and that this House ought reasonably to ask for it before we pass a Bill like this - if the opinion of the **British** Government had been obtained as to how this Bill will be met when it gets to the old country.

* Then the Government would have the power to hold over this Bill, at any rate, until we saw whether it was in consonance with the views of the **British** Government, and we should not have the humiliation of passing a Bill and letting it be known to the world, and then having it stopped by the action of the Home Government.

* That speech was made with a view of pointing out to the assembled representatives of the **British** colonies, the difficulties of the **British** Government in assenting to certain classes of  leigslation.

* The legislative power was not denied, but it was pointed out that it drove the **British** Government into a position of withholding, if necessary, or of not withholding the Royal assent- that it placed the Government in the dubious and difficult position that if they did that which their hearts prompted them to do, in giving full sway to the legislation of autonomous countries such as these, it embarrassed, and might embroil their relations with other powers, and that it was not right to place the **British** Government to the stress, or the' Crown to the painful necessity of assenting to such acts if other equable and effective means could be found for carrying out the popular will.

* That Act waspassed without special reference to **British** subjects, it was passed for the exclusion of Hindoos.

* It was also represented to me that it had been tried at Natal, and had stopped Indian immigration - the immigration of **British** subjects.

* Would it not be equally objectionable in the eyes of the **British** Government ?

* That the care of the **British** Government was not to embarrass its relations with its 300,000,000 or 400,000,000 of coloured subjects, and perhaps provoke resentment from those to whom it owed gratitude for their stand in the defence of the Empire, and not to permit to pass measures calculated to cause trouble, much or little, between England and other nations.

* But the question whether a Bill, on the very face of which are scored lines of offence against those it does not want to offend, is one with which the **British** Government will deal, because it is a trustee for the whole Empire, of whom the white subjects are only one-eighth, and the peace of the Empire lies in its hands.

* There is an ultimate power in the **British** Government of exercising its trusteeship for the rest of the Empire by vetoing any kind of legislation which makes against either the interest of other parts of the Empire, or prejudices its external relations.

* Will the Minister say whether coloured **British** subjects are included in the figures which he is about to quote  1 
The honorable member is quite right.

* If the House is not in favour of that- system of control, it may be many months, and even years - we may even witness a change of Administration in England - before the Prime Minister can get the **British** Government to come into harmony with him with respect to the  personnel,  the distribution of vessels, and the interchange of officers between the.

* I submit, therefore - without putting the point in a party spirit at all - that on the grounds that I have advanced this vote ought not to be used as an argument to help the movement with the **British** Imperial naval authorities.

* And there was no necessity under the circumstances to fall back upon the **British** House of Commons procedure, unless it was desired by the Chair to arrogate powers which the Standing Orders did not confer or contemplate.

* The right honorable member held that in the Arbitration Bill there should be a clause providing that **British** or foreign steamers trading to Australia, and carrying passengers or cargo along our coasts, should be required to submit to compulsory arbitration, and, in that connexion, he gave a promise to certain representatives of labour, one of whom is now a member of the Parliament, by which he considered himself bound to the introduction of such a provision in the measure.

* The Arbitration Bill, as they propose to amend it, will not apply to foreign and **British** shipping trading on our coasts.

* I admit that it is the aboriginal labour of Australia.- But what will the **British** Government think if we employ Australian aborigines in carrying mails between various parts of the Commonwealth, whilst we refuse to allow aboriginal coloured labour from other parts of the Empire to be employed on **British** oceangoing ships under contract to carry our mails ?

* In the case of our ocean-going mails, we have to deal with **British** ships, which are, so to speak, **British** territory, and employ the aborigines of other parts of the **British** Empire.

* We are prepared to allow the aborigines of one part of the Empire to perform this work for us within our own territory, but we say that aborigines of other parts are not to be employed on the ocean in **British** ships engaged in carrying Australian mails.

* If it is desirable to exclude coloured seamen from **British** vessels employed in the carriage of mails under the contract system - and that is said to be the object of the section in the Postal Act which deals with this question - is it not desirable to exclude coloured seamen under the poundage system?

* Were it not for the protection of the **British** flag, there is no doubt that some overt act would have emanated from her long since.

* Does the honorable member not know that in the law institute at Tokio - an institute Based upon exactly the same lines as those which exist in Australia and other parts of the **British** Dominions - only a" few months ago a question raised and discussed was whether Australia had complied with international law by the effective occupation of her territory?

* We are also told that there is in the possession of the **British** Government a gun which can project a shell from London to Paris.

* I trust that we shall always remain part of the **British** Empire.

* We can be sure that the great ocean trade routes will be kept open by the **British** Navy, and we can best assist the Mother Country in doing that by looking after our own coastal defence, thus relieving her of the enormous expense at present entailed by the maintenance of a Squadron in these waters.

* There are **British** officers who would be glad to come to Australia for the purpose of placing our naval defence upon a satisfactory footing.

* Australian officers have been exchanged with **British**  officers,  and in the press to-day we read of a smart young.

* He has now accepted a staff appointment in the **British** Army and has sailed away.

* I do not wish to see that spirit en- gendered among the forces in Australia, although I certainly consider that the Rova Horse Artillery is the pride of the **British** Army, and if I were a young man, would once more enlist in it.

* But the sad history of Ireland since the act of union shows that no **British** Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economies and social conditions of Ireland.

* In 1888 a contract was made between the .**British** Government and the Peninsular and Oriental arid Orient Steam Navigation Companies for the conveyance of mails to and from Australia for a subsidy f :i 7&gt;o per annum, our contribution to which on a  -per capita  basis was .75,000 per annum.

* The **British** Government, in making arrangements with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for the carriage of mails to Australia, secured more speedy transit and a slight reduction in subsidy, and it is difficult to understand why, after all the advances which have been made during the past seventeen years, and the greater facilities which now exist for the economical running of steamers and conveyance of mails, an alarming increase in the subsidy should be required by the Orient Steam Navigation Company.

* The **British** Government provided for a service to the East as well as to Australia, and their total subsidy to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company amounted to 330,000 per annum, or 4s.

* per mile, but the **British** Government obtained special advantages in regard to the use of the vessels of the company for naval purposes, and in other directions, which accounts for the difference.

* In the new contract between the **British** Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company there will be a reduction of subsidy amounting to 15,000 per annum if the contract lasts for the usual term of seven years, which is remarkable in view of the fact that we have had to increase our subsidy to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and the service given by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company has been expedited by twenty-four hours, the length of the journey being now 662 hours, and the rate of speed approximately sixteen knots.

* In the light of these figures, one can easily see what a distinct advantage it would be to us if we could enter into a contract with a company which would carry our mailsas speedily as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company liners carry them under contract with the **British** postalauthorities.

* Subject to which I have devoted a great deal of attention from my youth, and it is -a source of very great satisfaction to me to have now an opportunity of legislating for the Government of **British** New Guinea.

* I look forward to the time when we shall in all probability confer a Constitution on other islands of the Pacific, just as we are doing in the case of **British** New Guinea.

* So far as I have been able to gather the powers conferred upon them by the **British** Government are not dissimilar from those which we now propose to give them.

* The white population of **British** New Guinea comprises about 500 souls, and of that number 300 are miners.

* A minute analysis of the returns relating to the revenue and expenditure of **British** New Guinea will show, as mentioned yesterday by the Treasurer, that its revenue is derived chiefly from the natives themselves.

* In support of this course, the plausible statement will probably be made that **British** people like to govern themselves, and that those living on the spot must have a better knowledge of the legislation best suited to the requirements of the people, and the development of the country which they have made their own.

* The raining population of **British** New Guinea totals 350 persons, in addition to whom there are about 1 50 missionaries and officials.

* There is no doubt that the climate of **British** New Guinea is very trying.

* The Prime Minister has declared that it is the intention of the Government to afford preferential treatment to the traders of **British** New Guinea who come under theaegis of the Commonwealth.

* He thinks only of our harbors and coasts, forgetting that our existence as a country depends on the power and strength of the **British** Navy.

* I wish to say for myself that I have no possible sympathy with the kind of memorial which it is proposed to erect, having regard to the vast sum which it is proposed to expend on it, no matter whether it be in relation to a great statesman or to the greatest monarch the **British** people have ever had.

* That 109,000,000 of trade is made up in this way - with the United Kingdom, 66,613,161 ; with other **British** possessions, 15,387,679 ; and with foreign countries, 27,601,263.

* So that we come to this singular fact which honorable members will notice - that of this total, the trade which other **British** possessions and foreign countries carried on with us amounted to 42,988,94:2.

* experts of all nations, I think, and is moreover, un opinion verified amply in **British** history.

* Coming again to this question of the comparison of trade, I mentioned that our trade with other **British** possessions and foreign countries came to 43,000,000 a year, or 40 per cent, of the whole.

* That very surrender arose from the failure of the **British** fleet to keep up communications with the land forces, which were acting in defence of **British** interests in America.

* My point is that this Parliament should not have made any representation either to the King or the **British** Government on the subject of an alteration in the parliamentary system of the mother country.

* Will he communicate at once with the **British** authorities requesting them to insist on the terms of the convention being observed equally by **British** and French traders?

* I am sure that the whole, or the great bulk of the people of Australia, including hundreds of thousands of loyal sons and daughters of the Empire, will be proud that this motion has been submitted, not as a mere matter of form, or in order to dispose, for the time being, of a formal duty, but as expressive of our deep and unwavering sympathy with the Imperial Government and the **British** people in the great problem and campaign on which they have so long been engaged.

* I am quite sure that if it were an unjust warit would have been impossible for it to have received the universal support of **British** people all over the face of the globe.

* I do not believe that all the gold in the Transvaal or in the world itself, would be able to purchase the moral and political support of the people of the United Kingdom and the sympathy of the **British** colonies, which has been manifested during the progress of this campaign.

* These manifestos, and many others of the same type, such, for instance, as the notorious appeal to Afrikanders to rise against the **British** yoke, which had been written by  Mr. Ben.

* The war was to be one for the supremacy of Af rickanderdom, and the expulsion of the **British** power from South Africa.

* What is true is that the Transvaal went to war sooner than concede a small instalment of reform, and had no sooner declared war than it openly avowed that the object of that war was, not the maintenance of the Transvaal franchise in its existing form, but the destruction of the **British** power in South Africa.

* They wanted to establish a South African Republic to the exclusion of **British** power and supremacy there.

* He expresses the opinion that the tremendous exertions of the **British** in the Transvaal had strengthened Great Britain, and that the historical and racial ties uniting Canada, Australia and Great Britain form a stronger bond of union than any constitution, 
The devotion of the **British** colonies has not in the opinion of the writer been influenced by material interest.

* quite agree with the Prime Minister that we must be careful not to place any embarrassment in the way of the **British** Government.

* However, I shall have another opportunity of dealing with the matter, and I will therefore content myself with saying that, having had some years of experience in connexion with these islands, I am well aware of the importance, from the point of view of **British** interests, of looking after the islands, especially as there is a  movment  in Prance which otherwise might result in their annexation.

* To talk about a contribution of 200,000 per annum being of any importance or value to the **British** Admiralty, in view of its annual expenditure of between 30,000,000 and 40,000,000, is in my opinion utterly fatuous.

* I think, however, that by means of a local expenditure of the present subsidy of 200,000, plus an equal amount from revenue upon the creation of the nucleus of a sea defence, we could render to the Empire as a whole a service more efficient than can be secured by a contribution of 200,000 per annum to the **British** Navy.

* I venture to assure the leader of the Opposition that a proposed allocation of revenue for the creation of an Australian Navy, or for Australian coastal defence, if he prefers to so describe it, would meet with a much heartier response from the taxpayers of Australia than would a contribution by the Commonwealth Government for the up-keep of the **British** Naval Squadron in these waters.

* peace we work our land forces according to the drill manual of the **British** Army.

* If, in the case of our land forces, we have the same drill and use the same weapons and ammunition as are employed in the **British** Army ; if but for the fact that we have our own officers, we follow the **British** land system of defence, how can it be said that it is impossible to follow the high traditions attaching to the **British** Navy in relation to particular methods of naval defence ?

* In respect to the actual command of our troops, and the methods of drill as well as in other directions we work on the lines of the **British** Army, and I think that apart altogether from the num ber of troops we are going to have - whether we are to have a militia or a volunteer force or a system of compulsory training, which, by the way, I favour - we have in Australia officers capable of undertaking the highest command that could be given them here.

* I could name several who would make no greater bungle than was made during the South African war by some of the **British** generals.

* I do not for a moment say that there are not in the **British** Army generals with much greater knowledge and ability than are possessed by Australian officers; but our chances of obtaining one of them is verv much like the chance of drawing a winning number in a lottery.

* I can recall two or three places in the **British** Empire where there are non-official members in the local .

* I can recall three places in the **British** Empire where non-official members of the Legislature are appointed by the Lieutenant*- 
At any rate in the Transvaal there is a majority of black people.

* Similarly, at Malta there are nine nonofficial members who are elected by the Italian population, as against the **British** residents.

* I wonder whether these words were written by the honorable and learned member who was the author of the Tariff - the man who spent eighteen months in this House trying to build the Tariff wall as high as he could in order to prevent the importation of **British** goods.

* But foreign competition with our Australian manufactures is not nearly so keen as is that of the **British** manufacturers!

* In many cases it may be, but the figures which have been quoted during this debate show that the main competition is between Australian and **British** manufacturers.

* Although he has granted a preference to **British** goods, upon two occasions that preference has been in the nature of a free gift.

* Anybody who reads the Home papers must know that the fate of the present **British** Government is sealed.

* I am quite aware that in some of our Colonies preferences have already been granted to **British** products.

* But there is a speech of  Sir Wilfrid  Laurier's  bearing on these questions which I recommend you to cut out and lake to your homes and preserve as the best possible statement of the situation and relations of the **British** Empire in its various parts which has ever been uttered by a **British** statesman. "

* There are parties who hope to maintain the **British** Empire on the lines of restricted trade " - there were not many people when he said this of that kind ; there is one very eminent one now. "

* If  the  **British** Empire is to be maintained it can only be by the most absolute freedom, political and commercial, in building up this great Empire.

* What happened in Canada was that a preference was given to **British** goods, and subsequently the protectionists said to the Government, " You have given them too much ; you must increase the duties again."

* Wherever he goes, he is- able to appeal to the **British** Consul, towards the maintenance of whom he has not contributed a penny, and to obtain the same protection from him as  a man who has been contributing to the cost of his office in the old land.

* Possibly the members of the late Administration were rather sorry that they had anything to do with the matter, because they saw that, if the official Australian flag were used, it would have to be flown from the ships of the fleet paid for and controlled by Australia, while the **British** flag would be flown from the vessels partly paid for by Australia, but entirely under Imperial control.

* Recent events have shown the necessity for the Empire to develop new centres of strength, and with this end in view My Advisers some time ago cabled to the **British** Government suggesting the advisability of a Conference of the self-governing Dominions of the Empire with the Government of the United Kingdom on the question of Naval Defence.

* A similar suggestion having been made by the Dominion of Canada, the **British** Government has now convened an Imperial Naval and Military Defence Conference, and has invited the Commonwealth to send representatives.

* I am one who regard it as clear that no empire in the history of the world has done so much for civilization and for liberty as has the **British** Empire.

* They regard themselves as having in their trust the maintenance of the **British** flag.

* There is a very laudable anxiety to find justice on the **British** side, and to show Great Britain that we are still her sons, and are still willing to help her.

* I do not join in the chorus of cries against our gallant army ; I consider that injustice has been done to our forces, both **British** and Colonial.

* We have no kinder hearted men in the -world than **British** soldiers and Australian troops.

* Injustice has even been done to the tactics of **British** soldiers in this war ; but I am not dealing with that matter now.

* That all  re-inforcements  of troops which have arrived in South Africa since the 1st June, 1S99, shall be removed from South Africa within a reasonable time to be agreed upon with this Government, and with a mutual assurance and guarantee on the part of this Government that no attack upon or hostilities against any  portion  of the possessions of the **British** Government shall be made by the Republic during further negotiations within a period of time to be subsequently agreed upon between the Governments, and this Government will, on compliance therewith, be prepared to withdraw the armed burghers of this Republic from the borders.

* As soon as it was found that the Boers were more prepared than was at first supposed, and that the war was not to be merely a parade to Pretoria, beginning with the waving of the " red, white, and blue " and ending with champagne, there was great disgust, and the cry was raised that there was an arrangement to drive the **British** into the sea.

* It is common newspaper statement, but I deny that it is common knowledge ; and I challenge him to find any proof of a conspiracy to drive the **British** into the sea.

* I put it expressly, so that honorable members may see how far I go, that there can be found no evidence from 1884 to 1895 of any preparation for war on the part of the Boers; and it is but natural, having regard to what was done by **British** subjects with **British** officers amongst them, that the Boers became suspicious, and they were made still more suspicious by the fiasco - I do not wish to use a stronger word - of the House of Commons inquiry of 1897, when certain letters were not produced.

* I am quite sure, however, that the **British** Government will do its best to remedy the existing defects.

* I believe that any proper system of control over the liquor traffic in **British** New Guinea would prove too costly, and, therefore, I think that we had better prohibit its introduction into the Possession.

* That, in view of their strategical importance to the safety of **British** and Australian commerce in the Pacific, consequent on the projected opening of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama, the Commonwealth Government' should afford every facility for Australian settlement in the New Hebrides Islands, and should represent to the **British** Government the importance of endeavouring to arrive at a more satisfactory agreement with the French Government respecting their control than that at present existing.

* In view of the fact, however, that so much publicity has already been given to it in the French, as well as in the **British** and Australian newspapers, I think that the time has arrived to approach it publicly and boldly.

* My object was to bring the matter under the notice of the New South Wales Ministry, and induce them to make representations to the **British** authorities, with the ultimate idea of securing the annexation of the Ha waiian Islands, New Guinea, and the New Hebrides.

* Besides shortening the distance to Australia from **British** and Eastern American parts, such a route would prove invaluable in the event of war with any of the Continental European Powers, avoiding both the Cape of Good Hope and the Mediterranean routes, which would involve such enormous risks to commerce in such an event.

* Perhaps this may be so ; but surely it is the duty of every Australian and **British** citizen to take an interest in all questions affecting the future welfare and prestige of these two countries both acknowledging the one Sovereign.

* And it is only when we realize the possibilities - nay, the probabilities - of development in the not far distant future, that the necessity for effective policing of the future Pacific Ocean highway of **British** commerce becomes forcibly impressed upon our minds with startling emphasis'.

* A few years hence it may be more difficult if not impossible should French interests become paramount over **British** interests there - a development which  I  regard as extremely probable, and' as a very serious matter of concern to Great Britain and Australia both.

* Notwithstanding the representations which were made, notwithstanding that they were regarded so lightly by the then Prime Minister of England, and subsequently by other Ministers, we find that foreign interests have been fostered under our eyes, whilst **British** interests have been just as consistently neglected.

* Yes ; probably at the present time, and I sincerely hope the comity of the **British** and American nations will be preserved for all time, for their mutual benefit, and that of the Englishspeaking races generally.

* The islands have passed from **British** control for ever.

* In regard to the New Hebrides, it must be recollected that some of them were discovered by Captain Cook, that they were mainly surveyed at **British** expense, and that they have been developed by **British** missionary enterprise.

* The Presbyterian Mission was a very strong factor in the early development of these islands, which, properly speaking, should have passed under **British** control.

* But, although this matter has been brought before the **British** authorities upon several occasions, unfortunately it has not received serious consideration at their hands.

* A similar thing ma-" happen in regard to the New Hebrides, unless we are particularly careful to watch Australian and **British** interests, and to promote by every possible means "the settlement of **British** subjects there i:i preponderating numbers.

* I do not know that we can altogether blame the **British** authorities in this connexion, because at that time the construction of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama was such a remote contingency that it might well have been disregarded.

* But the probable realization of that work in the immediate future puts a totally different aspect upon this question, both from ths **British** and the Australian stand-point.

* At the present time the French preponderate over the **British**, their numbers being respectively 255 and 214.

* As a naval station, it is absolutely unrivalled, and it is capable of accommodating the whole **British** fleet at the same time.

* Unfortunately, the **British** settlers in the New Hebrides are hampered by a prohibitive Tariff, so -far as the export of their produce to Australia is concerned.

* Unfortunately the Commonwealth has adopted an opposite policy in dealing with **British** settlers in the New Hebrides.

* The **British** settlers there find themselves so handicapped in competing with the French settlers that, according to a repot t which recently appeared in the press - but for the truth of which I cannot vouch - a great number of them are now seeking to become naturalized French subjects, their object being to secure the advantages of the French laws in relation to trade.

* It is needless to point out that if this course of action be persisted in it must seriously affect the chances of **British** supremacy in the islands.

* Whatever may be the value of the titles held in respect of land purchased from the natives, common-sense suggests that the ultimate decision in regard to the question of title will rest upon the numerical strength of the population, and also upon the value of the interests of that population, whether it be French or **British**.

* It is for this reason that I urge that it is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth should give very serious consideration to the importance of encouraging by every legitimate mean's the settlement of Australians and Britishers generally on this group, and more particularly on Mallicollo and Sandwich Islands, which possess two ports that, from a **British** naval strategic stand-point, are of immense value.

* With the opening of the Panama Canal a very large proportion of the trade now passing through the Suez Canal and over, the Indian Ocean will  be transferred to the Pacific, and Great Britain will then find it of great importance to have some effective means of policing the South Pacific, and of protecting **British** and Australian commerce in time of war.

* I have submitted this motion in the hope that it will receive the prompt consideration that its importance demands, and that the **British** authorities will make some arrangement with the French Government to secure a more satisfactory means of control than that which at present exists.

* I should like to call attention to the efforts which France is making to assist her settlers in the New Hebrides, and to emphasize the disabilities under which **British** and Australian settlers labour.

* I use the word " patriotic " advisedly, because Colonel Burns is, I think, actuated far more by patriotic than by commercial motives in endeavouring to secure **British** supremacy in these islands.

* Fiji is under **British** control, but the New Hebrides are under a dual control, and an arrangement has been made by which that dual control is to continue for a certain number of years.

* There are **British** possessions, which, although of no great value to us, might be far more beneficial to France than is her share in the control of the New Hebrides.

* We do not give the **British** settlers in these islands any rebate, nor do we refund for their advantage the duties collected from them.

* I am dealing with the question in a national spirit, and with the desire to see the **British** Empire have the same powerful influence in the Southern seas that it has in other parts of the world.

* The- French are increasing the facilities given to their settlers, in order to drive **British** trade away from these islands, so that theymay ultimately have absolute control of them.

* Australia should give facilities to her own settlers in these islands, and should encourage the colonization of the islands by people of the **British** race, not necessarily because of the advantage which, that will give the Commonwealth!, but because "of the advantage which the possession of the islands by Great Britain will be to us.

* If we allowed the produce of **British** settlers, grown in the islands, to enter the Commonwealth free, we should be doing something for our people there.

* In my opinion,we should hold out every inducement to Australians to colonize these islands, so that  eventually  the chief part of the population  will  become **British**, and Great Britain  will  secure supreme control over them.

* The paramount end in view should be the establishment of **British** supremacy in the group.

* We should do ali Ave can to encourage settlement there, so that the islands may become more and more a **British** Possession.

* In conclusion, I express the fer- vent hope that the matter will receive the earnest consideration of the Government, and that they will make a strong recommendation to the **British** Government as to the  importance of the question as it affects Australian and **British** interests in the South Pacific.

* In starting what is called our "national life" - that is the expression used, although I do not at all agree with it - and considering that last year the **British** Parliament expressly gave us a power to legislate as to any races which we might think fit to make laws about, we must assume that.

* the **British** Parliament did not mean to leave that power helpless and useless on our hands.

* 1 am not going to assume that the **British** Parliament did not mean to repose that confidence in us.

* They do not want their people to come here ; and, besides, there never has been a policy within the **British** Empire that I know of, that every subject is to be at liberty to go to any part of the Empire.

* I want to know what it is ; and I shall give the Ministry every opportunity to inform the committee, so long as that course does not embarrass the **British** Government.

* I did think it was the **British** privilege that we could say what we want to say, and "fling our thoughts, not fearing, into words."

* I am assured that the honorable member is as loyal to the **British** Crown as any one else, and that there was no ground for the attack made upon him.

* The honorable member for Melbourne has put it that the **British** Oil Company is saying, "You knock us out, and the Standard Oil Company will make you pay through the nose."

* If, in the circumstances, it is well to enable a **British** company to obtain a share of the business, it would be well also to assist a third company.

* In how many **British** and foreign papers did the Department advertise inviting tenders for the plant referred to?

* Mr. Ramsay  Macdonald, a member of the **British** Labour Party, has stateddistinctly that an increase in the cost of living has taken place in New Zealand.

* Here we have in a nutshell the hollow insincerity of those professions of a desire to give preference to **British** goods.

* In all cases the only action has been to leave the duties high enough against the mother country to hamper it in its trade with Australia,to secure local protection, and to make the duties higher still against foreign countries; and most of the articles singled out for this left-handed kind of  preference are articles which are not sent in any large quantities by **British** manufacturers to Australia.

* They must look on us as a particularly mean, sordid, grasping, greedy, insincere community ; at any rate, we must be regarded in a most unenviable and unjust light in consequence of the clumsy efforts of the present Government and their supporters to try to persuade the **British** community that they are to have preference, -while, at the same time, every effort is being made to block trade in **British** products.

* The Government might, at least, be honest with the **British** public and statesmen, andsay, "Well, gentlemen, while willing to give you an apparent advantage over the foreigner to the extent of raising the duties against the latter, our real object is to Veep you out of our markets if we can by means  of a. high Tariff against your goods, so long as we can have similar goods produced by our own people."

* The honorable member does  mot  really want to give any **British** preference.

* I amprepared to give  preference to **British** -goods and trade throughout the Empire, but I would do so in the directionof reducing duties.

* If pos sible that yeomanry should be brought from the **British** Isles.

* Do Ministers intend to propose the cancellation of that Agreement, or will they intimate to the **British** authorities that they misrepresented public opinion on the subject?

* Although I am thoroughly Australian in sentiment, I am just as thoroughly **British** in sentiment, and I recognise that the moment we cut the painter from the mother country, Australia is doomed.

* The **British** Navy alone is our present safeguard against foreign invasion.

* But the Government propose to give a preference to **British** goods imported here in **British** vessels, and we wish to insist upon the further condition that those vessels shall be manned by **British** sailors.

* During the investigations of the 
Shipping Commission, I asked  Mr. Kenneth  Anderson, the  chairman  of the Orient Company, if he had seen certain figures of the Board of Trade relating to the number of foreigners and lascars employed in the **British** mercantile marine.

* - Yes; as regards the deck hands and stewards, I should say, without exception, they are **British**.

* - Yes, and I should say that the great majority of the stokers at present are **British**.

* The honorable member for Hindmarsh says that he is opposed to the employment of lascars, but that he would not object to the employment of Germans on **British** vessels in regard to which the proposed preference will be given.

* No doubt the wars of the future will be fought chiefly in the fields of industry, and I do not see why the honorable member for Hindmarsh, who will not allow the employment of an Indian **British** subject, should be prepared to grant preference to those Europeans who may be our industrial and political enemies.

* When it is proposed to subsidize the **British** shipowner, support is given; but when we ask that something shall be done for those employed on **British** vessels, we are told that our proposition is ridiculous and absurd.

* I think that if we imposed such  a  condition as that indicated, it would have  a  tendency to secure the shipment of goods by ships manned by **British** crews.

* Some objection might be urged to requiring that the crew shall be exclusively **British**, but, after  all,  Germany finds it possible to enforce such a condition.

* For the sake of securing the bounty under consideration, he practically asks honorable mem.mers to stop the importation of that 120,000 worth of fish of **British** origin.

* Perhaps the reason why the New Hebrides question was not taken up seriously by the **British** Government during the discussion and adjustment of differences between France and England was that the Australian people, through their administrators, have shown great apathy in connexion with these islands.

* If Australia does nothing to encourage the settlement of these islands by **British** subjects, she cannot hope to acquire any standing in them.

* They may have written despatches and minute's very much to the point, and suggesting  that  it is desirable that these islands should be annexed for the future advantage of Australia, but they have taken no practical step which would lead the **British** Government to believe that the Australian people are in earnest in the matter.

* The consequence is that numbers of men and women who are French subjects are finding their way to the islands of the New Hebrides Group, and there are now a greater number of French  than  of **British** subjects in the islands.

* By removing duties at present imposed on the produce of the islands we might greatly encourage the settlement of **British**  subjects in the New Hebrides, and in the not too far distant future we might look forward to their being taken over for Australia.

* At that time, the Government of the Emperor of Germany moved in the matter of taking over the Samoan group of islands, and the **British** Government  surrendered  **British** influence in Samoa to the Germans as the price of the friendship of Germany when Great Britain was in trouble.

* After the shedding of **British** blood and the spending of **British** capital in the endeavour to settle the differences between the natives and Europeans in the Samoan group, **British** statesmen made an absolutely free gift of their influence in the group to the Germans.

* virtue of our occupation of **British** New Guinea.

* The **British** at that time possessed influence in Tonga, and the Germans had no influence whatever there.

* They therefore gave absolutely nothing, and the alleged surrender of influence in Tonga was merely intended to lead the people of Australia to believe that they were getting something for the surrender of **British** influence in the Samoan group.

* But if the Government would make some move for the settlement of the New Hebrides by **British** subjects, by encouraging trade and by the removal of duties on trade between Australia and the group, they would show that they were in earnest, and their representations would have much greater influence in the future with the **British** Government than they have had in the past.

* Yes, but the collector of Customs would be the prosecutor, and the honorable and learned member would not like to have to prove to the satisfaction of the prosecutor that a client for whom he was acting was not guilty.We are going: away from **British** law altogether in saying; that one man shall decide, and that no appeal shall be allowed from his decision, as is provided in other cases of far less importance.

* The protectionists were anxious for the support and preservation of **British** industries; bur it was the free-traders who, during the electoral campaign, used the word " retaliation " most effectively.

* But the honorable member must admit that under present conditions our workmen are subject to being thrown 'out of employment by the importation of foreign as well as **British** manufactures.

* As far as the **British** Empire is concerned, I venture to say that just as in all its might and its majesty it has managed to remain free and united with all its different races, each living in its own realms, so it will never be so strong as when it adds to its strength the strength of an Anglo-Saxon Australia.

* Honorable members can easily understand that only men of wealth could join that corps, which is one of the crack corps of the **British** service.

* There was a loss to the **British** army.

* There is a small arms factory at Enfield, which is a little way out of London, where they make all the arms for the **British** service, and from whence they palm off the old stocks upon the States.

* The **British** Government - conservative as it is - does not do things in such an offhand manner as does the Government of Victoria.

* In England, from the moment a man goes into these factories his life is insured by the **British** Government.

* I have always advocated an Australian Navy, but not a larger contribution to the **British** Navy.

* That is what makes me fear that we are about to commit ourselves to taking part in all the naval battles of the **British** Empire, whether we desire to do so or not, or whether it is necessary for us to interfere or not.

* We in Australia, without a single training college, talk about keeping ourselves up to the **British** standard, but let me tell the House what a lieutenant in the **British** Navy has to do.

* That sort pf thing cannot happen in the **British** Navy.

* After eight years' training the **British** naval officer is sent to a naval college, and then he becomes only a sub-lieutenant.

* We have therefore in front of us a considerable task if we intend to keep our Navy up to the standard of the **British** Navy, unless the Minister is prepared to expend extraordinary sums which have not been provided for up to the present.

* A **British** naval officer learns to work the gun, from the position of powder man right up to that of captain.

* In fact, the Bill would have been taken into Committee after only four speeches had been' delivered on it if I ha( not stepped into the breach, although ii contains the principle of compulsory train ing, which is one of the most important ever introduced in the **British** Empire.

* The more I look into the Minister's speech the more I fear that something has been done at the Imperial Conference which will constitute our Army and Navy simply an integral part of the **British** armaments.

* It is true that it applies to the **British** territorials, although that is something new in the Old Country.

* No man can be a thorough officer unless he has been trained in the ranks, and it will be a good thing for the Old Country when that rule is observed in connexion with the **British** Army.

* The reason why the **British** Navy has reached such a magnificent stage of efficiency as against the comparatively disorganized state which the Army is in, is that every naval officer has had to do that which the sailors do.

* It is officially admitted that " average **British** recruits are, on enlistment, not only the youngest, but are in the poorest physical condition of those in any civilised army.

* That being so, we have no choice but to follow the procedure laid down in our standing order, and copied from that of the **British** House of Commons.

* That would be apparent if a restriction were imposed upon all imports except those from New Zealand ; the **British** Empire is included in this scheme.

* For instance, in 1786, a treaty was entered into by Pitt, which was extolled because it was the first treaty to which the **British** Government was a party in which the procedure adopted was a reduction of the duties upon imports.

* But in  i860  the suggestion was accepted by  Mr. Gladstone  that a reciprocal treaty should be entered into with France - a treaty based upon the abolition of the duties upon all manufactured goods which still remained in the **British** Tariff, and upon a reduction in the imposts upon many **British** exports to France, with a still further reduction in a year or two.

* There will be a sweep summary, entire, and absolute, of what are known as manufactured goods, from the face of the **British**.

* Upon the other hand, several articles of **British** export to France were to be brought under a gradually descending scale of duties from prohibition - the maximum being fixed at  30  per cent.

* According to the proposals submitted by the Prime Minister, the result of its adoption would be the displacement of 140,000 worth of **British** goods now annually entering our markets.

* per lb., whilstthose imported from all other countriesincluding the rest of the **British** Empire - will be dutiable at 2d.

* The Treasurer paid some attention to the question of taking over **British** New Guinea.

* Every debt which is guaranteed in Europe in that way stands at the most satisfactory rate in the **British** money market.

* That speech was applauded by Government supporters, but I should like to know from them if they think that the expenditure he recommended is absolutely necessary for the defence of Australia, and to offer protection to **British** ships visiting these waters ?

* We should, know whether any such sum is necessary to make provision for the proper defence of Australia, to meet the requirements of the **British** fleet in these waters, and to protect our trade.

* On dutiable goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, and imported direct in **British** ships.

* That after ..the words "United Kingdom" the words "by white **British** workmen " be inserted.

* Yes, but I also wish, to be in keeping with this scheme, to prevent preferential treatment being extended to goods produced by white foreign labour, or to **British** goods carried in vessels manned by other than **British** seamen.

* It is proposed now to discriminate between the products of **British** labour and those of Germans and Scandinavians, .

* Upon 'a former occasion, I quoted figures which I contended should induce us to take into consideration the condition of affairs in the **British** mercantile marine.

* Of 176,000 seamen employed in **British** ships, 80,000 are either coloured or of foreign nationality.

* There does not appear to be the same necessity for insisting that the goods that are the subject of preference shall be made by white **British** workmen, as for stipulating that these goods shall be carried in shipsmanned exclusively by white **British** seamen.

* In the first place, this system fits in with the **British** system.

* We retain the **British** sovereign, that great standard of value, not only for the **British** possessions but largely for the world.

* We cannot under any future circumstances get closer to the **British** system, and we have an indication of the direction which **British** decimalization will take when adopted by the fact that, on the report of a Committee of the House of Commons in favour of the decimal system the florin has been coined as an advance guard of the system, and as an indication of the direction in which **British** coinage will move when decimalization is adopted.

* The American dollar seems too large for a unit, just as the franc, to **British** people, at any rate, seems too small.

* We propose to adopt something between the two, and something which has been practically adopted bv the **British** Government, as the unit of our decimalized system.

* The great objection is that it will throw our coinage out of gear with the **British** coinage.

* The people of Ecuador even accept the **British** sovereign as a coin of circulation, and every other gradation is exactly that which the Committee recommend.

* We, and the **British** people, ought to move as soon as possible in obtaining these advantages for ourselves.

* They have there a large population - 40,000,000 - and an enormous trade, and they have to contend against the sentiment which is satisfied with a good solid system of coinage that has existed for generations, and (would be apt to look upon a change as almost an interference with the **British** Constitution.

* shall accomplish our object more easily and readily than bymaking the change at an earlier date, because we may expect the **British** Government to adopt a decimal system of coinage.

* The **British** authorities are giving their attention to what I admit is a much larger question, namely, the decimalization of weights and measures.

* This will include, not only members of the Government of Great Britain, but the principal advisers of the Government on all military and naval matters, who really, decide the form and character of **British** naval and land defences.

* In 18421 a Copyright Bill, introduced by Lord Stanhope - Talfourd in the meantime having been raised to the Bench - was passed, and it embodies part of the law of copyright at present prevailing throughout the **British** Empire.

* It declared that whoever first published a took in the United Kingdom had a copyright in respect of it throughout the whole of the **British** Dominions.

* But a person who first published a book in any other part of the **British** Dominions was not given, by virtue of that publication, copyright throughout the Empire.

* Those in the outlying **British** Possessions, therefore, were placed at a disadvantage.

* The Act was found to operate harshly in some of the **British** Possessions - notably in Canada - and in 1847 another measure was passed, which allowed the suspension of the prohibition against the importation of foreign  reprints  in any part of the Empire which had provided reasonable protection to the **British** author.

* By means of this Act the people of Canada were able to obtain cheap reprints, which were copyright in other parts of the **British** Empire, and the authors benefited by the duties imposed.

* The provisions of the Literary Copyright Act of 1842 were also made applicable to them, so that their rights were protected throughout the **British** Empire.

* The Act of 1886 is of importance to us, because under it any book first produced in Aus- tralia is protected not only in the **British** Empire, but also in those countries which were signatories to the Berne Convention.

* It is also desirable to preserve in Australia any rights of copyright which are obtained in any part of the **British** Empire by virtue of the provisions of Imperial legislation ; and, as regards works which are produced in Australia, and with which we have power to deal, to.

* In the first place, I ask honorable members to look at clause 7, which provides - 
Copyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is a **British** subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in Australia, or plates made therefrom, or from plates or negatives made in Australia in cases where type is not necessarily used, and has, after the commencement of this Act, been published in Australia, before or simultaneously with its first publication elsewhere.

* It is provided that copyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is or is not a **British** subject.

* Performing right shall subsist in every dramatic or musical work, whether the author is a **British** subject or not, which has, after the commencement of this Act, been performed in public in Australia, before or simultaneously with its first performance in public elsewhere.

* He reckoned that the number of **British** authors in a century whose works survived forty-two years was only sixty-five.

* He allotted to each of them ten volumes, and concluded that 650 volumes was the total of surviving volumes in a century, and he went on to ask - 

 " **British** possession " shall mean any part of the King's dominions exclusive of the United Kingdom, and where parts of such dominions are under both a central and a local Legislature, all parts under thecentral Legislature shall for the purposes of this definition be deemed to be one **British** possession : 
Has he read the article recently published in the  Sydney Morning Herald,  concerning the position of **British** and French settlers in the New Hebrides, including the following statement attributed to a prominent French official at Vila, viz., " We have cause to be very thankful to your Commonwealth Government for imposing their Tariff on the products of their subjects in the New Hebrides, as it profits us not a little, especially so in the case of coffee " ?

* Is it a fact, as asserted by many persons familiar with the conditions of settlers in the New Hebrides, that in order to escape ruin from the operations of the Commonwealth Tariff, and participate in the trade advantages afforded to French settlers by the French Government, many **British** settlers have transferred their allegiance from the **British** to the French flag?

* What were the estimated numbers respectively of **British** and Australian' settlers in the New Hebrides in the years igoi-2-3-4-5-6 anil 7?

* As far as can be ascertained what are the total numbers of **British** and French settlers respectively at the present time?

* In view of the importance, from a naval as well as a commercial point of view, of effective **British** occupation of the more important islands of the New Hebrides group, as well as of other islands in the Southern Pacific, will the Government seriously consider the advisability of encouraging **British** settlement in those islands by rebating the whole, or the major portion at least, of duties on **British**-grown products ?

* As far back as i86r  Sir Henry  Parkes proposed that there should be an Australian Navy, but, as he grew in experience, he abandoned that idea and favoured the policy of a squadron provided and maintained by the **British** Government, the people of Australia paying a subsidy in consideration of the squadron being added to and kept efficient.

* This was the total cost as estimated 'by the **British** Government, who urged on  Sir Edmund  Barton that Australia should pay half.

* The **British** Government estimate the cost of naval defence on a system, taking into account the value of the trade they have to protect.

* Now, half the cost of the' protection of half of our total trade is practically one-quarter of the cost of the **British** Fleet in Australian waters; and yet the **British** Government, under the new arrangement, have offered to pay us 250,000 per annum.

* No thanks are due to the **British** Government, who are simply defending the Britisher's trade here as they would wherever the flag flies.

* At the end of last year, and notably at the beginning of this, there was a wave of enthusiasm throughout Australia in favour of increasing the strength of the **British** Navy in the North Sea, because the Continental countries were waking up to the fact that if they could get more first class battleships they would make themselves really more powerful than Great Britain.

* The authorities then began to wake up to the fact that the **British** sailor was evidently not a marksman.

* The matter was investigated, and a newspaper was established in England to advocate the neces- sity for greater efficiency in target practice on **British** warships.

* The Argentine is the only place where the **British** were beaten, and never went back for their flag.

* The **British** Admiralty say that the maintenance of the present squadron on this station costs 900,000 odd a year.

* The **British** Government would find the money at 3 per cent., and spend it here.

* This proposal could be made sound by continuing the policy to which the Colonial Premiers were a party in ;i886, allowing the **British** Government to raise the money at  3  per cent., which would save us from having to pay  31  per cent.

* I do not agree with those who say that, because we are going under the Government proposal to pay back the money borrowed in a given number of years, the **British** Government is finding the money.

* That was the position of the **British** Government.

* In Canada the **British** preference duty is  22  per cent., the intermediate duty32 per cent., and the general Tariff 35 per cent., the latter of which may be taken as representing, perhaps, 2d.

* The discussion of a scheme of **British** Imperial Federation, with a view to its actual realization, would lead to practical results only if carried on between perfectly independent autonomous powers.

* I believe that is the highest ideal that we can place before ourselves, and that is also the ideal that in its essence inspires the **British** people.

* The honorable member for "Kennedy referred to the time when the **British** feeling towards the colonies was that they might well be allowed to go their own way, or as Tennyson puts it, their cry was - 
We know that a change has come over the spirit of **British** statesmen in regard to the colonies.

* The principal object of the squadron will be, not to afford protection to our floating commerce, but to hold itself in readiness to co-operate with the other **British** war vessels in the Eastern seas.

* We know that the French Squadrons in the East and in the Pacific are being organized and mobilized, and strengthened so that they will be more powerful than any single **British** Squadron on any station that could be opposed to them.

* I recognise that there is an absolute necessity for freedom of action on the part of **British** war vessels in these and the neighbouring seas, because the various squadrons must be concentrated where they are likely to be most needed.

* I do not think that any attempt is being consciously made on the part of the **British** Empire to deprive us of our self-governing powers, but the agreement certainly makes in that direction.

* Will not the same thing happen in **British** New Guinea ?

* in the **British** Protectorate of Sierra Leone.

* This article was written for the purpose of appealing to the higher Christian sentiment of **British** communities in regard to the great injury which is&lt; being done by the vanguards of civilization in introducing the drink curse to primitive races.

* We withhold those privileges from the white population in **British** New Guinea, but we say to them : " You shall have what has been denied to the people in the States on the mainland, namely, the right to determine the extent of the liquor traffic within certain bounds."

* That this House feels bound in the present' grave crisis to express its profound indignation at the cruel and wanton attack recently made by a Russian fleet upon **British** fishermen whilst they were engaged in their peaceful calling.

* House fully sympathizes with the **British** Government and people in the demand that those who directed this outrage be punished.

* In this, as in many other matters, we were misled by the press reports, and we now know that there was no intention on the part of Russia to put an affront on the **British** people or to injure **British** subjects.

* Then, in 1899, the Boer war broke out, and all the Colonies interfered in the way of sending contingents to South Africa, in order to assist the **British** Government in a matter which did not directly affect Australia.

* In 1902 a Commonwealth Contingent was despatched to South Africa, and two resolutions were passed by this Parliament which distinctly interfered with parties in **British** politics.

* It will be remembered that  Sir Henry  Campbell-Bannerman, as leader of the Opposition in the **British** House of Commons, had condemned what he called the "methods of barbarism" adopted in the conduct of the war by the establishment of concentration camps, &amp;c He may have been right, or he may have been wrong; but the fact remains that we passed a resolution protesting, against these slanders, and affirming the readiness of Australia to give all requisite aid to the mother country, in order to bring the war to an end.

* We all know that the Legislature of **British** Columbia, after the Commonwealth Constitution had been carried by the vote of the people of Australia, forwarded its congratulations, although the expediency of adopting this Constitution was much in debate in Australia.

* Further, .**British** Ministers have actually invited the approval of this House  m  regard to  certain matters.

* What right, then, has the right honorable gentleman to say that the **British** Parliament, through its Ministers, does not interfere in our affairs?

* That measure was actually refused the Royal assent upon the advice of a **British** Minister, and his despatch upon the subject was commended to the notice of this Parliament by the same **British** Minister in 1901.

* Not only do **British** Ministers interfere with our measures and our actions, but the **British** Houses of Parliament adopt and pass resolutions relating to affairs in foreign countries which' are beyond their jurisdiction.

* If upon non.-**British** - that is, foreign - affairs such as these, the **British** Parliament expresses its opinion upon humanitarian grounds, why may not the Australian Parliament voice its views upon a matter which affects the peace of the whole Empire?

* In 1882 both Houses of the Dominion Legislature petitioned the **British** Government in favour of Home Rule.

* If we desire to express our opinion to any person, we ought to address our communication to him; and, as we cannot address all the **British** electors, I propose that we should petition their ruler and head, namely, the King.

* As to the danger of our being snubbed by the **British** Government, I would point out that that is a very unlikely contingency, in view of our recent resolutions in reference to the employ ment of Chinese labour in the Transvaal.

* We all know that the present **British** Government are opposed to Home Rule.

* As **British** subjects, we have lost no right bv coming to Australia, except that of voting for the election of members to the **British** Parlia- ment.

* Any Ordinance of an extraordinary nature or importance, whereby the King's prerogative, or the rights or property of subjects of the King not residing in the Territory, or the trade and shipping of any part of the **British** Dominions, may be prejudiced.

* Any Ordinance authorizing the purchase of land by private persons, except from the Lieutenaut-Governor, or from purchasers from him or from the Administrator of the Possession of **British** New Guinea.

* He gave us an illustration of what would be the effect of this policy upon **British** trade.

* He pointed out the way in which he thought this proposal would be accepted by the **British** people, and finally, like other members of the Opposition who have urged the rejection of the motion, said that he would favour the granting of preference in another form.

* Year after year, however, as the result of subsidies granted to foreign shipping companies to carry goods into the markets of Australia and to capture the business formerly secured by **British** ships, the vessels of other nations have entered the Australian trade.

* Those products were formerly taken away by **British** ships.

* In spite of what may be said to the contrary, **British** trade is threatened all along the line, and by Germany even more than by America.

* I think, too, that the goods to which the preference applies should be goods carried in **British** ships, and what is still more important, they should be **British** goods, not merely goods imported into Great Britain and shipped thence to Australia.

* The Government proposal is to give preference to any goods shipped in **British** bottoms, no matter where produced.

* Even before Federation, I saw the need for ear-marking the goods of other countries, to prevent their importation here in **British** bottoms as **British** goods.

* I agree, too, with the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that the ships to which the preference applies should be manned by **British** seamen.

* I would not go to the length of compelling them to be manned wholly by **British** seamen, because that is impracticable.

* We might all support a provision requiring that a certain percentage of the crews of the vessels shall be Britishers, but to require them to be wholly **British** would be to make the preference nugatory.

* A certain percentage should be white **British** subjects.

* Is it not possible, even though **British** imports may have a preference of 10 or 12 per cent, that foreign countries, by me ms of shipping subsidies, and the reduction of profits, will still manage to compete?

* From 1813 to 1825, if the iron were conveyed in **British** bottoms it was admitted at a duty of6 10s.

* per ton, whereas if it were carried in other than **British** vessels it was subject to a duty of 7 18s.

* Then we find that  Mr. Robertson,  a member of the **British** Parliament made a memorable speech which was quoted by Henry Clay in 1832.

* That is how the manu facturer in any part of the **British** dominions is treated by this foreign competitor upon whose behalf honorable.

* They have to compete with more than the Canadian, the German, and the **British** manufacturers had to compete with when they were laying the foundation of the iron industry in their respective countries.

* J. P. Booth, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of **British** Columbia : -

* The Commonwealth wishes all prosperity to **British** Columbia and the Dominion.

* That paragraph shows clearly that he never dared to intimate a desire to give the Sovereign the title of Emperor over the **British** race.

* Its inclusion is as ridiculous as was the retention of the title " King of France " by the Kings of Great Britain for over three centuries after the **British** had been driven out of France.

* The name of "citizen" is honoured in all the white parts of the **British** Empire; but it cannot be claimed in India, because to be a citizen is to have the right of the franchise, and in India no one has that.

* I think that the matter of privilege arises with regard to this House, which arose in the **British** House of Commons when the Royal Titles Bill was before the Legislature.

* As far as  His  Majesty the King is concerned, I am as loyal a **British** subject as there is.

* (**British**), 30 per cent., (other) 40 per cent.

* The section would clearly apply if the citizens of that State were **British** subjects.

* There is certainly no evidence of it, and I feel sure that a referendum would show that the vast majority is opposed to a system which is antagonistic to every instinct of the **British** race.

* Surprise was expressed by members of the **British** Team that rifle shooting was so far advanced and so universal throughout Australia.

* It has been conceded by all that if Britain goes down, we must go down, and that if the **British** Navy loses its power we cannot stand.

* To do that we must have a navy equal to that of the **British** Navy.

* When, finally, they got into touch with **British** sentiment, and realized that the sound common sense of the political leaders of the Empire was against them, and in favour of the Fisher policy, they- changed their tune to "An Australian unit."

* I do not propose to quote from them all : but every one must recognise that the opinion of **British** statesmen is that Australian defence can be best effected, managed, and controlled by Australians, and that the old system favoured by a number of the Fusionists of throwing on the **British** Government the responsibility of providing for Australian naval defence, and making a contribution to the Imperial Exchequer, was op-posed to sound principles of responsible government.

* They recognised that the old Liberal cry of " No taxation without representation " applied in that matter as forcibly as it had ever done, and that it would not be long before those parts of the Empire which were asked to contribute largely to the cost of the **British** Navy would demand a voice in the expenditure of the money which they contributed.

* I have here a short quotation from that eminent **British** Admiral to this effect - 
The elf -governing Dominions can best help us, not by spending ^2,000,000 in the construction of battleships to serve in **British** quarters, but by making efforts to 'defend themselves.

* It expresses a large measure of **British** sentiment.

* That was the position which obtained until **British** common sensecameto the rescue, and made it imperative that the Labour policy should be the policy of the Empire Honorable members opposite who fomented this feeling with a view of securing a political advantage, are now seeking to carry out the very policy which they then condemned so strongly.

* When there was trouble between Russia and Japan, the Russian commerce destroyers - not their large fighting vessels - began to overhaul **British** merchantmen, and to act in a manner calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.

* I believe that modern civilization owes a great deal to the talent, the energy, and the progressiveness of the **British** and the German peoples.

* Australian selfpreservation and patriotism are not necessarily antagonistic to **British** or Empire preservation or patriotism ; but may, and should be, their complement.

* That is, it necessarily leaves to the **British** Navy the providing of large cruisers.

* It relieves the **British** Navy of harbor defence, while at the same time it provides the Navy with an effective base.

* I strongly object to any further reduction, even in favour of **British** goods.

* That was not preference; it was simply another method of taking the bread out of the mouths of the **British** working men.

* In order to show what the opinion of the **British** working men and the Labour Party in the old country is on this matter, I shall take the liberty to quote from a report which appeared in the Melbourne  Argus  of the 2nd of this month as follows :  - 
In this document the declaration is made that it is time the **British** working man protested against the absurdities of the contentions of some of the colonial Premiers.

* This shows exactly the feeling of the **British** working man, whatever may be the feeling of the working man in Australia.

* of the total **British** trade.

* fewer unemployed, the cost of every necessary article consumed by the **British** ' workman would be increased.

* Needless to say," the manifesto sneeringly remarks, "one of the chief objects of the Premiers is the welfare of the **British** workman.

* The manifesto states that **British** workmen do not think they are called upon to contribute to the maintenance of children beyond the sea to this tune, nor are they to be entrapped by those who exploit the Imperial sentiment in the interest of tariff reform at their expense.

* He would have offered a true preference which the **British** workman could accept with open arms.

* If it were not for the Naval Agreement we should have fewer **British** warships in our waters.

* The first object of the **British** authorities is to make the North Sea safe, and to thoroughly fortify the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland.

* He was an officer who two years ago was appointed Chief Justice of **British** ^ New Guinea.

* It is proposed under this clause to take power to fix a date after which paymentin **British** coins other than gold shall not be legal tender in Australia, and' to determine the denominations of Australian coins to be made and issued.

* as I should like, but at the same time it will confer appreciable benefits, and will give **British** manufacturers a good margin to work upon.

* If the proposed concessions are made, they will indicate to the **British** people that Australia is prepared to reciprocate with the mother country.

* I have had something to do with endeavouring to obtain a reduction of the **British** wine duties, and I know something about the subject.

* There will be ample room for an increase of **British** imports under the preferential arrangement proposed.

* The preference given to **British** goods over foreign products ranges from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent.

* The revenue would fall in proportion, as the preference led to the greater displacement of foreign goods by **British** products.

* Our total imports from all sources, exclusive of bullion, are valued at about 37,000,000, of which **British** imports represent 23,000,000.

* The **British** farmer should protect himself.

* On the contrary, I know that nothing of the kind would take place, as we should supply without a **British** duty.

* I believe that questions of defence must necessarily assume an Imperial aspect so long as we remain a part of the **British** Empire, and I am certain that it is the desire of this Parliament, and of the vast majority of the people of the Commonwealth, to remain a part of the Empire.

* In the light of what has happened, however, it will be absolutely necessary for the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with the question of immigration again, and to liberalize the law so that no white **British** subject coming to Australia to work at an honest trade shall be prohibited from landing.

* Now the impression prevails abroad that Australia does not extend a hearty welcome to **British** workmen.

* But the Government have broadcasted to the world a notification that Australia does not welcome **British** workmen - - that Australia is in  no  need of population.

* and if I am not mistaken he then intimated that he was prepared to grant an unconditional preference to the **British** Empire.

* I appeal' to honorable members on the protectionist side as to whether they do not think that the Tariff is a sufficient obstacle to interpose against all goods coming from any part of the **British** Empire.

* The obstacles which the Tariff interposes to the free importation of **British** goods will still remain.

* Australia, I venture to say, would be overrun by the Eastern nations - I will not say that they would trench upon our cities ; I do not know that they would trouble themselves about that - but I do say that we should have had colonies of Japanese and of other Eastern nations in the back parts of Australia to-day but for the relations in which we stand to the great **British** Empire.

* It is due to the benevolent intentions of the rulers of Great Britain, to the Navy which is always at our disposal, and to the prestige of the **British** nation in the counsels of the world that we have been able to keep our shores free from the hordes of Asiatics who would else have undermined and defeated our civilization.

* Under it we are guaranteed our rights and privileges as citizens of the **British** Empire in any part of the world.

* We send our trade representatives to the East, and they are there under the protection of the **British** consuls.

* I say nothing of the protection of the **British** Navy.

* I, for one, am not anxious on that score, so long as the great **British** Navy continues to exist in its present state of efficiency.

* That, after all, is the great reason - because she is part of the great **British** Empire, part of the great family of which the Prime Minister spoke so eloquently upon the occasion of the last elections.

* I do not now refer to the kinship of race and blood, which I believe is as firmly cemented in even' part of the **British** Empire to-day as it has ever been.

* In clause 100, it is proposed to deal with **British** Possessions which have made certain provisions for the protection of trade marks on reciprocal lines, and my idea is that if we enter into any arrangement with foreign Powers we should do so upon a similar basis.

* It would be quite sufficient if we extended to foreign countries the powers proposed to be taken in clause 100 with regard to **British** Possessions.

* If the subsidized steamers of other nations have knocked out the American steamers, which have been protected, why have they not also knocked out the **British** steamers, which have not been protected?

* It seems absurd to think that the prestige which Great Britain has enjoyed for centuries in her control of the shipping trade of the world should be diminished by the act of dependencies in passing repressive legislation applying to **British**, as well as to foreign shipping.

* I am content that full inquiry should be made, with a view to ascertain how far it is possible to remedy the evils which arise from the unfair competition to which **British** vessels are subjected, by reason of the high subsidies paid by foreign Governments to foreign vessels.

* Quite recently a company has started to cater for the requirements of New South Wales in this connexion, introducing its oil from North **British** Borneo.

* Encouragement of the Australian shipping trade, and of employment of **British** subjects on board Australian ships.

* Employment of foreigners in **British** ships, both as officers and seamen.

* **British** ships subsidized or paying less wages to their crews than Australian ships.

* **British** ships not entering into the Australian coastal trade, but carrying pas sengers and cargo from Australian ports to any other ports outside Australia.

* Foreign ships not engaging in the coast in trade, but carrying passengers or cargo to any port in the **British** Dominions.

* We are of opinion in regard to 1 that provision should be made that no person other than a **British** subject should go as an officer of a **British**' ship sailing out of any port in Australia, and that of the whole ship's company not less than threefourths of the seamen should be **British** subjects.

* As to 11 (a) and  (b),  we are already of opinion that all vessels, whether **British** or foreign, which carry passengers or cargo from any port in Australia to any other port therein, should be treated without exception in the same manner, and come under the same laws and regulations,  i.e.,  whatever wages are paid in Australian ships' should bc paid in those ships, and whatever is required from the other classes of ships mentioned.

* Owing to the mileage bounty, the French competition against **British** vessels is exceptionallv severe in the long distance trade, and will be greatly felt  in the Australian trade, unless we take means to protect the local owners.'

* The report already quoted contains the following paragraph : - " The next contributory cause with foreign subsidies affecting **British** trade, is the reservation by foreign nations of their coasting trade to their own ships.

* Although **British** coasting trade is absolutely open to vessels of all nations, many nations reserve their trade between their own ports to their own vessels.

* A list of foreign countries, with particulars whether their coasting trade is reserved or open to **British** vessels, prepared by the Foreign Office, is printed in Appendix  (1902).

* This class of restriction appears to be on the increase, so that the field for **British** trading throughout the world is becoming gradually but surely circumscribed.

* Such restrictions have seriously affected **British** trade."

* The gist of this report of the Subsidies Commission, is that the adoption of sound principles and uniform laws applicable to the shipping of ali nations in **British** ports is necessary, and this statement has received large support from the shipowners of Great Britain.

* Thus the Liverpool Shipowners' Association, representing nearly 3,0001,000 tons of shipping, complain that they are handicapped, not only by the protection and assistance given to foreign competitors by the laws of their country, but also by the unfair advantage given to foreign ships in the home (that is **British**) ports; and it seems clear that this unequal contest must ultimately tell against **British** shipping in a serious way- 
Mr.Deakin.

* In the **British** North America Act there are but six sections devoted to the judiciary, and five of them are taken up with details which are disposed of in section 72 of our Constitution.

* Then again, although the judicial committee of the Privy Council as regards Canada, has given great satisfaction in its interpretation of the **British** North America Act, it has gradually established a line of interpretation in regard to that Act which is at present a safeguard to the Dominion Parliament and its powers.

* Putting aside the fact that the Canadian Constitution is a much less emphatic departure from the **British** Constitution than is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, where, instead of subordinating its provinces to itself, we have left them as relatively independent as are the States under the United States Constitution.

* When the sense of the equality of **British** citizenship has been borne home to the officially legal mind in England as it has been borne home already to political minds here and there, we shall probably .find these two tribunals united in one single Imperial Court of Appeal ; where the citizens within the United Kingdom and the citizens of the Empire without it will, alike obtain the final determination of important principles.

* Not only is there a federal veto upon provincial legislation in Canada, but there the provinces are reduced to the specific powers with which they are invested by the **British** North America Act.

* The **British** North America Act, like our Constitution, is an Imperial Act.

* Although all Acts of the Imperial Parliament stand legally upon the Same footing, it is more and more admitted that, constitutionally, there is a wide distinction between measures such as the **British** North America Act and our Constitution, which are the fundamental law of great self-governing communities and ordinary measures in regard to minor and formal matters of trifling concern which appear upon the statute-books side by side with them.

* The **British** North America Act does not contain within itself any power of amendment.

* One of its features which most struck its critics at home, and most amazed foreigners abroad was the fact that the Imperial Parliament had so lavish and absolute a trust in the people of this 
For the first time in **British** history the special and express sanction of the people appears in the preamble of an Imperial Act in addition to the sanction given by the Imperial Parliament and by the Crown.

* That of itself is sufficient to distinguish our Constitution from every other Act upon the Imperial statute-book, including the **British** North America Act.

* The wording and the character of our Constitution, coupled with the power of amendment contained within it, and the peculiar sanction given in its preamble, make it more essentially and absolutely a charter of entire self-government than any other Act to which the **British** Parliament has assented.

* Without 

 -Mr. Bryce's statements are based upon his knowledge of the **British** people, and upon the history of the American Supreme Court.

* To-day the **British** Empire is at the meridian of its splendour, and not at its decline, but even its territories are not large enough to contain its system of jurisprudence.

* Whatever may be the fortunes of the **British** Empire as a political entity, the fate of its jurisprudence is as stable, and its future will be as permanent as that of Roman law.

* I do not deny that it might be a wise thing for our flotilla to be attached to the concentrated **British** Fleet on these seas, and even to proceed with it to a considerable distance from our coast to cope with the enemy.

* Consequently, if we have a land-locked navy, our submarines would possibly become unsuitable, because we could not rely upon the crews and officers being kept up to the highest state of efficiency, it is pointed out by Lord Tweedmouth that the higher ratings, even of the ordinary **British** seaman, take six years to gain, and that all officers serve eight years before they reach even the rank of lieutenant.

* As in the Navy we are making a new departure almost without a precedent, and new to all the Dominions of the Empire, so in connexion with our land forces it appears to the Government that the time has arrived for making a new departure of an equally marked kind, and of a type equally unprecedented under the **British** flag.

* The **British** Government have gone to enormous expense to supply these ranges in the United Kingdom.

* We qualify him to achieve this end by putting him in training side by side with the best officers of the **British** Government in India and elsewhere.

* One of the many important features of the Conference in London was the scheme which  Mr. Haldane,  as head of the **British** Army, laid before us, when he invited us to send our officers to the General Staff, there to be received as comrades, to be shown the whole of the operations of what is often termed the brain of the Army, to be tried by being placed in positions of command, and to have thrown open to them for their benefit everything that was being done.

* In the same way, we hope to establish a General Staff of our own to which the **British** Government will send its officers to observe what we are doing, to learn something of operations in vast areas of sparsely settled country which they cannot expect to find in Europe, and also to give us the benefit of their knowledge and advice.

* I do not for a moment say that in our time coastal defence can take' the place of the **British** fleet.

* It is recognised at once that if the **British** fleet were absolutely defeated a torpedo defence would not be of much avail.

* the event of war, the **British** squadron will, for strategical reasons, be taken away from our shores.

* From the point of view of protection of **British** interests, I have nothing to urge against that.

* No doubt Ave could rely upon the **British** Navy to speedily account for the enemy when he met him, but our trade might be paralyzed by the sudden appearance of a few raiders that had escaped the vigilance of the **British** Fleet.

* Any money contribution we might make towards the **British** naval expenditure would be so small in comparison with the total that it would be hardly worth considering.

* With the knowledge that steam-ships, possessing cold storage accommodation, and capable of carrying- our produce to the **British** markets, will call at certain prescribed times, new industries arise.

* The measures which have been adopted for the restriction and control of alien immigration in foreign countries and in **British** colonies.

* I do not propose to pursue that subject now, but it is a matter requiring consideration at the hands of not only this portion of the Empire, but of the **British** Empire generally, as to how far we are justified in allowing that sort of thing to go on without reprisals of some sort.

* During the debate it has been urged by several honorable members that if our proposals were carried, and' the Court so extended an award as to include foreign ocean-going vessels, the foreign owners, as distinct from the **British** owners, would apply to their Governments, probably with success, for an increased subsidy to meet the extra expense entailed upon them, whereas the **British**-owned vessels would have no chance of securing any such com pensation.

* Consequently, the foreign shipowners would be able to surmount the difficulty created by the new conditions imposed upon them, whereas **British** ship-owners would be placed at a still greater disadvantage.

* I admit that that argument has had some weight with me, and that it would not be proper to run the risk of placing the **British** ship-owners at a disadvantage in comparison with foreign-owned vessels engaged in the coasting trade of Australia.

* In order to prevent the provision from apr plying to **British** vessels which receive mail subsidies, we propose to exclude them, and to make it apply only to- ships receiving subsidies from foreign Governments.

* A somewhat similar proposal was embodied in the Navigation Bill introduced in the Senate, but whilst that provision sought to impose disabilities upon subsidized vessels, it drew no distinction between **British** and foreign ships.

* We have been told that last year the revenue derived from the sale of lands and leases in **British** New Guinea was approximately 700.

* I desire to know the total area of land that has been sold or has been put under contract for sale since the Possession came under **British**, occupancy.

* To-day the Boers are able to offer a very stern and strong resistance to, I suppose, some of the best soldiers the world has ever seen, because they have been trained to use a weapon which, I believe, is superior to the weapons with which the **British** forces were armed.

* But if we had a navy such as we would be able to institute at the present time, we would be still liable to that, even though we were protected by such a force of the **British** navy as the Imperial Government could afford to send for the protection of Australian shores.

* As a matter of fact, does any man believe that Australia - since she has elected to take the part, for good or for ill, of standing by  the  mother-land - will ever- be permitted to .stand out as though she were an indifferent, factor, entirely unconnected with the great **British** Empire?

* It is said that it will interfere in business j that it will be distasteful to the people, and that it is opposed to the **British** ideal.

* According to **British** ideas of justice, if there is one guilty man in a crowd, we ought not to shoot the crowd down in order to reach him ; even if there be ten guilty men, and only one innocent man in the crowd, we ought not, unless all other means have been exhausted, to shoot that innocent man with the guilty.

* This is a practice which I venture to consider has been adopted for many - well, almost as long as we can recollect, and which is taken from the **British** practice obtaining in the United Kingdom, and has followed us here to Australia.

* I find from Imperial statistics that while in the period from 1884 to 1904 the total emigration of **British** subjects and foreigners from **British** ports increased from 303,000 to 453,000, the proportion of that number directed to New Zealand and Australia actually diminished from 46,000 to 14,000.

* Is it proposed  to impose rates high enough to keep out **British** goods, and then to increase them by 5 or 10 per cent, in respect to foreign goods?

* Other **British** communities are nearer to us in respect to policy and conditions; than is Great Britain.

* Both protection and free-trade are logical policies, but protection could not be effective if the duties that were imposed kept out foreign goods only, allowing **British** goods to be imported.

* Another thing to be remembered is this : It is to be presumed that the desire of preferentialists is to assist **British** manufacturers.

* It is a sensible and patriotic thing to wish .to help **British** manufacturers.

* But how much of the goods manufactured in and exported from Great Britain are made entirely from **British** products?

* The **British** Government would hesitate about placing Excise officers in every factory in the United Kingdom to see that our preferential provisions were not being evaded.

* The Treasurer desires to assist **British** manufacturers.

* It seems to me that the honorable member for Lang misses the point of the objection to this petition, which is that a right which **British** communities have long enjoyed has, in this instance, been apparently abused, and if notice is not taken of the matter, it will tend to bring the practice of petitioning Parliament into still greater disrepute than it is in at the present time.

* The number respectively of **British** and French subjects resident in the New Hebrides at the present time?

* The amount and value of the products of **British** subjects imported annually into Australia up to 30th June, 1906?

* In short, instead of being merely an Excise Board to regulate prices, it is to be something in the nature of the **British** Board of Trade, and having, perhaps, an even wider scope.

* I protest as strongly as I am able against any **British** contract immigrant having to explain to the Minister all the particulars of any private arrangement which he may have made, so long as there was nothing in the contract detrimental to the interests of the country.

* If the honorable and learned member for Indi thinks that the **British** people will attach the slightest importance to so absolutely abstract and academic a motion as appears on the businesspaper, he is looking through the wrong end of the telescope.

* I do not see what urgency there is for prolonging the debate any further to-night, seeing that the Prime 
Is the Minister of Defence aware that the Labour Government had decided to accept a **British** tender for the equipment of the small-arms and ammunition factory?

* .- I have listened carefully to the objections to the amendment, and desire to point out in justification of it that we have from the first been led to believe by those responsible for the proposal to grant a preference to **British** imports that it is  necessary  at the present time to take a step which will have the effect of bringing the outlying portions of the **British** Empire into closer relation with the .mother country.

* It is admitted that at a time of national danger we should have to rely upon the **British** mercantile marine to assist the Navy ; but my honorable friends opposite suggest that it is immaterial whether or not we do anything ' to improve conditions which are described on all sides as being so lamentable.

* It appears to me that some honorable members are prepared to discriminate in favour of one section of the **British** people, but not in favour of another.

* Throughout this measure we have discriminated between white foreign workmen and white **British** workmen.

* is admitted that this Bill will give a preference to the products of white **British** workmen as against those produced by white foreign workers, and it cannot be denied that we are giving a preference to **British** ships as against foreign ones.

* It certainly was not the intention of the framers of this Bill that any considerable preference should Le granted to foreigners, but we have given **British** ships a preference over foreign vessels, notwithstanding that the latter may be manned by Britishers.

* We have discriminated to such, an extent that I feel I am justified in urging that we should enact that the proposed preference shall be granted only to goods brought out in **British** vessels manned by **British** crews.

* The right honorable member for East Sydney urged that the son of an American father and a **British** mother born in the United States would be excluded under the provisions of this amendment.

* That is because certain legislation has offered a special inducement to foreigners to secure employment in the **British** mercantile marine.

* We have not safeguarded the employment of men of our own race in the **British** mercantile marine as the French and Germans have done.

* I believe that in many cases, when an opportunity to secure foreign sailors presents itself, **British** seamen are put aside.

* I do not know 'the reason for this preference, unless it is that, until they secure a safe footing, foreigners do not seek to impose so many conditions as do **British** seamen, and that they have hitherto been freer from the influence of trade unionism.

* I think the explanation is to be found in the fact that the foreign seamen at first give ships' officers a little less trouble than **British** seamen do.

* Surely it is not too much to say that vessels carrying the imports which will be affected by these preferences - imports which we are told are of the annual value of about 700,000 - shall employ only white **British** seamen.

* Should the Committee not agree that preference should be given in respect to only goods carried on vessels manned exclusively by Britishers, I shall test its feeling in regard to a proposal that it shall be given in respect to only goods imported on **British** vessels manned by white seamen; because where Australian expenditure is involved, I think that we should see that our money goes only to white persons.

* A responsible duty lies in front of this officer, for at present the Commonwealth does not stand well in the eyes of the **British** public.

* But if we are to restore the confidence of the **British** public in the Commonwealth, we must have a representative in London to protect and push our interests.

* .- I regard the provision that the importations in respect to which a preference is given must come here in **British** ships as most shortsighted, and inimical to **British** interests.

* As was plainly pointed out by an English Royal Commission which reported on the matter a few years ago, the best way to encourage the manning of **British** 'ships by Britishers is to offer better wages than are now paid.

* It is because the wages on **British** ships are higher than those paid on foreign ships that foreigners are so ready to enter the **British** mercantile marine ; but these wages are not as good as, during the last twenty or thirty years, Britishers have been able to secure on land.

* The London  Times,  in its new zeal for protection, beginning with preferences, a few years ago appointed a Commissioner to inquire into the effect which the policy originally proposed by the Government would have upon **British** trade.

* After pointing out that more than half of the carrying trade of the world is done by **British** ships, he had to admit that - 
So important a change as that of a system of preference may involve gravest dangers .to **British** shipping.

* A  change in the **British** fiscal policy on the lines of  Mr. Chamberlain's  proposals would be a great and growing benefit tQ  about 32 per cent, of **British** shipping, would injure 47 per cent., and would have little or no effect upon 14 per cent.

* It shows that **British** vessels constitute 91 per cent, of the shipping with cargoes and 76 per cent, of the shipping in ballast between the United Kingdom and the colonies and possessions.

* In the coasting trade of the United Kingdom 99 per cent., and of the colonies 96 per cent, of the tonnage with cargoes is **British**.

* These figures show that not much is to be gained bv requiring that the imports in regard to which a preference is given must be in **British** ships, since nearly the whole of our imports now come in **British** ships, even though part of them may have come originally from foreign ports.

* When the matter was originally under discussion, I pointed out that, unless there is a change of date, several vessels - among them an Italian vessel - now earning **British** goods from Great Britain would be prejudicially affected.

* In 1900, of the total tonnage employed in the foreign trade of Germany 26.9 per cent., of France 40.6 per cent, of Belgium 44.6 per cent., of Holland 41.7 per cent, and of the United States 55.8 .per cent, was **British**.

* Inasmuch as **British** vessels in some instances carry the bulk, and in nearly every case almost half of the foreign trade of other countries, the **British** mercantile marine affords an admirable target for retaliation such as the pro- vision now in the schedule might provoke, without benefiting to any appreciable extent the trade and commerce of the mother country.

* When he went on to say that we were compelled to choose between  the sacrifice of Australian industries to **British** manufac- 'tures or the exclusion of preference altogether, he again used a short and convenient summary justifiable in a few particulars, but wholly false when applied to industries generally grouped under a single title - as, for example, woollens, textiles, or iron - which in themselves embrace dozens of industries with special- products.

* No ohe  can  coerce the **British** Government into giving a sovereign for a shilling.

* Preference is as much our question as it is a **British** question, vet.

* although OVerwhelmed with invitations to Tariff Reform meetings, and often pressed to take part in other gatherings capable of bearing a party complexion, on no occasion did my colleague, the Treasurer, or myself attend anypart  meeting, or any meeting at which a. resolution affecting **British** party politics was proposed or carried.

* What we aim at is, as a **British** Minister put it,. "

* We asked for a reduction, either by the **British** Government itself - the possessor by means of a happy investment of an enormous interest in the Canal, from which it receives a superb return - or.

* Government was laid open to the members of the Conference, and even the Tariff now under consideration was, in its broad principles, outlined in advance so far as such a measure could be, by my colleague and myself to the **British** Ministers.

* We specially warned the **British** Ministers that we should be putting forward only one particular set of proposals, with a. full understanding that these would be merely the seed which might hereafter grow to something much greater.

* It is,, and will remain,  necessary  that at least the present amount of revenue should be obtained inAustralia, but this allows ample room withinwhich preference may be given to **British** imports.

* The immediate object of preference in our case would be to exclude foreign goods and to favour **British** goods.

* Sir Wilfrid  Laurier said - page  411  - that a complaint had been made -  that the Canadian preference has not done as much for **British** trade as had been hoped for.

* But again, I suppose, the **British** Government represented here may say, "No, we are not preparedto do that.

* He entered into most careful and elaborate calculations before we left this country, and, on my expressing doubt as to the estimate which he had formed, pointed out that he meant the estimate of  50  per cent, to apply to the circumstances which would arise if, in consequence of preference being granted for our agricultural products in the Mother Country, larger areas of land' were placed under cultivation in this country, a larger population found employment on the soil, the consumption of **British** goods brought here under preference being by that means increased.

* **British** goods under the stimulus of preference.

* _  
I call attention to it again, not as a matter of Complaint, but simply as a matter of fact - in these very preferential Tariffs that have -been the subject of discussion during the last few days there is not one of them which proposes to let **British** manufactures enter into the Colonial markets to compete on level terms with the Colonial manufacturer in regard to the class of commodities the production of which you think it your duty to encourage by protective duties.

* And quite rightly, from your point of view, if Imay say so 
No; but the point is that people here are invited to believe that in the Tariff now before the Committee we have departed- so absolutely from the principles laid down at this Imperial Conference debate, as to take the **British** Government by surprise.

* On the same page it willbe found that  Mr. Asquith  further said - 
You are not going to admit anybody, **British** or foreign, to compete on level terms in your markets in respect of the industries which you desire to protect.

* essential for your purpose", in the exerciseof your fiscal independence, and in the maintenance, as vou conceive it to be, of vour economic interests, to exclude the **British** manufacturers to a very large extent from your markets.

* My right honorable friend would have drawn tears from stones to-night by his picture of the grief and horror of the **British** Government when they discovered that we were raising the duties, not only against the foreigner, but against some **British** goods as well.

* Every week we have sent to us extracts from all the articles published in **British** newspapers affecting Australia.

* withdrawal would be a sheer, unmitigated loss to **British** trade.

* The more, we raise it the faster will **British** goods come in.

* There is no Tariff wall that has yet been erected, even in America, which is the highest of them all, which has succeeded in excluding, or ever will ' succeed in .excluding, **British** goods from a market, so long as **British** goods retain their pre-eminence in quality and adaptability to the needs of.

* It may be said that the **British** Government is indifferent to preferences offered to it. '

* Consequently, we have from the lips of the  President  of the Board of Trade a sufficient statement of appreciation from the **British** Government - by free-traders, who grant no preference, remember; by those who are usually supposed to attack preference.

* As his own agent pointed out, between 1901 and 1905 **British** imports to Australia fell by 13 per cent., whilst foreign imports to Australia rose by 11 per cent.

* The German railway is a bonus on exports ; the **British** railway is a bonus to the foreign exporter to this country.

* This means that the **British** preference hitherto granted by Canada will be reduced by exactly the amount of that intermediate Tariff to these two countries - one of them the most formidable competitor the Mother Country has.

* The Premier of Cape Colony has warned the **British** Government that the preferences granted there are being opposed by a portion of the people whom he represents, until reciprocity is conceded.

* It is true that we owe all he said, and more than, we can say, to the protection of the **British** flag and fleet.

* The most encouraging feature is that, on the part of the **British** people and its Parliament as a whole, there is to-day an even more generous spirit than has obtained hitherto.

* Before I conclude, mayI remind the Committee - as my honorable colleague has done in detail - that the preference proposed at present covers  15,000,000  worth of **British** goods, upon some lines of which, at all events, decided inroads have been made?

* The preferences proposed also cover 9,000,000 worth of goods from foreign countries, over all of which the **British** importer will obtain an advantage.

* This proposal for the establishment of an Imperial fund to be devoted to the encouragement of quick and cheap communication between the mother land and her oversea Dominions, or cheaper freight for **British** manufacturers, and cheaper freight for our producers here, cheaper cable messages, the lowering of canal rates, or in any other manner in which we could increase trade and intercommunication between the parts of the Empire - this proposal was first scouted and then ridiculed.

* The **British** Government has already subsidized ships to New York, arid", having done that, why not subsidize steamers to connect with their own Dominions, and make the route through Canada the quickest route to the East, and perhaps in the future to Australia?

* Let the right honorable member read  Sir Wilfrid  Laurier's statement of the impossibility of freetrade within the Empire, even if the **British** Government offered it - let the right honorable gentleman read the admission of **British** Ministers that free-trade within the Empire is impossible from their point of view, even if we wished it - and he will no longer discuss that question.

* He pointed out that France was within seventy-five miles of the **British** coast, and that that country was the nearest from which an army of invasion could be despatched.

* I do not know whether we have the right to measure the Courage of our opponents by our own, or the readiness of their leaders to take resp'onsibility by that of **British** officers; but I am .certain there is no admiral in our Fleet who would willingly undertake a task such as I have endeavoured to describe.

* No **British** admiral would regard the Convoying of vessels carrying  70,000  men across at least seventy-five miles of sea, and their subsequent protection for two days and two nights in_ positions not only fixed, but  perfectly  ascertained, in waters swarming with torpedo craft and submarines, as other than the enterprise of a lunatic.

* And what a **British** admiral would regard as insane is scarcely likely to be considered as practicable by sailors of other nations.

* The dominant fact of our defence is that we have the **British** Fleet supreme upon the seas, and long may it remain so.

* At the same time, we have been warned again and again, that the **British** Fleet, including the vessels of the so-called Australian Squadron, may be drawn away from Australia for the purpose of attacking an enemy in other places.

* We have a very efficient police in the **British** squadrons stationed in various parts of the world ; but, at the same time, we should not be prevented from employing an efficient night watchman, at our own expense, to guard our premises.

* No expedition, whether despatched from an enemy's base in the Eastern seas or from Europe, could hope to reach its destination until the **British** Navy had been definitely worsted.

* It is stated by MajorGeneral Hutton that no expedition could hope to reach its destination -until the **British** Navy had been definitely worsted.

* Now, however, they are employed in the **British** Navy.

* I would remind the Attorney-General that, as a matter of fact, there are a very large number of people in the **British** Isles who cannot speak a word of English.

* Whether the **British** Government will take any serious notice of such a protest remains to be seen.

* I do not know whether the Government are prepared to accept the amendment of the honorable member for 
Whether the Commonwealth Government could appoint such a representative under its power of authority in "external affairs " without the previous sanction of the **British** Government ?

* Whether all present communications with the Javanese authorities do not have to proceed through the cumbrous and distant channels of the **British** Colonial Office and **British** Foreign Office ?

* When did he receive the last communications from the **British** representative in Java as to the influx of.

* I understand that the arrowroot growrnin the French settlements is admitted free to France and other French possessions; whereas the **British** missionaries are placed at a disadvantage, inasmuch as on the arrowroot they produce they have to pay a duty when it enters the Commonwealth.

* I believe it was in 1883 that the **British** House of Commons, of 630 members, declared by a majority of145 that it was not absurd that a quorum of the House should consist of three members.

* Fancy three members being entrusted with the destinies of the whole **British** Empire !

* Direct taxation is 'coming in England, and we shall soon have to follow the **British** example.

* When we come to have a land tax, I hope that it will be cumulative, so as to cause our lands to be available to the native-born, and thus carry out the desire of the honorable member for Ballarat to throw open our country to all white persons, but preferably to those of the **British** race, with precedence to Australians.

* At the time when this debate was adjourned last Friday, I was alluding to the fact that the London County Council and the **British** Government, besides a large number of.

* municipal bodies and county councils in England, and a large number of other bodies, all in **British** speaking communities, have adopted the principle which I advocate in this motion.

* Would a Liberal like Lloyd-George propose to borrow to pay for a  Dreadnought)  The **British** Liberals do not borrow for these purposes.

* Such being admitted, it is therefore evident that so long as Australia seeks further money from the London market, either fo, new undertakings or for renewing old Joans, attention will have to be paid to the opinions of the **British** investor on certain political matters.

* It must be confessed that the difference in the attitude of the **British** investor towards Australia can be accounted for only on the  supposition  of mistrust arising from considerations, not of the resources of the States, but of their politics.

* They show that equally with other advanced and progressive portions of the world - our sister communities under **British** rule - we have nothing whatever to fear in the future.

* It is quite in opposition to any of my ideas of the principles of our Constitution, or of any similar constitution upon the **British** pattern, to establish a consultative body to deal with the large measures with which this Parliament alone has the right to deal.

* I remember that a few weeks' ago the honorable member was a member of a conference at which it was urged that a preference should be given to **British**) goods.

* Is not this monstrous hypocrisy - to urge that there should be a preference on **British** goods, whilst refusing to  give  a preference to Australian workmen as against Austrians and Italians?

* Although he is prepared to vote for preference to **British** goods, he admits that in conducting the affairs of his company he thinks there should be no differentiation whatever between Austrians, Italians, and Australians.

* I am one of those who have hitherto been proud of belonging to the **British** race.

* I recognise, as we all must do, if we are thoughtful students of the social system, the many evils that exist, not only in the United Kingdom herself, but in the various' States of the **British** Empire, which are constantly agitating for the reform of abuses.

* Yet, comparing the **British** people with the people of other countries and races, we find a reason for being proud of the **British** Empire.

* I cannot believe that the **British** Government will be so " touchy " as to quibble and quarrel about the wording of our resolution.

* The fact seems to have been overlooked that of all the nations in the world the **British** nation has been the most meddlesome - that our readiness to interfere in every part of the world has become, so to speak, our special characteristic.

* And I see no reason why the **British** nation should not interfere, when it is actuated by a creditable feeling of indignation at injustice, whether it occur in Armenia or elsewhere?

* There is no people who possess to a greater degree the capacity for self-government, and it is public spirit which stimulates the indignation of the **British** race against all injustice, even though we may be told that it is not our business to interfere.

* We should not have advanced in civilization if that had not been the characteristic policy of the **British** people, It is the impulse to denounce wrong which leads to the evolution of civilization.

* In the London  Times  of the 16th January the following paragraph appeared : - 
Does it not occur to you what a bitter piece of irony it is that this situation has been brought about by action in which **British** colonists took a fighting part - **British** colonists who iri their own countries, in Australia and other colonies, will not allow the Chinaman to set his foot?

* The **British** Empire, in taking control of the Transvaal, should see that that country is developed in the best way, and that the best conditions are set up by the Government.

* A great point was made of the establishment of justice under the **British** system of colonization, by which the confidence of native populations was secured.

* The confidence of the native is secured when he realizes that, instead of being under the will of a chief, or of anybody else, he has only to enter a **British**' Court to secure justice.

* It was claimed that that is the real reason for the success of the **British** race in colonizing countries inhabited by such people.

* The Empire owes a duty to the coloured people in the Transvaal, if the high character of **British** policy in the government cf uncivilized people is to be maintained.

* The whole thing is a plot, and I say that England requires to clear herself of the suggestion that the Boer war was undertaken for this particular object, and it is our duty to stimulate the **British** authorities to do so.

* I have no desire to repeat what has been said already as to the necessity of peopling the Transvaal with men and women of the **British** race.

* desire that the **British** people shall' maintain the high position they hold amongst the nations of the world; but I should like to know what is going to follow if Chinese are introduced to the Transvaal, and Great Britain should again need our help in any difficulty.

* The difference of opinion arises from the fact thatsome honorable members think that it would be safer if we were not to undertake any responsibilities that Great Britain has taken up in annexing part of New Guinea as **British** territory.

* I am not one of those members who think that we can possibly and honorably take up an attitude of nonliability concerning any of the islands of the Pacific, and especially as to the **British** part of New Guinea.

* The honorable member's argument had only one conclusion, namely, that the Commonwealth should not take possession of **British** New Guinea, or, in other words, if I understood him correctly, that the Commonwealth should provide for the cost of the administration of the possession, but that Great Britain should govern it.

* The Imperial authorities have announced through the Secretary of State for the Colonies that they desire to be free from the responsibilities of **British** New Guinea, and they are following up a line of policy which was not palatable to the Australian people in 1884.

* In 1888 they annexed only that part of the island now known as **British** New Guinea, after a guarantee had been given by colonial statesmen then in Britain that Australia would contribute to the cost of management.

* I had the advantage of being for some time a member of the Queensland State Parliament, where there has never been any doubt as to the position in regard to **British** New Guinea.

* Neither Germany or Holland are reaping from their operations in New Guinea benefits to the extent which Australia is receiving from the **British** possession, and we are much more likely to come to terms with them, which would enable us to obtain the whole island as a **British** possession, than we should be if we were to take any action other than that proposed by the Government.

* Further proposals have been made, as will be found upon reference to the Report of **British** New Guinea for the year 1st July, 1899, to 30th June, 1900.

* Le  Hunte's report it is set forth that - 
That condition was imposed after the attempt made by **British** speculators to obtain possession of a large portion of the island - these applications were at once notified to them ; and official intimation has since been received by this Government, to its great disappointment, of the intention of the Government of New South Wales to oppose both.

* In view of the fact that attempts are being made to secure large tracts of land in **British** New Guinea - the land is admitted to be good in many instances - and that there is a large population under **British** control, it is of the greatest importance that the Commonwealth Government should secure possession of that country, and obtain possession of it in a way that will enable it to control its administration at the earliest possible moment.

* They have driven out the best English lines, because the **British** manufacturers keep to the sizes which they have been making from time immemorial, whereas the Americans make intermediate sizes, and thus cater better for the wants of the people.

* He stated further that, while the protected manufactures now in Australia must be left as they are, protective duties should not be imposed on **British** imports with the object of bringing into existence other manufactures.

* He remarked that the Australian people, like those of South Africa, must understand that it would be necessary for them to give a real preference to Great Britain by reducing the duties upon **British** goods, and thus encourage the interchange of **British** manufactures for the primary products of the Commonwealth.

* He urged that no attempt should be made to bring into existence further industries that would enter into competition with those of Great Britain, and cause a falling off in **British** imports.

* If it be desired to give preference to the old country, we should reduce our duties as against **British** imports instead of increasing the duties upon foreign goods, and so causing the consumers to pay high'er prices.

* In the same way, I am sure that the **British** manufacturers would take advantage of any opportunity we might afford.

* The position taken up by the Government with regard to the Papua (**British** New Guinea) Bill is not only unsound, but is based upon a frivolous objection.

* What are the intentions of the Government  1  If the Prime Minister returns, after the general elections, with a majority at his back - and it is very problematical whether he will do so - he will, I presume, test the feeling of the House again with regard to the nonalienation of land and the liquor traffic in **British** New Guinea.

* Who are the people who have come to the right honorable gentleman and urged him to obtain further information  1  They are the representatives of one of the biggest firms connected with the trade of **British** New Guinea - the firm that is likely to do the biggest trade there in the future.

* The Prime Minister admits that the two great reforms which have been carried with reference to **British** New Guinea - namely, land reform and liquor reform - have induced him to drop the Papua Bill.

* I  wish to say, in justice to a number of men engaged in mining in Western Australia, and whom I know personally, that the suggestion that **British** or foreign machinery is preferred to Australian, because the men who are working the mines are foreigners, or have come from Great Britain, is, in my judgment, without foundation.

* I would, therefore, propose an amendment to deal only with **British** subjects.

* ought to have special care for **British** subjects.

* While the extended principle may be logically correct, the others have not the same claims to our consideration as have **British** subjects.

* By omitting in sub-section 1 the words " except those born in Australia," and inserting in lieu thereof the words "except natural born **British** subjects," and 
If I thought that this agreement, as submitted to the House at the present time, were the initiation of a permanent Australian policy with regard to our naval defence, I do not think that even the considerations of convenience and propriety, that are inducing me to vote for it now, would secure my support for it.

* But it is because I consider that the circumstances of the Commonwealth to-day render it not only desirable but also necessary in the interests of Australia as a unit, as well as in the interests 'of Australia as part of the **British** Empire) that this agreement should come into force, that, after giving the matter careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that it is ray duty, at all events, to support the proposal practically as it is now submitted by the Government.

* After all, it is only when a great war takes place that these matters will become of serious importance to us, because it is only then that the whole strength of the **British** fleets will be called into use to maintain **British** influence and supremacy throughout the world.

* Concentration and unity of purpose is essential in every portion of the **British** Empire so Jong as the defence and benefit of one part is the defence and benefit of all.

* What is now the cry of the **British** Navy- it is not for construction programmes or for grants of money, but for men, men, men !

* Our **British** mercantile service is manned, I will not say wholly by foreigners, because that would be an exaggeration, but it is manned by foreigner's to an extent which is most injurious to **British** Naval supremacy.

* Of course we have had the protection of the whole **British** Navy all along, but we could not expect the **British** line-of-battle-ships to come here in order to protect our coasts.

* After all, in times of dire peril necessity is stronger than any written or spoken word, and if under the old agreement some great emergency had arisen which rendered it essential for the maintenance of **British** power - and that means our power - that our squadron should have gone off somewhere and left Australian shipping to look after itself, I should have said, " Go, and good luck to you."

* I believe that the **British** Admiralty and the  people of  England are as honest as ourselves, and that they will abide by the spirit of the agreement so long as the urgency of the case does not override the ordinary condition of affairs.

* These conditions are not embodied in the agreement under consideration, inasmuch as the proposed squadron may leave Australian waters, the contribution will exceed 126,000 annually, and the Pacific Squadron may be reduced or increased in any way that the **British** Government think wise, even to the extent of altogether removing it from Australian waters.

* Whilst we had an Australian Squadron, which was auxiliary to the **British** Squadron, in the Pacific, we always had the nucleus of an Australian Navy.

* The Prime Minister be invited to obtain all data necessary for the preparation of a measure granting a preference to **British** imports into Australia which compete solely with imports from foreign countries.

* We must ask ourselves in what sense are the **British** people an Empire?

* To that achievement we are addressing ourselves day by day in all the labours which we undertake, on the lines of the historical development of the **British** people.

* It is usually urged that the **British** workman, or the colonial purchaser, will have tp pay something more.

* With the limited object which I have in view, it becomes unnecessary to say more than that during recent years in Australia we have had before us the fact that, comparing **British** with foreign imports the gain has gone to the latter.

* There has been- a stage at which foreign imports have declined, but then **British** imports have declined still more.

* Anybody who knows from the direct relations of those who are engaged in shipping what is taking place at Singapore, must know that there, line after line of steamers has passed from the **British** flag to another flag.

* Singapore itself is virtually owned by the Chinese, while to-day, for every vessel leaving that port flying the **British** flag, I am assured that two or three vessels leave flying a foreign flag.

* I- do not criticise **British** politics.

* Who can limit the productive power of Australia in respect of the very produce which we desire to export, and for which the **British** markets are the best in the world?

* At present the whole of the **British** Empire does not produce more than one-third of the wheat which is purchased in Great Britain.

* If they were compelled by law, as they are in America under regulations, when building their ships, to think of the men who have to man them, and to provide proper sleeping and resting accommodation for them, there would be no danger of the **British** sailor abandoning our **British** ships.

* That is what we want in a **British** country.

* I am going to vote with my honorable friend, but not for a white Australia purely **British**.

* I would rather have it purely **British** because this is my home.

* I would rather that it were purely **British**, but we cannot have our boats manned entirely by Britishers until the steam-ship companies interested are prepared to give them decent pay.

* When the **British** in 1S33 freed 800,000 niggers in the West Indies, it was urged that the action was inopportune.

* Such a concession will not be worth anything in the eyes of the **British** public, and, seeing that that is so, and that the amendment will open the door to great dangers, I ask the Government whether it is worth while to accept it?

* The silver that was current here was **British** currency, which we accepted.

* If we are to have a coinage of our own, we must have a. distinctive design, and the **British** Government cannot allow vis to pour our silver into Great Britain if we do alter the design.

* Therefore, it would be absurd, on the face of it, to expect that Great Britain could make a profit out of sending her silver here, to a population which al-, ready has sufficient silver currency, although I admit that it is conceivable - but, as the honorable member for North Sydney says, it is not probable - that it might pay our Government to place a shipment of silver on the **British** market.

* I wish to mention, in passing, that the honorable member for Wentworth, among others, referred to the 
**British** Mint as the Imperial Mint.

* There is a tendency to use the words :' **British** " and " Imperial " as transposable terms, which they are not.

* We are going to get our coinage done in the **British** Mint, and not in the Imperial Mint.

* With regard to the contention that the silver coinage of Australia should be current in Great Britain, and  vice versa,  I am heartily in accord with one point which the honorable member for Parkes makes, that it would be in the last degree unfortunate that a proclamation should issue in such a way as to prevent the silver of **British** immigrants passing current in this country.

* It is a matter of practical politics ; and I feel sure that we shall do nothing to place any person intending to come here from the **British** Islands in such a position.

* It seems to me that in taking notice of the pinpricks of critics whose information entitles them to no consideration, and who have no great influence upon the welfare of the **British** nation, we are abandoning the traditional attitude of **British** people from time immemorial, and that it is a sign of deterioration when charges are hurled against us by the press of foreign countries, or when enthusiastic, though misled, persons in our midst raise stories which will not bear investigation, to fall into an hysterical condition in repudiating them.

* But I do not believe, and I should be sorry to think, that our people desire that the war should be carried to the bitterest conclusion, and that the terms made by the **British** Government with the Boers should be pushed to the last extremity, I will not say of justice, but of possibility.

* The attitude of the **British** Government can be learned only from the expressions of  Mr. Chamberlain.

* I believe that the position occupied by the majority of Australian people is rather that, while they are willing to make all reasonable sacrifices in order that the Empire may be triumphant, at the same time they are ready to consent to any terms which the **British** Government offer to the Boers.

* I do not think that there would be any objection if the **British** Government were to make the most lenient, terms to-morrow ; but the assumption that has been studiously put forward by some of the **British** press, and by one or two of the **British** Ministers, has been that Australia and the other colonies would not acquiesce in any such lenient treatment.

* It is for the **British** Government to determine the distance to which concessions should go, and I believe that the people in these States would back them up if they were to bring the war to a close to-morrow in that manner.

* I object most strenuously to the idea being put abroad sedulously that we are asking for more than even the **British** Government ask for - an impossible settlement.

* I should be quite prepared to support the second part of the motion if it indicated the extent to which it commits us in regard to furnishing men and money; and in order to counteract any misapprehension which may have got abroad in that regard I should prefer to see added to it a statement that we are quite prepared to accept any terms of settlement which would be agreeable to the **British** Government.

* I should prefer to see in this series of resolutions some indication that we are prepared to accept any settlement of the trouble which is satisfactory to the **British** Government.

* The result is that a distinct preference is given to a German as against a **British** salt.

* It will always leave the possibility of a loophole, by which some of these German salts may come in free as against **British** salt, which is dutiable at 20s.

* Whether we advocate or oppose a preference to the United Kingdom, I am certain that no honorable senator desires to grant a preference to German as against **British** goods.

* At any rate, speaking generally, I do not think that the Committee desires to grant a preference toforeign as against **British** goods, even if it is not in favour of granting a preference to the United Kingdom.

* I shall support the payment by the Commonwealth of an increased subsidy towards the cost of the **British** Navy, but I sincerely hope that means will be discovered in the near future for the realization to some extent, at any rate, of what I think everybody must admit is a natural aspiration on the part of Australians - the creation of an Australian Navy.

* As I said in the debate on the address in reply to the GovernorGeneral's speech, I am seriously afraid that the payment of a subsidy towards the cost of the **British** Navy is an arrangement which contains many elements of danger.

* They thought it advisable that Australia should be made a training ground for **British** seamen, and the Governments of the various States in the last thirty years have spent many thousands of pounds in attempting to give effect to the recommendations thus made to them.

* But it would be a great mistake for the various colonies to regard the **British** Navy as a sort of Empire police.

* It is true enough, and we all admit it, that the fate of the **British** Empire does not hang upon the inviolate security of colonial or even of **British** coasts, but Upon fleetpower at sea.

* Still, as the writer of the article from which I am quoting points out - 
If the **British** Empire were to fall to-morrow, the subjugation of, for example, Australia would not necessarily follow.

* That the contribution hitherto paid is insufficient the Australians freely admit, but they resist the idea of making a larger grant to the **British** exchequer upon the ground that the money expended by Australia for naval purposes should be devoted to providing an Australian contingent of ships, and manning them with Australians.

* They do not care to be protected by contract, as it were, and instead of subsidizing the **British** Navy they desire to have their own.

* I find from a dispatch by  Sir Arthur  Lawley, the Governor of the Transvaal, that the white population of that country are up in arms against the Legislative Council - so much so that he is afraid to use his majority in that Council to carry out the policy of the **British** Parliament.

* The present condition in which the expressed constitutional law upon this question stands is put in a sentence by Todd,, who, at page 254 of the second edition of his  Parliamentary Government in the **British** Colonies,  says - 
That is the dictum of 1894.

* In the only more recent book to which I propose to refer -  **British** Rule and Jurisdiction beyond the Seas,  by the late  Sir Henry  Jenkyns, with a preface by  Sir Courtenay  Ilbert, published in 1902 - the same doctrine is repeated without development - 
In the relations of one **British** possession to another, the Crown is the connexion between them.

* In Australia we have, without noticing it, been developing the relations between allied  communities under the Crown to perhaps a greater extent than they have been developed in any other part of the **British** Empire, by the natural and necessary communication which has- proceeded, and must go on, between communities separated only by imaginary lines, though under independent Governments.

* We still had open to us an appeal to the people of the country which will be chiefly affected by the introduction of these Chinese, and, through them, an appeal to the Parliament of the mother country and to the **British** Government.

* Australia., after years of experience, is convinced that practical prohibition of Chinese immigration is imperatively required in the best interests of the people of **British** communities, especially of those which enjoy or expect to enjoy the powers of responsible selfgovernment.

* In our opinion these documents demonstrate that the policy o.f the Chamber of Mines is directed to the perpetuation of the inferior race-labour system by the importation of Asiatics, and in one of oppositionto the growth of a large **British** working population.

* Or shall we say that national interests and humane considerations stand higher, that they ought to be placed more and more by the statesmen and by the people, who shall breed or become statesmen, in the forefront of their policy?Shall we not say that if we are anything we are a nation, and founders of nations yet to be within an Empire which is **British**.

* It is not **British** in the colour of all its subjects, but in the number of its white citizens,' who control it, who give it authority, force, and weight; whose character and courage sustain it in the day of battle as well as in its industrial tasks from hour to hour.

* The- Empire is great because it is **British**, and the stronger and more numerous our Britons, the stronger the Empire must become.

* Although you  may  be momentarily advantaged,  and  add to the wealth of many who have already too much, if you destroy the **British** manhood, the basis upon which the nation  Tests,  it will  fall.

* I was astonished to find that in every **British** possession, with the exception of Great Britain and Ireland, German trade had increased to a greater extent than had **British** trade.

* It would be a good thing if that were the law of the Commonwealth and of the **British** Empire.

* the number of **British** seamen engaged in our mercantile marine is seriously diminishing, and when we reflect that trouble may arise in Europe upon almost any day, surely it is about time that we looked round to ascertain if we are in a position to man our own ships.

* In view of what, we have done for the **British** Empire, it would have been a disgrace had not theFederal Government entered a protest at this juncture ' against the importation" of Chinese labour into South Africa.

* As a unit of the **British** Army I wish to say that I have a very high opinion of Major-General Hutton.

* If he ' were drafting these regulations for the **British** Army - and they are based upon **British** Army regulations - they might be necessary.

* I believe that they do work well at the present time in the **British** Army, but in the case of thosewho have to earn a livelihood, and who do soldiering only in their sparetime, it is impossible for either officers or men to become acquainted with the duties there laid down, let alone carry them out.

* As one who has made a close study of the history of the labour movement in Australia, I was surprised to hear the term " **British** justice " so highly lauded by the Prime Minister, especially in view of the fact that he must be acquainted with the struggles and martyrdom which have bean experienced in connexion with the trade union movement.

* To declare that justice is meted out in **British** Courts of law is to assume something which is not based upon fact.

* The term "**British** justice," in my, opinion, had better be entirely discarded.

* There has never been a word of complaint on this subject from the old country, but you can well understand,  Mr. McDonald,  the impatience of the people of the mother country when representatives of Australia go there and insist upon the whole foundation of her fiscal relations and policy being altered in order that the products of Australia may compete with those of **British** farmers.

* I feel that the attitude taken up by our representatives at Home in endeavouring to tear up the cherished Policy of the people of the mother country m order that Australian products might obtain free admission, and at the same time making professions of an honest desire to secure more power for **British** trade and **British** manufactures in the markets of Australia was a sham.

* The protectionist I blame is not the man who says, " We are building up our manufacturing industries, and not even for the sake of the mother country can we relax our attitude or open our ports to enable **British** manufactures to imperil the stability of our own protected manufactures."

* I can understand such a , position ; but I have an infinity of contempt for the man .who is determined to keep the door shut to **British** manufactures, and yet goes to the mother country and professes to be ready to open it, endeavouring to persuade the millions of the people of the old country under absolutely false pretences to put taxes on their" food supplies.

* It is, however, a cruel wrong to let the people of the mother country believe that Australian protectionists are ready to open the door and allow **British**' manufacturers to imperil the soundness of Australian protected industries.

* This item affords a better opportunity to test the question, since comparatively speaking, there are enormous imports of **British** blue, and the suggested preference of Jd.

* The Ordinances at present in force in **British** New Guinea absolutely prohibit the natives from having anything to do with intoxicating liquors.

* The result of the existing Ordinances, combined with the restriction containedin clause 43 of the proposed Constitution, will be that unless the consent of the Governor-General in Council is obtained, the natives will not be exposed to the liquor traffic; and therefore this proposal can only affect the white inhabitants of **British** New Guinea.

* Just as the white inhabitants of a State would be affected if this were a matter of State legislation, so it affects the white inhabitants of **British** New Guinea.

* Here we are, nearly five years after the institution of the Commonwealth, more than four years after this Parliament first met, more than three years after we have taken possession of **British** New Guinea, and still we are without n Constitution tinder which legislation for it can be passed in order that it may be developed on the lines which we desire.

* The proposal of the Government, which is a further grant of freedom to the white people to legislate for themselves, is a concession that ought to please honorable members who fought for a greater extension of the franchise on general matters to white inhabitants of **British** New Guinea.

* It is all very well for them to turn round and say - "Our Indian subjects are **British** subjects, and we have no right to interfere with them."

* It is very nice for the **British** people to say that when there is no fear of black labour going there.

* What has the **British** Navy done for our trade?

* protection of the **British** Navy ?

* That fleet cost the **British** taxpayer 2,500,000, which represents1s per head of our population, as against 15s.

* per head paid for the protection of our trade by the **British** workmen whose goods are not to be admitted here.

* TheAttorney-General has told the Committee that the amendment cannot be accepted, because the **British** manufacturer might take advantage of the preference held out to him, and dump goods in our markets in order to cripple our industries.

* I am in favour of bringing about preferential trade by reducing the duties on **British** imports, leaving the Tariff as it is on foreign imports.

* The duties on **British** imports must come down.

* If the provisions of the measure had the effect of increasing the duties upon **British** imports by 20 per cent., or upon colonial manufacturers to that percentage, we should to that extent reduce the income of our primary producers.

* Great Britain engages from time to time in numerous little wars in order to protect her extending trade, and our commerce, in common with that of all other parts of the Empire, is carried on under the protection of the **British** flag.

* the Treasurer in connexion with the preference he is prepared to give to the **British** manufacturer of blankets.

* Many of these natives were able, even before they went to Natal, to speak and write English fully up to the standard likely to be required by the officers administering this Act and one may travel through province after province in **British** India and find thousands of-men who would be able to pass a test similar to that now in.

* He told them that there was only one measure that would be acceptable to the **British** Government, and that was what is now known as the Natal Act.

* MiChamberlain was leading up to the determination which had been arrived at in Cabinet by the **British** Government to continue to refuse legislation to Australia, just as they are now doing to other parts of the world, such as Canada.

* Here we come to the old question that caused the **British** Government to be firm.

* It was not until objections were raised by the rajahs of India, and of Hindustan in particular, from which the emigrants to Natal were taken on labour agreements, that any action was taken at all; and their influence was so great in Great Britain as to cause the **British** Go- i vernment  to prevent the proposed legislation in Natal, and insist upon an educational test, so that the susceptibilities of the Indian princes might not be offended.

* That Bill, to which  Mr. Chamberlain  would not advise  Her  Majesty to assent, embodied disqualification based on the place of origin, which is practically a distinction of race and colour, and in this matter  Mr. Chamberlain  returned to his old argument that we must not legislate against colour, but against character.In hisdespatch he said - 
Any attempt to impose disqualifications on the base of such distinctions, besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of **British** rule throughout the Empire.

* When we come to a consideration of the question as it arose in Canada, we find that the **British** Government declined to assent to a measure similar to that which we now have before us.

* According to a recent press telegram it appears that Great Britain, at the instance of Japan, has persuaded the Canadian Government to disallow a Bill lately passed by the Legislature of **British** Columbia, imposing an educational test for the purpose of excluding Chinese and Japanese immigrants, and forbidding their employment in certain kinds of work.

* The Chinese Restriction Bill of **British** Columbia in 1884 was enacted for the purpose of excluding Chinese, and that province of **British** North America has been most persistent inthis matter.

* There is as much credit due to the people of **British** Columbia as to the people of Victoriafor their efforts in this direction.

* From the very earliest period the people of **British** Columbia have legislated against the influx of Chinese into their province, and in 1885 they passed a second Bill even more stringent than that of 1884, in order to prevent an influx of Japanese into their midst.

* We find that the **British** Government treated the Japanese as they did the Chinese on a former occasion, but the same respect is not shown to China to-day, simply because she has no ships of war, though the intelligence of the higher grades of the Chinese is quite as high as that of the people of Japan, and should be respected accordingly.

* I would direct the attention of honorable members to the remarks of the AttorneyGeneral, who said - 
To lump all these peoples together as Asiatics and undesirables would naturally be offensive to a high-spirited people like the Japanese, and surely, without any request from the **British** Government or without any representations from the Japanese people, mere considerations of courtesy, such as should exist between one civilized people and another, should lead us to make this distinction.

* The Secretary of State for the Colonies would appear to have won over the Attorney-General to his way of thinking, and the latter is of opinion that the **British** Government and the **British** connexion must be supported to the extent of casting aside the aspirations of the Australian people, and admitting coloured aliens to our midst, On the ground that to do otherwise would interfere with the **British** Government in certain negotiations they are conducting at the present time.

* Whilst  Mr. Chamberlain  and the Government of this Commonwealth urge that the adoption of such a proposal as that of the honorable member for Bland would embarrass the **British** Government, we have every reason to believe that they would not be embarrassed in the slightest degree.

* Notwithstanding this fact, we find that in **British** Columbia, which is one of the provinces of Canada, the Imperial Government, at the simplest hint from Japan that she was displeased at similar legislation, recently used their influence at Ottawa to prevent such legislation from coming into operation.

* The Emperor of China - as in the case of **British** Columbia - sent a Commission to Australia.

* He said - 
Furthermore, the law in **British** Columbia has proved ineffective, and so far as Natal is concerned, the authorities there were not permitted to enact the law they desired to have brought into operation.

* I would refer the Minister for Defence to the law that, was enacted in **British** Columbia, in 1884, which was passed to exclude the Chinese ; it was found insufficient for the purpose, and an amending Act of a more rigorous character was passed.

* If we desire to know the experience of **British** colonies upon the Chinese question, we have only to refer to the little province of **British** Columbia, and to the colony of Natal, in order to find that in both those places the law has proved ineffectual.

* The **British** Medical Association is not a union, and therefore its members are not unionists; but they belong to an association which exercises closer control over the affairs of the profession than do the trades unions over the affairs of the industries in which they are engaged.

* Moreover, although we have given up about .100,000 a year by reducing the charges on inland and Inter-State telegrams - 72,000 per annum immediate loss; reducing the fees for private bags and private boxes - 2,500 per annum immediate loss ; reducing the charges on Inter-State money orders - 1,800 per annum immediate loss; reducing the postage on letters to the United Kingdom and **British** Possessions from 2 1/2d.

* Like many people engaged in commerce, I, as a primary producer, recognise that without the **British** market, which regulates Australian prices, according to the inevitable law of supply and demand, we should be in a very poor position.

* We must have the protection of the **British** Navy to insure, not only our profits, but even our industrial progress.

* Of course the **British** Parliament has plenary power to enact a Statute creating any privileges that it may think it ought to possess.

* That is the reason why I mentioned the circumstance of the conflict which took place between the Courts and the **British** House of Commons.

* I refer to the deportation by the **British** Government of some 8,000 or 1,0,000 French, from Nova Scotia, to the United States and elsewhere, in 1815.

* There is a paragraph in the report of the **British** Commission which shows that even members of the **British** Government attach great importance to evidence given before such a body.

* If the Government think the emergency is great enough to warrant them in applying an alien system which has never grown up wherever the **British** race has lived, if they think the emergency is so great as to justify them in laying the hand of the law upon these young men.

* With regard to the distinction sought to be made between Australian silver and the **British** currency, there may be some difference of opinion as to whether we should make such a complete distinction as is proposed by the design of the Treasurer.

* When the **British** Government grant to Australia, or any other Dependency, the right to issue silver coins, they must be careful to see that they alone are responsible for their own coinage and loss in weight, and that they do not become responsible for another coinage and loss in weight.

* If a **British** manufacturer of tweeds wishes to register a design in Australia to protect himself from the imitation of his goods by local manufacturers, can he do so without manufacturing here ?

* I think that we ought to extend to **British** manufacturers the right to maintain their copyright of designs here, and that Australian designers should enjoy similar rights in Great Britain.

* Is the request made, and agreed to by the Government, with a view to carrying out the pledges to the **British** people to give a substantial preference to **British** products?'

* Therefore, the door, will be wide open, so far as **British** subjects are concerned.

* Although we apparently all agree that it is of great importance to the Commonwealth that the Nev Hebrides should not pass under any alien control, the action we are taking, as members of the Commonwealth Parliament, is not calculated to further **British** interests there, but rather to alienate them, and indirectly strengthen French interests.

* **British** residents in the New Hebrides by the Commonwealth Government, and the Home Government, and the treatment accorded to French residents by the French Government.

* We must bear in mind that, at the time the New South Wales Government encouraged the scheme of Burns, Philp, and Company for settling **British** and Australian farmers in the New Hebrides, there was an open market in New South Wales, and those settlers went there thinking that that market would continue to be available.

* It will be seen that in every way the French settler has the whip hand of the **British** settler, and the position has become so acute that, in some instances at any rate, the **British** settler has been compelled to sell his produce to his French neighbour.

* This, your Commissioners would point out, is in direct opposition to the policy adopted towards officers employed in tropical countries in, we believe, any other part of the world; it certainly is so as regards **British** Possessions.

* The Papua (**British** New Guinea)  Act vests in the Council of that Territory extensive powers which they can exercise by means of regula-.

* It has again and again reported in favour of the compulsory alienation of the native lands of the Territory, notwithstanding that when the **British** flag was hoisted there  Sir William  McGregor most emphatically informed the natives that their lands should be respected.

* I hope, however, that we shall never see in this or any other **British** community men raised to the Bench because of their political opinions.

* Last session the honorable member for Hindmarsh impugned the impartiality of **British** Judges, and in the course of a speech, on the Australian Industries Preservation Bill said -  
If we had a Labour majority in the **British** Parliament to-day, **British** Judges would administer and interpret many of the laws very differently to what they now 'do.

* As .to naval defence, I should have been very glad to hear the Prime Minister make some statement to the "House as to the intentions of the Government regarding the subsidy we are now paying to the **British** Govern.ment for the presence in our waters of the **British**-Australian Squadron.

* I do not believe that the **British** people look to us for a contribution on that basis, but I think without any hardship to ourselves we might easily increase the existing subsidy from 200,000 to ,500,000 per annum.

* It would, at any rate, "be a more respectable contribution towards the upkeep of the Squadron, which is stationed in these waters chiefly as a protection to our commerce, and which affords that protection not because of its numerical strength, but because it is recognised as part and parcel of the great **British** Navy.

* I believe that it would be useless to spend money in the way proposed by the Government, and that the money would be better spent by subsidizing to a larger extent than we now do the **British** Navy, to secure the protection of the **British** Fleet.

* Anything we might do ourselves in this direction would be but supplementary to what is done by the **British** Government.

* In time of  Avar,  in roy opinion, any vessels at our disposal, of whatever kind they might be, should be placed absolutely at the disposal of the **British** Admiral on the Australian station.

* They think that we should be independent of **British** protection, and that it is time  Ave  struck out for ourselves.

* It would be an ever-increasing drain upon the people in the form of taxation should the country be continually experimenting in  new  types of war vessels, when  Ave  might avail ourselves of the expenditure of the **British** Government, and of the experience of the highest naval authorities in the  world  in matters of naval construction.

* They assiduously fan this proposal for an Australian Navy, not because they wish to co-operate with the Mother Country in the defence of Australia and the **British** Empire, but because they secretly hope, in time to come, to see the proposed Australian Navy used as an effective  weapon  of offence against the **British** Empire, and in defence of an Australian republic.

* So far as I am concerned, the **British** Navy and Empire is good enough for me, and I am no less  a  loyal Australian than any of my friends  who  desire to see the establishment  of an Australian Navy, because 1 am also loyal to the **British** Empire and the **British** Crown.

* I hope that the day is far distant when we shall no longer see **British** warships in the various harbors around Australia.

* It is particularly important, not only that we should maintain the present strength of the **British** Fleet in the Pacific, but that we should augment it, so that our great commerce may be protected.

* Instead of attempting to promote settlement in those islands, and to foster their effective **British** occupation, we have, by our legislation, deliberately imposed barriers to that settlement - barriers which must recoil upon us in time of trouble.

* That is the definition of a leading politician on the social reform side in the **British** House of Commons.

* Talk as we may of the love of the seas being inherent in the **British** race, or of the glorious deeds of the "hearts of oak," we can come to no other conclusion than that which I have indicated with regard to the mental attitude of the Prime Minister.

* But even should it be at any time advisable for Australia, while forming part of the **British** Empire, to take such a step, the occasion for it is not yet ripe.

* If we have a navy, it must, in time of war, be under the control of the **British** authorities.

* To that the Admiralty has replied, " We do not ask for a change in the existing arrangement ; but, even if you cease to subscribe towards the cost of maintaining the **British** Navy, we shall recognise our responsibility to safeguard and protect Australia in common with every other part of the Empire."

* It has taken the attitude that it will not object to the discontinuance of the subsidy, and the substitution of some other arrangement for the present agreement ; but it will not ask for or suggest a change, and insists that even if the Commonwealth Government decide to terminate the existing Agreement, and -build an Australian, fleet of her own, vessels of war must, in time of trouble, be under **British** control.

* I regard the future of Australia, except as part of the **British** Empire, as absolutely and utterly hopeless.

* And such a small flotilla could be used, if at all, merely as an adjunct to the **British** Fleet.

* The **British** Admiralty also made certain suggestions, not of their own volition, but in response to an invitation from the Prime Minister that they should propound a scheme of Australian coastal and harbor defence, with an estimate of its cost.

* Personally, I have' no objection to Australia providing some such means of defence, so long as it really will mean defence, and be serviceable, and also be an adjunct to the **British** Navy, should the necessity ever arise for calling the services of so small a flotilla into requisition.

* The Admiralty are right to insist that in case of war those vessels shall automatically pass under the control of the **British** Admiral.

* A defeat of the **British** Fleet in the Mediterrannean or Channel would mean far more to Australia than even the bombardment of Sydney or Melbourne.

* Her safety depends 011 the **British** Navy, and will continue to so depend.

* It was commonly believed that the ships would be well employed in the defence of particular localities, but this was opposed to all well understood naval stategy, and completely refuted by every page of **British** naval history.

* There is only one position in war time for the **British** man-o'-war to occupy, and that is, in close proximity to the enemy's ships.

* Yes; "but they  did  not attempt  it Avith a  population of four and  a  quarter millions  of  people, nor had: they a **British** Navy behind them.

* I need not refer to the **British** Fleet on the China station or to the Dutch Fleet at Java, which is only a small one.

* The object of the **British** Navy has been to preserve the peace of the world and to safeguard the commerce of the Empire, to keep open the ocean highways of trade, and for that purpose alone does it aim at retaining supremacy of the seas.

* We can best afford that assistance, not by wasting money on small flotillas and experimental fleets, or on a large standing army - by whatever name it might be called - but by increasing our contribution to the cost of the **British** Navy.

* If so, will he invite the **British** Government to have special naval representation on the occasion of the visit, so that the ceremonies may partake of something in the nature of a **British**-American naval demonstration in Australian waters?

* The position of the seamen employed on **British** and foreign ships has no possible connexion with our internal government.

* If the shipping trade of Australia were in a state of crisis, there might be some excuse for obtruding these provisions 
It is to some extent, but having regard to the views that I hold I think that I am justified in asking the Prime Minister whether the delegation to London is to  be  authorized to go so far as to pledge the Commonwealth to the gift of a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Government?

* Leading members of the Ministry have expressed the view that a  Dreadnought  should be given by the Commonwealth to the **British** Government, and I hold that Parliament should have an opportunity to discuss that proposal before the delegation leaves Australia.

* The Government propose that we shall adjourn for three weeks, notwithstanding that the Minister of Defence is likely to leave for London before then, and that we have not yet had from a responsible member of the new Administration a statement as to whether or not they propose that the Commonwealth should) present a  Dreadnought  to the **British** Government or grant an increased naval subsidy.

* That, in the opinion of this House, in view of the facts that the Japanese people have placed themselves in the front rank of civilized nations; that they have proved themselves to be one of the most progressive peoples in the world;that, as a nation, they have become the honoured and trusted friend and ally of the **British** people, and therefore of the **British** Empire ; because of their high national character; and because they have become one of the greatest naval and military powers of the world : the time has arrived for differentiating the Japanese people from other Asiatic races with whom they have been impliedly grouped under the Immigration Restriction Act of1901, and for placing them, in their relationship to the people of Australia, upon the same footing of international amity as that which is now extended to European peoples.

* In addition to these works, an interesting  brochure  has been written by  Senator Pulsford,  entitled,  The **British** Empire and the Relations of Asia and Australasia.

* As history is counted, the years were but few since **British** guns had thundered at the portals of one Eastern country after another, and demanded that all doors be opened to the Britisher, not only for trade, but for residence.

* In 1901 I reminded the House that Japan is our ally ; and  1  could not then understand why we, who professed to desire the consolidation of the **British** Empire - by which is meant, l" suppose, the wish to make it more compact, by harmonizing one part with another, and the whole with the outside world - could, in face of the fact that England was making Japan her greatest national friend, act so insultingly towards her.

* I then represented to the **British** Government that such a course would be offensive and wrong, particularly as the Japanese nation was making such great advances in civilization and material progress.

* That is certainly a strong argument in favour of national stability, and that .is the attribute to which the **British** nation should look more than to any other.

* While I deny that the achievements of Japan are more wonderful than those of the **British** race, though the latter was struggling upward for near two hundred years, and the former was rushing forward but forty, every student must confess that in the whole range of history, there has never appeared another man, who in farseeing wisdom, in a generous love of justice, in keenness of perception, in enlightened statesmanship, and patriotism, worthy to be compared with this Oriental potentate ; and to my notion, the ablest statesman and diplomats of this age, are those now controlling the destinies of our Eastern ally.

* Japan's trade with **British** India is worth about ,5,000,000 a year, and with Great Britain about the same.

* A cable of the 26th April stated that the Canadian Dominion House of Commons had disallowed **British** Columbia legislation against Japanese immigrants, on the ground that such restrictions were incompatible with British6 Imperial interests.

* In  Senator Pulsford's  book on  The **British** Empire and the Relations of Asia and Australia,  there is an account of the steps which  President  Roosevelt has taken to insure the courteous treatment of Japanese citizens, and only this week it was reported that an American Chamber of Commerce has asked the  President  of the United States of America to recommend .Congress to pass legislation which will promote harmony between the United States and Japan.

* Several annexations have been made in the Pacific since that date, but the **British** Government have repudiated them.

* It was' stated at the time of the Samoan annexation by Germany and America that **British** influence in Tonga should not be disturbed.

* We might have expected that, during the recent negotiations between the **British** and  French  Governments, which led to the establishment of the most friendly relations between t'hose powers, some effort would have been made to promote Australian interests in the New Hebrides.

* Dr. Paton,  who lived in the New Hebrides for many years, and who, perhaps, has done more than any other man for the people of those islands, has stated most emphatically that French interests in those islands are expanding by leaps and bounds, whereas **British**  influence is not being increased to any appreciable extent.

* This is largely due to the fact t'hat the French residents enjoy very much more freedom of trade than do the **British** settlers.

* The resolution points to ' the importance of endeavouring to arrive at a more satisfactory agreement with regard to the control of the islands, and I hope that representations will be made to the **British** Government, through the Department of External Affairs, with this end in view.

* The strategical situation, moreover, of Western Australia, dominating, as it does, the southern side of the Indian Ocean, and the converging trade routes from the West, must be considered as of the greatest importance to **British** and Australian interests.

* In addition to that, the right honorable member for Swan has placed a memorandum on the papers embodying an extract from a report from Major-General Edwards, then commanding the **British** troops in Hong Kong.

* Major-General Edwards states - 
I take it that, with regard to all these items, the purpose of preferential trade is to prefer the goods of the **British** manufacturer to those of the foreign manufacturer, whilst at the same time no injury is done to the Australian manufacturer.

* I assume that, in endeavouring to give a preference to **British** manufacturers as against foreign manufacturers, we do not desire to do anything which would handicap the Australian manufacturer.

* The Minister was not quite civil when honorable members took him at his word, and as matters have developed he has brought down the simple proposal that English goods imported in foreign bottoms shall be given a preference as if they were **British** goods.

* I take it that the desire of honorable members is to give a preference to **British** goods, and the accident that some of them have come out in foreign bottoms may very well be overlooked.

* As to the difficulties which have been mentioned, which the Minister saw in the beginning, and which were alluded to by the honorable and learned member for Angas and the honorable member for South Sydney, any one who has done any importing knows that there are attached to bills of lading invoices showing the goods imported, and whether they came out in **British** or foreign bottoms.

* The first set are to be imposed - 
On dutiable goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, and imported "direct in **British** ships.

* If they had not been imported in **British** ships, what then ?

* On dutiable goods not the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, or not imported direct in **British** ships.

* Therefore these duties will not apply to foreign goods imported in **British** ships.

* He makes the ignorant proposal that **British** goods coming out in foreign bottoms are not to be given a preference.

* Are they not still **British** goods?

* On the other hand, foreign goods coming out in **British** bottoms are not to be subject to the higher rates of duty.

* He will not give  0  concession to **British** goods coming out in foreign bottoms.

* Then, again, foreign goods coming out in **British** bottoms are not to be subjected to the higher rates of duty.

* It would appear that, if **British** goods are not imported direct in **British** bottoms, they will not obtain the benefit of the preference.

* It further appears that if foreign good's are imported in **British** bottoms they will receive the preference.

* is intended to give a preference to **British** goods over those of foreign manufacture.

* However, as I understand the Minister has agreed to limit his proposal to **British** goods which are now in transit in **British** bottoms, the amount involved will not be considerable.

* In the present instance, however, the Minister proposes to subject **British** goods which are now upon the water in **British** bottoms, and **British** goods which are in bond, to the old rates of duty.

* Regarding that measure it seems a little extraordinary that whereas on 10th May, 1901 - the day after the opening of Parliament -  Senator O'Connor  made a mistake in saying that the colour line would be applicable to all coloured aliens except **British** subjects, to whom an educational test would .

* What is usual in all **British** communities - to collect the higher duties when an alteration in the Tariff is proposed.

* It was appointed to consider whether, on grounds of public health, it was desirable that certain classes of spirits, **British** and foreign, should be kept in bond for a definite period before they were allowed to pass into consumption, and to inquire into the system of blending **British** and foreign spirits in or out of bond.

* We are next invited to saythat for another reason - the approachof a general election in the mother country - we are incompetent to deal with it, and, thirdly, the right honorable member calls upon us to say that we rely upon the **British** people to deal with the question in an equitable manner.

* By becoming citizens of the Commonwealth,  We  have not ceased to be in some sense, at all events, citizens of the **British** Empire.

* We are shut out - and perhaps some people desire that we should be - from the **British**.

* I should prefer that it should be effected on a grand scale and at once, but from my knowledge of history, particularly of that of the **British** people and of our own countrymen and" their methods here, it is plain that the reform will be brought about only in a fragmentary way, piece by piece, step by step, and stage by stage, as may appear possible.

* Unfortunately, I happen to differ from the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in regard to the final sentence of the second paragraph of his motion, which relates to the **British** Parliament.

* There is only one other authority whom I propose to quote before concluding my remarks - I refer to  Sir Frederick  Pollock, who has been very prominent of late as the spokesman of a group of thinkers representing all parties in England, who foresee the necessary reconstruction of the **British** parliamentary system.

* Sir Frederick  Pollock, speaking on the Federation of the Empire, says - 
That this House confidently relies upon the fairness and wisdom pf the **British** people for the removal of every just Irish grievance in the manner most likely to promote the welfare of the Irish people and the stability of the Empire.

* The **British** people, and, their representatives, the **British** Parliament.

* And so if I were a member of the **British** Parliament:, I would consent to a just measure of Home 
In this respect the natural judges are the people of the **British** Empire.

* On  Wednesday  next it is proposed to hold public meeting support **British** Government policy in South Africa.

* So that this is a meeting to declare adhesion to the **British** Government policy in South Africa, and to bid farewell to the members of the contingent who are going to South Africa, and to whom farewell could not be bidden unless they  were  present.

* There is not one of the States which has not declared in a voice which there can be no mistaking that it is in accord with the **British** Government policy in South Africa.

* To support the **British** policy in South Africa is the policy of Australia, and that fact appears upon official records.

* Although this question may in England be of the dimensions of a political question, because of there being a substantial division of parties there - although there is a majority of three to one in favour of the war - it has ceased to be one here, because both the States and the Commonwealth have decided over and over again in favour of the **British** Government policy.

* If we decide by resolution of both Houses that certain things are as they are, and give indorsement to the **British** policy, surely the question whether we are to go on and finish the war and contribute towards that end in men and money is a question which has been settled without the possibility of reversal.

* But the German reply to this neighbourly treatment by Great Britain is to levy a prohibitive rate against the **British** steamer entering a German island group, and to charge vessels flying the Union Jack more than fifty times as much for the privilege of trading with a German possession as Britain charges a vessel flying the German flag for the privilege of entering a **British**-owned harbor in the South Seas.

* But these transhipped imports must be paid for in **British** goods, so that Great Britain profits by the arrangement.

* placed on record some figures that will be of special interest to preferential traders, who are always talking about the decay of **British** commerce.

* In 1905 our imports from Great Britain were valued at 23,074,717; from **British** possessions, 5,384,150; and from foreign countries, ^9,887,864.

* In 1903 we received from Britain imports valued at 19,855,340 ; from **British** possessions, 4,980,880 ; and from foreign countries, 12,975,251.

* Thus, within three years, there was an increase in our importations from Britain of 3,219,377; and from **British** possessions an increase of 403,270; whilst our imports from foreign countries fell off to the extent of ^3.087,387.

* I desire to have these figures placed on record, because we have heard so much from the Treasurer about the fall-i ing-off of **British** trade.

* In 1905 our exports to Great Britain were valued at 26,089,996; to **British** Possessions, 10,751,886 ; and to foreign countries, -17,619,326.

* As compared with 1903, our exports to Great Britain increased by 6,518,193; and to foreign countries to the extent of 5,408,051.; whereas there was a falling-off in our exports to **British** Possessions to the extent of 3,045,975.

* The difference in the proportion of **British** trade is represented by our exports to foreign countries, and these figures should certainly satisfy our protectionist friends.

* I do not profess to be a very great financier ; but I have taken the position as it has been placed before us bv the honorable member for Mernda, and I have assumed that his figures are correct - although I find that they do not agree with those contained in the Treasurer's Budget-- 
That this House authorizes the Government to accept **British** New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth, if His Majesty's Government are willing to place it under federal control.

* Turning first to the physical aspects of the matter, **British** New Guinea comprises an area of 90,500 square miles.

* The principal waterway is the Fly River, which runs for 620 miles through **British** territory - it does not end in **British** territory - and is navigable by steam launch, at any rate for about 500 miles.

* In that year, with the consent of  Mr. Thomas  McIlwraith, afterwards  Sir Thomas  McIlwraith,  Mr. Chester  set the **British** flag flying in New Guinea.

* An Act called the **British** New Guinea Queensland Act was passed in 1887, and was assented to on 4th November of the same year.

* That was the preamble to the Act, the 1st schedule to which contained the draft proposals for the administration of **British** New Guinea.

* These provided that Queensland was - 
To undertake by a permanent Appropriation Act to defray the cost of the Administration of the government of **British** New Guinea to an extent not exceeding 15,000 per annum for theterm of five years, subject to the following conditions : - 
So that each colony was to be liable for one-third of an expenditure the" total of which was not to exceed 15,000 ; and any contribution made by the Governments of the other Australasian colonies was to be applied in reduction of the amount which the three colonies were called upon to pay under the two articles I have just quoted.

* the financial matter was concerned, but there was another schedule to this Act containing amended proposals for the administration of **British** New Guinea.

* To this it is not, I think, necessary to make a,ny reference, except to mention that the term of five years was altered to ten years, and also to quote the 19th and 20th articles, which are these - 
The Governor of Queensland to be directed to consult his Executive Council upon all matters relating to **British** New Guinea.

* After that Act was passed, there were issued on the 8th June, 1888, pursuant to Orders in Council, letters patent  constituting **British** New Guinea a separate possession.

* He sends with his despatch a copy of the despatch from the Administrator of **British** New Guinea, to which I shall have to refer again ; also a copy ofa letter from  Mr. Philp,  Premier of Queensland; and a despatch from the LieutenantGovernor, forwarding the estimates.

* In the course of his despatch  Sir Samuel  Griffith says :  - 
That is, in view of the insufficiency of the local revenue to provide for the finances of **British** New Guinea - by the three Governments, that the probable deficiency in the funds of the possession at the end of the year ending 30th June, 1901, which was then estimated at 7,000, should be guaranteed by the three colonies in equal shares, in the event of the Government of the Commonwealth not sooner taking over the financial responsibility; and an appropriation ordinance, authorizing an excess expenditure of that amount, was duly sanctioned and passed by the New Guinea Legislature.

* The proposal includes the whole possession of **British** New Guinea.

* That accumulated revenue fund was practically the property of the three States responsible for the administration of **British** New Guinea, and the additional 7,000 was taken out of the revenue fund and added to the 15,000 which was found practically by the three States.

* In whichever way we deal with it, the revenue from **British** New Guinea land must largely increase.

* In my reply to him - and I am bound to state briefly what took place - I said - 
If we take over **British** New Guinea, of course we can make that good.

* I, therefore, asked His Excellency to  send  the following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : - 

 Mr. Barton has been in communication with the Government of Queensland, and also with the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, on the question of the future of **British** New Guinea.

* Referring to your telegram of 15th August, His Majesty's Government quite prepared to approve **British** New Guinea being placed under Commonwealth Government, but much regret impossible to ask Imperial Parliament for Imperial contribution towards expenses of Administration.

* Please obtain from Governor of Queensland my despatch, **British** New Guinea, No.

* With reference to that despatch of the 8th June, 1898, which honorable members will have an opportunity of reading before they come to a decision, the chief reason .given by the Imperial Government for the withdrawal of their contribution was that **British** New Guinea was annexed only in response to the unanimous demand of Australia, and upon the understanding that the Australian colonies would pay for the administration of the new dependency, which was to be, to all intents and purposes, an Australian possession.

* The justification for that paragraph will be found in what I said some time ago, when I mentioned that at the Imperial Conference the contributing colonies agreed to spend the 15,000 a year then mentioned, if, instead of allowing it to remain a protectorate, the **British** Government would make New Guinea a **British** possession, and annex it - 

 Mr. Barton will be glad if Your  Excellency  will suggest, by telegram, to the Secretary of State that the reasons set forth in his despatch for the refusal of a subsidy by  His  Majesty's Government seem to Your Excellency's Ministers, with great respect, not to preclude further consideration.

* These reasons imply that the whole benefit of any present or future trade with the possession will accrue to Australia ; but it is a fact that a large part of the profit must accrue to the **British** manufacturer or exporter, whose goods are the subject of the trade, and whose interest in the possession is none the less real because his business is, in this regard, conducted by an Australian resident.

* Referring to your telegrams of 14th September and 4th October, **British** New Guinea.

* In the face, therefore, of the unwillingness of the **British** Government to contribute, and in the face of the fact, which is true, that while a large proportion of the trade is in goods manufactured in England, nevertheless, as pointed out by subsequent despatches of the Secretary of State, a large proportion of the trade is in foodstuffs that come from Australia, it will not be right for the Commonwealth to neglect its material and trade obligations in this matter.

* Referring to the telegram of 5th October from Governor of Queensland to me,  His  Majesty's Government cannot accept suggestion that **British** New Guinea should be created Crown colony ; they have no objection to your Government having fullest power of control, with regard to possession on accepting responsibility of its administration and expenditure.

* His Majesty's Government most earnestly hope that in the interests of **British** New Guinea, and of Australia itself, with which the possession is so closely connected as a natural dependency, your Government will either take over administration at once, or will come to some temporary understanding with Government of Queensland for carrying on administration pending arrangement of details in order that immediate embarrassment of **British** New Guinea may be relieved.

* If **British** New Guinea were to lapse into the same condition as the German or Dutch parts of New Guinea, then the position of the Commonwealth would be rendered more difficult, and much as we may lament the fact that we cannot have the whole of New Guinea brought under our control, that circumstance should not deter us from seeking to exercise control over that part of the island from which the proximate danger may arise.

* If we wish to secure some return for our money, let us at once get rid of this fanciful notion of non-alienation of the lands of **British** New Guinea.

* We retain **British** New Guinea because of the danger to Australia if the island should fall completely into other hands.

* In the old country the authorities are altogether too strict where the **British** soldier is concerned.

* As soon as the struggle is over, and the **British** have established their supremacy in South Africa, he will see whether it is or is not a political question.

* The advertisement merely states that the following resolutions will be submitted : - 
That in the opinion of this 'meeting the policy of the **British** Government in their conduct of the war in South Africa meets with the approval of all loyal South Australians.

* The Minister of Trade and Customs this morning indulged in some high-flown sentiments about the glorious ideal of **British** preference, and one would' have thought, from his utterances, that the motion embodied a substantial trade concession to Great Britain, offered as an evidence of our desire to preserve the unity of the Empire, and to cement the bonds of kinship about which the Government have recently said so much.

* This is a travesty upon the principle of preferential trade, and is a downright insult to the **British** nation.

* The balance of the items will confer no advantage on the old country since they relate to specialties which do not come into serious competition with **British** imports, while some of them &lt;lo not compete at all.

* The Minister suggested that the **British** nation should give a preference to Australia on foodstuffs, but the only way in which that could be done would be by imposing duties upon foodstuffs sent from other countries, which would increase the cost of food  in  Great Britain.

* That is recognised b" the **British** people, and I draw attention to the unanimity of the labour organizations of that country on the point, when  Mr. Chamberlain  brought forward his proposal for preferential trade.

* The **British** people have emphatically asserted that they are opposed to duties on foodstuffs.

* That was abundantly manifested by the result of the last **British** elections, and is further proved by the following .resolution, passed by the House of Commons, on the motion of  Sir James  Kitson, on the 13th March last: - 
That resolution was carried by 474 votes to 98, a majority of 376 being in favour of it.

* Therefore, the Minister cannot reasonably expect that the present **British** Parliament will place duties .on foodstuffs.

* Of these goods, r.,473&gt;l89 worth come from the United Kingdom; 20,531 from Canada; 6,274 from India; and 838 from other **British** possessions.

* Against this total importation of 1,500.832 from Great Britain and **British** possessions, there are importations from Japan and China, valued at 28,765; from the United States of America, valued at ,432&gt;533j and from other foreign countries, valued at 329,306, a total of 79&gt;6o3- If will thus be seen that the greater part of the trade upon which preference is proposed to be given is already in **British** hands.

* Britain and foreign countries in relation to goods upon which, even under the present scheme, a real preference might have been given to Great Britain : - Horseshoe nails, **British**, 3,154; foreign, 8,1.70; nails, wire staples, &amp;c, **British**, 16,455; foreign, 44.359 ; wire, iron and steel, **British**, 31,077; foreign, 296,387; wire netting, **British**, 220,083  &gt;  foreign, .115,1.1:4; barbed wire, **British**, 11,139; foreign', , 60,267; n.e.i., wire, **British**, 27,304; foreign.

* The total of these imports is, **British** ^09,212, and foreign 554.389.

* On the contrary, a number of articles have been selected which are already free, and it is proposed to levy a duty upon those articles when they are of other than **British** origin.

* Of the remainder of the articles .specified in the schedule, a number are of a special character which do not enter into competition with **British** manufactures.

* If time permitted I could show that the proposal will inflict injury upon **British** trade to the extent of 130.000 or 150,000 a year.

* I shall certainly vote for the amendment submitted bv the honorable member for Parramatta, and should it be defeated I -will move - 
That all the words after " that " be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words " This House affirms the desirability of establishing a system of preferential trade with Great Britain, upon the basis of conceding a Tariff reduction upon all dutiable imports of **British** manufacture coming into the Common-  wealth of Australia."

* The kanaka is brought into a highly civilized **British** country in order that he may help to bear the white man's burden.

* Daughters of civilization, offspring of **British** fathers and mothers, the sweet school girl of the years that have gone, afterwards, may be, the beloved of some honest **British** man's heart, yields to the embrace of a filthy savage.

* All this in a Christian State under the **British** flag.

* These Parsees are **British** subjects, but they belong to a subject race, and I hope they always will do.

* I have spoken in this Parliament, and in the State Parliament of Victoria on several occasions, against the great injury that is being done to **British** naval supremacy by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.

* That company has done more to weaken the **British** mercantile marine than has any other company whose vessels leave **British** ports.

* The **British** Board of Trade, I believe, has fined the company repeatedly by not permitting it to utilize as much cargo room as the tonnage of its vessels would allow.

* I do not feel under the slightest bond of regard to it, but I do feel a great amount of respect for the Orient Steam Navigation Company, because it has worked its ships with white labour, and by so doing, has tended to promote, instead of lowering the **British** naval supremacy.

* Company receives more money from the **British** Government by way of subsidy than the Nordeutscher Lloyd Company or the Hamburg-American line receives from the German Government.

* It shows its gratitude by carrying German goods for 50 per cent, less than it charges for the carriage of **British** .goods.

* Mr. John  Dillon, M.P., said that - 
A **British** sailor should not be subjected to the competition of men who would work for half his wages and live on half his food.

* On the same occasion  Mr. Havelock  Wilson said that he -  di.i not object to lascars being employed, but they should be so on the same terms with regard  to  wages, accommodation, and food as **British** seamen.

* Mr. Lloyd George, who is a member of the present Ministry in England -  noticed that while on the American lines, and the Castle and Union lines, go per cent, of the seamen were **British**, on tramps 30 per cent.,,on the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's vessels only 25 per cent, wereBritish.

* If there were not there ought to be, as when the **British** flag flew over South Africa, he supposed that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company would have at.

* He said that we could not expect lascars to fight England's battles at sea, and that, if theBritish mercantile marine were not manned7 by **British** sailors, Great Britain would beplaced in a position of great danger, because landsmen could not serve in time of" need, since they would not have the necessary training.

* The Government had called attention to thefact that the space supplied to Iascar  seamen  was not the space provided for **British** seamen, and that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company were not acting in accordance with the Merchant Shipping Act.

* We should not then have the Peninsular and Oriental Company charging the foreigner - though I must say I respect Germany as a great nation - 50 per cent, less than is charged to people of the **British** race, although the latter are responsible for the large subsidies it receives.

* All Australian Navy advocates admit the essentiality of the control of the seas in time of war ; and they admit that that control can only be effective by an Imperial,  or, as they wish it, a **British**, fleet acting off the coast-line of the enemy.

* It would be just as idle to treat nhat expression of opinion on the part of the **British** officer as a serious one as it would be absurd for a woman to boast, on returning from a visit to a chatty friend, that she had been told, in answer to an inquiry, that she was " looking perfectly lovely, my dear" - or something to that effect.

* When that vessel was in port at, I think, Hong Kong, the captain of one of the **British** ships there accepted an invitation to dine with Captain Creswell.

* Great and powerful as the **British** Fleet is, it will be taxed to the uttermost to cover and protect a world-wide commerce, which is the life of the nation - 
I have already shown that the Empire is making adequate preparations to protect that commerce on the seas - and at the same time to carry on the heavy work of the major operations of war in Europe.

* Absolute and complete dependence by Australia upon the **British** Navy, situated as we are at the extremity of the Empire, will add to that strain.

* Immediately after the unfortunate outrage on the Dogger Bank, at which time the  Challenger  happened to be at Port Melbourne, instructions were wired to the **British** Fleets, wherever stationed, as a matter of ordinary course, to be in readiness for all eventualities.

* But whatever the explanation may be, she stood on, and if it had not been for the common sense of the **British** commander, she might have been blown out of the water.

* There is not the slightest doubt that **British** ships would be able to hunt down every one of the enemy's vessels which might get through the blockade.

* Some persons seem to think that this ,200,000  n  year we give the **British** Navy is a magnificent display of Australian generosity.

* I say, we are bound to look more squarely in the face our responsibilities to the **British** Empire.

* And not only responsibility to the **British** Empire; but responsibility to the people intrusted to our charge !

* That shows the necessity of contributing to the **British** Navy, and of consolidating and strengthening the Empire by every means in our power.

* The schedule to the Customs Tariff (**British** Preference) 1906 is amended by omitting in the column headed "Duties" all the words in the first and second sub-headings after the words "United Kingdom."

* A largely attended meeting of the members of the Tobacco Workers Union was held in the Trades Hall to-night, and made an emphatic protest against the factory of the **British** Australasian Tobacco Company being closed down at a minute's notice.

* This letter was dated 19th September, and was published as coming from " The **British** Australasian ' Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited."

* I mightcall attention to the fact that in the Mother Country, within 'the last few years, there has been quite a succession of Select Com-   mittees  appointed to inquire into the administration of the **British** Post Office.

* My knowledge of **British** politics is not ample enough to enable me to say.

* I found, to my surprise, on looking through  Todd,  that a **British** Gorvernment has appointed Royal Commissions on a resolution of the House, against which the Government voted, and on which they were defeated -  Todd,  Vol.

* But we might consider the question whether we ought not- to put at the disposal of the Post Office, such  a sum as the **British** Post Office has found necessary for its operations, conducted in that country by means of a system of terminable annuities.

* Mounted Rifles, who fought to save South Africa for the **British** rule in the recent war, in the London  Daily Chronicle  of the 19th October - 
I claim for those 7,000 citizens the same protection as the 1,400 enjoy.

* If that raw material is sent from the Continent to England and manufactured into garments, those garments come out here under the preferential **British** rate, so that the makers of similar garments here have really only 5 per cent.

* Those who objected in the old days to factory legislation, declared that it would lead to the decline of **British** manufactures.

* passengers carried by oversea **British** and foreign ships coastwise in the Commonwealth during 1903, distinguishing the numbers carried by **British** or by foreign ships as far as is possible ?

* I think two petitions, if not more, have been presented in favour of trial byjury, and, although there is every confidence in Judge Murray, there is that feeling which animates every **British** community in favour of the ancient form of trial.

* I have no fault to find with the opinions of any honorable member^ I state my own openly, and I think it is remarkable that any loyal man in the **British** Empire should choose what is admittedly a great democratic occasion to create difficulties between the Commonwealth and the Imperial Government, when for the first time we have to approach them in regard to any great question.

* I do not think there is any honorable member who is not aware that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland will not be acceptable to the **British** Government, because it will produce international complications.

* Surely the objection is not a whim % These **British** statesmen are engaged in the great and important work of governing the greatest nation in the world.

* I am quite confident that any honorable member desiring to choose the easier path would speak on the other side; but every one of us has serious and final responsibilities to the whole **British** people.

* It is the **British** Army and the **British** Navy that we depend upon, and it is the **British** Array and Navy and **British** statesmen we flout with an amendment such as that which has been proposed.

* The question is whether, without injustice, or without making the work of the **British** statesmen more difficult, it is possible to bring about the result we desire.

* The time may come - perhaps it is not far off - when this law, being of a temporary kind, but having answered its purpose - having enabled us to gain our end without injustice to **British** statesmen - will go into the waste-paper basket.

* When the Defence Bill was being debated, the first line of defence that was continually alluded to was the **British** navy.

* The **British** Government suggest a certain method of obtaining what we require, and are we to say - " We shall not adopt that method.

* We cannot, in the piping times of peace, flout those who govern the great mother country, and jeer at the **British** flag, and then, in time of war, crawl under that flag for protection.

* Whatever friction there may be between ourselves and the mother country, we should not permit ourselves to forget that with the assistance of the **British** Empire a white Australia is possible for ever, while without the mother country behind us the future has nothing but the blackness of despair.

* It is not to the Chinese themselves that we owe the existence of the opium traffic, but to the **British** authorities who in earlier years insisted upon the drug being imported into China against the repeated protests of the Chinese authorities, because the Indian Government found that through the cultivation of the poppy in that country and the exportation of opium to China, manufactured from the poppy, they were able not only to secure very large returns in the form of revenue, but also to enable the cultivators to reap very large profits.

* By means of the dissemination of literature, however, chiefly through the agency of the Christian Union for the Severance of the Connexion of the **British** Empire with the Opium Traffic, the **British** people have been largely made aware of their full responsibility, and have displayed willingness to do what they can to remedy the evils which have arisen chiefly through the mistaken policy of their rulers in the past.

* In the beginning the **British** authorities forced this trade upon China, despite the repeated protests of the rulers of that country, and it may be interesting in this connexion to read something that has been said by the Chinese Imperial Commissioner, who issued a proclamation upon the subject some time before the first opium war.

* The proclamation, which was addressed to the foreign merchants in China, contains the following pertinent question and comment : - 
It will be observed from this that, notwithstanding the determination, of the **British** authorities to insist upon the drug being imported into China, the rulers of that country, realizing the evil effects of opium-smoking, did what they could to discourage the- practice, and imposed penalties upon those who were found indulging in it.

* The action of the **British** authorities in forcing the opium traffic on the Chinese led to a series of wars - three in all - upon which I do not care to dwell, because that aspect of the question is exceedingly painful for any one of **British** origin to contemplate.

* But throughout all the negotiations with China a continuous protest was made by that country against its introduction, and it was only the force of **British** arms which ultimately compelled its acceptance.

* The **British** flag is hoisted to protect an infamous contraband traffic ; and if it was never hoisted, except as it is now hoisted on the coast of China, we should recoil from its sight with horror.

* That the continuance of the trade in opium, and the monopoly of its growth in the territory of **British** India, are destructive of all relations of amity between England and China, injurious to the manufacturing interests of the country by the very serious diminution of legitimate commerce, and utterly inconsistent with the honours and duties of a Christian kingdom, and that steps be taken as soon as possible, with due regard to rights of Governments and individuals, to abolish the evil.

* I notice that a great agitation has been going on amongst the **British** people in- opposition to the opium trade, and, on 9th December last, an overflowing meeting was held in Exeter Hall, London, calling upon Christians, under a deep sense of duty, to unite in a determined effort to bring our national connexion with the opium traffic to an end.

* It is felt that the opium traffic is a stain on the fair fame of the **British** people, and that owing to her power in the matter, it is England's duly to mankind to efface the stain, 5?

* The House may perhaps be interested to hear briefly a few opinions on the subject by some of those who have been interested in the **British** Administration in China.

* Sir Rutherford  Alcock, **British** Ambassador, in his despatch on the subject in 1869, said - 
I think it desirable to place the House in possession of the opinions entertained on this question bymany former **British** representatives in China - opinions formed by them after many years' residence, during which they gained a full knowledge of the evil effects attending the opium habit.

* The vision of a written Constitution for the **British** Empire, analagous to those of the United States, the Dominion of Canada, and the Commonwealth, which would embrace, not  only  self-governing communities, but Federated Unions of States as its members, is at first sight alluring by its magnificence.

* It would compel the representatives of the Colonies to' remain silent upon about 99 per cent, of the questions which engage the attention of the **British** Parliament, or to meddle in matters in regard to which they should abstain from interference.

* To come a little closer to the question of preferential trade itself, I cannot see how, with any sense of selfrespect, we could pass a resolution asking the **British** people for further concessions in respect of whatever we may do in this direction.

* There is, in addition,  a  considerable trade of the **British** Empire which  never  touches the shores of the United Kingdom.

* The fleet which protects that trade is supported by taxation upon the slender earnings of the **British** working classes, which it is now proposed to tax to  a  still greater extent, in return for so-called concessions to be grantedby us.

* If such be the basis of our loyalty, if with some of the Celtic strain in it the tone of **British** patriotism has sunk in these States so low, all I can say is that we had better import some of those eastern races whom, by ourlegislation, we profess todespise  to  inoculate  our stock with a little of that temper that teaches men to live and die for an ideal.

* The  Toronto Globe  resents, as I shall ask the House to do by passing the amendment which I have foreshadowed, the imputation upon their loyalty and self-respect in the following word  s: - 
Every self-respecting Canadian resents the argument used on scores of platforms in Britain, and published in scores of **British** newspapers, that  Mr. Chamberlain's  protectionist policy, even though it may raise the cost of food to millions of wage-earners in Britain, should be adopted by the **British** people, because it would secure and retain the loyalty of the Colonies.

* Speaking especially in the French Colony of Quebec, he declared that Canada is [loyal, happy, and satisfied to live under the **British** flag, but if we wished to tighten the tie we should break it.

* The adopted candidate, in the course of a lengthy address on Canadian politics, referred to the suggested scheme of  Mr. Chamberlain,  and none of his remarks were more enthusiastically applauded than those in which, with considerable indignation, he repudiated the suggestion that farming in Canada required any artificial advantages in the **British** market.

* At one time American fish and lumber were excluded from the **British** West Indies to give Canadians a monopoly of the trade.

* An examination of **British** imports and colonial exports shows that it is impossible to have a preference upon a few special articles, inasmuch as none which are at once of general export from all Possessions and foreign countries can be found.

* Such action will probably be misinterpreted in England, whereas an increase in the regular duties would still maintain the principle of uniform preference for **British** goods.

* I do not propose to examine in detail the conditions of English trade, though, as I have said, only one-fourth of the external trade of that country is with **British**' possessions.

* Therefore, there is not much from the **British** point of view in the system of preferences.

* About 28 per cent, of the imports of raw material, food, and drink - nonalcoholicof the United Kingdom comes from **British** possessions, so that over 70 per cent, comes from outside the Empire.

* ^82,000,000 of that trade was done with **British** possessions, so that in respect of our trade the Empire cannot be in a bad way, as I think the honorable member for New England will show, when he speaks, by most carefully compiled statistics.

* Mr. Chamberlain  originally asked, as part of 'his policy, that we should not start any new industries which might interfere with **British** exports.

* knows the reason why some 
**British** imports have not kept up the old proportionate rate of increase.

* Nevertheless,  Mr. Chamberlain  recently asked that we should stop initiating any new industries which might compete with **British** exports to us.

* As it is pointed out by  Mr. Spender  in the article in the  Fortnightly Review  from which I have quoted, we were told years ago by  Mr. W.  R. Greg, in an article entitled the " Warnings of Cassandra," that twothirds of **British** industry and population must disappear, and that the vast proportion of **British** imports then paid for by millions of exports would have to be foregone or purchased by other fund's.

* I brought it under the attention of the Prime Minister some time ago, in order that the necessary steps might be taken for the introduction of a Bill for the Act required to give the guarantee necessary before the **British** Government will put stock upon the trustees' list.

* I recognise that fact, but I would point out that, under the Bill, **British** goods shipped in foreign bottoms, are to pay the higher duties, whilst a preference is to be given to **British** goods imported in **British** bottoms.

* Does the Minister propose to give the same concession to **British** goods in foreign ships now on the high seas as he gives to **British** goods in foreign bottoms now on the high seas?

* There is a. justification for differentiating between **British** goods shipped in **British** bottoms and those shipped in foreign bottoms now on the high seas, and I do not think that any injustice will be done.

* **British** goods shipped in **British** bottoms, and now on the high seas, will be admitted as before.

* Does the Minister propose to relieve **British** goods now on the high seas in foreign bottoms from the obligation of paying the higher rates of duty ?

* From the racial point of view, to say nothing of the medical point of view and the view of protecting the worker from the competition of the black man, we, as the sons of **British** people, born in Australia, want to see the White Australia policy maintained, and always have done.

* I have never been able to reconcile myself to the opinion that with a **British** system of government and with our **British** ideas elective Ministries are possible.

* I decided to run for the Katau River, **British** New Guinea, where twenty years ago I beached the schooner  Herald.

* Thus, through no fault of his own, he is denied what ought to be the right of every **British** subject.

* I venture to say, the Parliament of a **British** community - is asked to deliberately surrender .its right of controlling the Tariff and of regulating industrial concerns.

* **British** authorities with those who were engaged in the war.

* I would point out that this question became one, not between the **British** authorities in South Africa and  Major Lenehan,  but between the military authorities here and  Major Lenehan,  inasmuch as that officer, on his return to Australia was refused reinstatement on account of alleged- events in South Africa.

* It meant that that officer, who had gone forth with a good character, who had entered the Forces in South Africa, who had done remarkably good work there, who 'had so satisfied the **British** officers over him, that when his contingent had returned to Australia, they requested him to remain and command another corps which was being raised, was not what his service showed him to be, but was an individual who had so disgraced himself by his association with ' certain massacres, that he ought not to be replaced in his position in Australia.

* The Prime Minister has informed us of the results of inquiries which were made from the **British** Government.

* That officer, however, declares that he reported all to his  Colonel, who  was a **British** officer, but who unfortunately was absent from South Africa at the time the court martial was held.

* If there is anything against  Major Lenehan  bevond what was disclosed at that inquiry, the **British** authorities should produce it, and they have been asked to do so.

* The **British** Government declare that they have nothing against   Major Lenehan  beyond what was disclosed before the court martial.

* The **British** Government say that they have not got it.

* Then the Australian military authorities refused to do what has been done in the case- of many **British** officers who have been reprimanded - to replace him in the local forces.

* In this case that verdict simplv amounted to a reprimand, and the **British** Government assert that they have nothing against  Major Lenehan  beyond what was adduced before that tribunal.

* The right honorable member can make no reply to the statement that the **British** authorities  have nothing against  Major Lenehan  except that for which he was tried by court martial.

* The late Government inquired whether there was anything against  Major Lenehan,  except that for which he had been dealt with by court martial, and, after taking time to make an investigation, the **British** authorities replied that there was nothing.

* He was reprimanded by the court martial : but that is a frequent occurrence in the **British** Army.

* Many **British** officers have been reprimanded, and have immediately returned to their regiments.

* If he has been guilty of such actions he certainly ought not to be reinstated, but the **British** Government in its reply to the inquiry made by the Commonwealth Government, acquit him of everything save that for which he was dealt with by ihe court martial.

* I am opposed to entering into the question as between  Major Lenehan  and the **British** authorities.

* I advised him that it was better that he should accept reinstatement - if it were offered to him - rather than insist upon an inquiry which would lead only to the re-opening of old South African troubles, which should be heard of no more, and possibly create friction between the **British** Government and the Commonwealth authorities.

* That is the whole position, and I feel satisfied that when honorable members have inquired into the matter, as the Prime Minister and I have done, they will arrive at the conclusion that this officer would have been subjected to a most serious injustice had his reinstatement been refused, when it was acknowledged by the **British** Government that there was no reason, and that a serious stain would have been placed' on his character by the military authorities in his own country - such a stain as would attach not only to the man himself, but to his descendants, because these events become historic.

* I have every sympathy with those who desire to to see **British** ships manned by **British** seamen, and no one regrets, more than I do the fact that such a large proportion of foreign seamen are employed in the **British** mercantile marine.

* A great many of these are **British** subjects, and we should be verv careful before we attempt to exclude them from employment in **British** ships.

* I would welcome any opportunity to add to the proportion of **British** sailors, but, unfortunately, the proposal of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie appears to be impracticable.

* I was a mariner in my younger days, and I know that **British** shipmasters experience great difficulty in procuring **British** seamen.

* At most **British** ports, for every Britisher who presents himself for engagement, two dozen foreigners offer their services.

* For various reasons, the **British** sailor, as a species, seems to be dying out, There are many ways, to account for this scarcity of **British** seamen, not the least significant being 'the fact that no calling is less attractive than that of a sailor on a merchant ship.

* **British** manufacturers, or exporters, could not insist upon the shipowners employing only **British** seamen.

* Is it to be supposed that the exporter could go to the shipowner, and say, " I have some goods that I propose to send to Australia by your ships, but I must stipulate first of all that you shall employ only **British** seamen " ?

* He would be perfectly agreeable to employ only **British** seamen if the exporter would guarantee that he would be able to find a purely **British** crew, and also undertake to pay any increased cost that might be incurred in obtaining one.

* As the honorable and learned member for West Sydney has pointed out, the proposal would not confer any benefit whatever upon the **British** nation from a preference stand-point, because if a **British** ship-owner were unable to obtain a **British** crew to man his vessels, and were compelled to fall back upon foreigners, the shipper of the goods would lose all the advantage which it is sought to bestow upon him by this alleged preference.

* It is a preference in name only, because the bulk of the trade upon which Great Britain is supposed to receive a preference is already in **British** hands.

* There should not be a power to force measures through by a tyrannical and autocratic suppression of the right of free speech - a method which hitherto we, as Britishers, or descendants of the **British** race, have been taught to regard with feelings of the utmost repugnance and as being peculiar to institutions of a Continental or Eastern character, and utterly foreign to those of **British** origin.

* I take it that those of us who, though born in Australia, belong to the **British** race, have within us the inherent instinct to love liberty and the free expression of opinion.

* W. E. Gladstone convened a special session to enable the **British** House of Commons to consider proposed standing orders for the limitation of debate, and, although that body ife now governed bv a standing order similar to that which is being proposed bv the Prime Minister, it was brought forward under circumstances which allowed its calm and full discus.sion.

* As I have said, the standing order providing for* the closure was, dealt with by the **British** House of Commons in a special session, whereas, in this instance, it has been proposed in the midst of the discussion of a measure of vital importance, affecting the rights, liberties, and, indeed, the very lives of a large majority of the industrial population.

* Therefore, I think that we must retain for a considerable time the right of appeal in ordinary matters of commercial and business law, arid of general law, to the one Court of Appeal for the whole of the **British** Dominions.

* It has been said by the Honorable B. P. Wise, a gentleman very closely allied with the Attorney-General and with the Prime Minister, that the referendum is opposed not only to the principles of representative government, but to the very spirit of the **British** Constitution, and undoubtedly we now have presented to us a method of governing through the press and public meetings, for  in no  other way could the J  Judiciary  feel the impress of public opinion.

* The Attorney-General knows perfectly well that it is only by fighting against " stone walls " that the **British** nation has advanced .

* 1  do not believe that any court in the **British** Empire has ever been guilty of corruption, and therefore to argue that in America the Federal Court is incorruptible, is to say nothing.

* They found that the draftsman of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill had borrowed from the English Merchandise Marks Act a number of provisions al together inapplicable to our circumstances, and other provisions included in the Englist Act, apparently in order to dovetail into existing **British** legislation, which could not be dovetailed into our different legislation.

* I say that the **British** Merchandise Marks Act dealt with matters which the present Government have not found it necessary to include in this Commerce Bill.

* In the **British** Parliament there are Law Committees.

* It should be remembered that the Executive power, called an Act of State, cannot be exercised to prevent the immigration of **British** subjects.

* **British** Chambers, 39 Queen-street, 
In reference to your advertisement in the  Commonwealth Gazette,  that you will receive tenders in Adelaide on the21stSeptembernextfor telegraph material, as verbally explained to you today, I beg leave to point out that on a former occasion, when I tendered for such material, although my price was the lowest, my tender was declined, on the ground that you were giving the preference to goods of **British** manufacture.

* As I am agent here for Messrs. John A. Roeblings, Sons and Co., of New York, and would be offering their well-known manufactures, I have been asked by these friends whether it is still your intention to give a preference as regards price for **British** goods.

* In an article like copper wire, the difference in price between **British** or other manufacture would only amount to a few shillings per ton, so you can see there is no room for any margin, and if there was such a preference given, my friends would not care to go to the expense of cabling over their tender.

* As the writer says the difference in price between **British** and American wire is small, I think he may be informed that we intend to take the **British** article.

* I put on one side altogether, in any parallel that might be drawn, the position 'of South Africa and the position of Canada, foi- although we have in these countries two great integral parts of the **British** Empire, one federated and the other probably about to be federated, their local  surroundings  are absolutely different from those of Australia.

* We are an island continent, and we are different from almost every other offshoot of the **British** Empire.

* The whole of this great I continent has been peopled almost entirely " with a purely **British** stock.

* On the other hand we must recollect the great and impressive fact that we are a people situated practically in the eastern seas, and that we have a continent of such enormous proportions that whilst the southern parts have a climate suitable to the **British** people, one-half of our territory is either tropical or sub-tropical.

* Further, when we go a little north of Port Darwin we find in the Malay Peninsula, in all parts, either under the protection or within the sphere of influence of the **British** Empire, hundreds of thousands of Chinese and people of kindred nationalities practically carrying on the commerce and forming the most industrious element in the populations of these countries- Now, the question that naturally arises in dealing with a Bill like this is what is the object we have in view.

* I cannot, however, shut my eyes to the fact that the large majority of the people of Australia, backed up by nearly all the representatives of the people of Queensland, have given it as their unfaltering opinion that, no matter what measures are necessary, Australia must be kept pure for the **British** race who have begun to inhabit it.

* We have to consider it as a people forming a part of the **British** Empire, an empire which is so large and so comprehensive that it contains amongst its citizens men of all colours and of all classes.

* Our difficulty, therefore, whilst part of the **British** Empire - or even if we were an independent State - in dealing with a question so serious and so real is to arrange so that we can keep out the undesirable elements without doing injury to those international interests, without which no great country can live and trade.

* I hold that if we are perfectly sure that a certain policy is necessary to uphold the purity of the race of Australia - if a certain policy is necessary in order that the civilization of a purely **British** character implanted on our shores shall be continued as the population increases, until we become in the future a great populous country - I do not think we should hesitate, for one moment, under the peculiar circumstances of the case - with our position in these south-eastern seas, open to millions of these servile and alien people - to say to Great Britain, "Tin's is a problem which you and we have to face, and the more straightforwardly, and the more honestly we face it the better for the future."

* Every one of us, no matter what our individual views may be, must feel, especially belonging as we do to the race which has been more broad-minded, more cosmopolitan, and more adventurous than any other race the world has known, that in attempting to shut out any human beings from our shores and from the privileges of .**British** freedom, we are doing a very extreme act.

* We are, no doubt, under peculiar exigencies and under special local circumstances, reversing that great principle of **British** freedom and **British** refuge.

* I hope -we shall never lose that proud distinction, which I hold to be a distinction greater than any in the world - "I am a **British** citizen."

* But if I thought that we had to put in the scales, on the one side, the **British** connexion with certain restrictions on our autonomous government, and the populating with South Carolinas many portions of the northern parts of the continent, and on the other side a disjointed empire, I would unreservedly make my choice.

* What we mean, in the view of all Australia at the present time, is that we will prevent any large infiltration of alien elements into the component parts of our national life, and that we will preserve pure- for all time the **British** element with which we started.

* In the first place, we have **British** subjects, within 200 miles of London, who have never spoken a word of English in their lives - Welshmen.

* Then we have the French Canadians, who are some of the best citizens, of the **British** Empire.

* I said in my opening remarks - and nobody can bemore seized of the difficulties and dangers of the position than I am - that  -Ave  are a component part of the **British** Empire, which ismade up of all sorts of races and classes of men.

* these difficulties, arise, and that we are a part of the **British** Empire renders it all the more necessary at.

* this initial stage of our Commonwealth lifethat we should meet these difficulties straightout, face to face, and that we should tell the-' Imperial Government that although we desire to cling to the **British** connexion for all time we must not be hampered by these conditions which arise out of our union with theEmpire.

* But those responsibilities are there, and the **British** race will never shirk them.

* i am practically quoting what  Mr. Chamberlain  said, and what requires no quotation, because it has been the thorough understanding of that principle by the statesmen of England during the last 30 years, which has made possible the union of the **British** Empire.

* If it had not been for the slack hand, and the desire that the same self-government which Englishmen enjoy should be enjoyed by us within our own domain, if there had ' been any attempt to interfere with it, Australia might not to-day be united with the **British** Empire.

* Let us throw on the **British** Government the necessity of saying whetherit is possible for us to deal with it in thisway or not.

* Let us tell the **British** Government that we are confronted with a great difficulty, not arisingout of our connexion with the Empire somuch as out of our position in these southern seas.

* I an* alluding to Frenchmen, Germans, and others,, who, we may be sure, will never come here in very great numbers - certainly never in numbers sufficient to in any way interfere with the original **British** stock - but who if this Bill is carried out as it may have to be carried out in order to secure its object, will be absolutely shut out.

* In order to justify this absolutely impossible clause, which requires that every immigrant must be able to write in English, the right honorable gentleman said - 
Surely that would be a retrograde movement on the part of the **British** people.

* Let us tell the **British** Government that we do not intend under any circumstances to let these people come into Australia.

* Let us say not only that we are perfectly aware that our union with the **British** Government creates a difficulty that it is very hard to get over ; but that we trust to the **British** Government to give us fair consideration in this difficulty.

* .- This sum is altogether inadequate to grant relief to the **British** settlers in the New Hebrides.

* The Commonwealth authorized steps to be taken by a steam-ship company to acquire land in the New Hebrides - practically on behalf of the Government - with the object of inducing men from Australia to cultivate it, and with the idea of establishing an effective **British** occupation of the group.

* The **British** settlers in the New Hebrides have from time to time complained of the Commonwealth Government, and addressed petitions for relief to the Prime Minister and other Australian citizens, while the missionaries have also raised their voices on their behalf, and letters have appeared in the public newspapers setting forth the drawbacks under which they labour.

* We could relieve their distresses .more effectually than by giving this miserable dole- if we removed the duties on island produce grown by **British** planters- I have on more than one occasion urged that step, and have on the business-paper a notice of motion affirming the desirability of such action, which, I am 1 afraid, will not now be reached this session.

* If the Government are really anxious to afford substantial relief to the **British** settlers in the New Hebrides, they should grant them a rebate upon the duties imposed upon the produce sent by them to the Australian market.

* The Government, instead of proposing a paltry  vote of 500, which is ridiculously small when we consider the number of persons whose necessities it is intended to relieve, should have taken steps to provide a market for the products of **British** residents in the New Hebrides.

* In view of probable commercial developments along the whole Pacific trade route, it is desirable that we should induce **British** settlers to make their homes in the New Hebrides.

* I would point out that the reference to " **British** coins " in sub-clause 1 makes it possible for the Indian rupee to become legal tender in Australia, because under the definition clause " 1 **British** coins ' means coins which have been issued in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom."

* The Indian rupee, and other coins equally objectionable, issued in certain parts of the **British** Empire, have undoubtedly been issued "in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom."

* It is distinctly a **British** coin as defined in the Bill.

* It only gets its authority to circulate in India from the **British** Parliament, so that it must have been issued in accordance with the law of the United Kingdom.

* A Coinage Act has been published as part of the Imperial Statutes, and the late Chief Justice Higinbotham appended to it the following note :  - 
Section 19 gives power to any **British** Possession to apply it.

* I shall be satisfied if the Attorney-General will promise to strengthen the definition clause so as to make " **British** coins " in this clause cover only coins that are legal tender in the United Kingdom, or make some amendment in the clause itself.

* The Attorney-General has not copied the concluding paragraph of the corresponding section in the **British** Act, which is as follows :  - 
And a note issued by any Australian bank is a legal tender, unless when tendered it is declined on the  ground that it is not.

* The AttorneyGeneral might consider the point that the draftsman of the **British** Statute has inserted in it the provision to which I have referred.

* Because, by doing so, we should depart from what is the statute law, and the recognised custom of the whole of the **British** Empire.

* I consider that the amount of money that we are asked tocontribute to the **British** Government for the protection that we are to ' receive is proportionately altogether inadequate to the protection afforded.

* In  Mr. Chamberlain's  address to the representatives of the Commonwealth, and of the other **British** colonies, he made a most pointed comparison between the expenditure which waa being incurred by the taxpayers of Great Britain and that incurred by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth.

* which has been initiated by the Federal Government at all, but a policy which has been conceived and nurtured in the office of the **British** Admiralty.

* How would honorable members regard a proposal which had for its object recruiting for the **British** Army in Australia  t  I have no doubt that it would be strongly resisted.

* I remember that, at the time of the  South African War, when it was reported that certain officers were in Australia for the purpose of recruiting for the **British** Forces, very strong representations were made to the Prime Minister, who undertook to stop any recruiting that might be going on.

* So far as the effectiveness of the **British** Navy is concerned, I do not think any one could take exception to such concentration, but we have to remember that these ships were withdrawn, the coasts of Australia would be at the mercy of any stray cruiser that might come along.

* I should like to ask whether, in the event of Great Britain being engaged in a naval war, either with a combination of powers or a single power, the **British** fleet would be entirely withdrawn from the  English  Channel  1  Would her shores be left exposed to the attacks of an enemy ?

* Yet we are asked to ratify an agreement which gives the **British** Admiralty power to withdraw this fleet to parts remote from Australia - perhaps 1,000 miles away.

* If we devoted 400,000 per annum, or whatever sum we could afford, to the creation of an Australian Navy, it would mean, at any rate, an additional ship every year for the defence of the Empire, because, from what I know of the spirit of the Australian people, if the Empire were in need, and we had a navy of our own, we should at once place it at her disposal to act in concert with the **British** Navy.

* I do not agree with those who say that we shall have nothing at all to show for it, because I recognise that it will give us for a period of ten years the protection - to a limited extent, not to the extent I should like - of the **British** Navy.

* At the outset, no doubt, the ships of an Australian Navy would have to be commanded and officered by **British** naval officers, but a spirit of friendly rivalry and emulation, would, I think, spring up between the officers and men of the Australian and **British** war ships which would lead to good results.

* I have no means of forming an opinion of my own upon the subject, but I have heard very grave reflections cast upon the organization and administration of the **British** Admiralty authorities.

* I have read statements made by men who may be presumed to know what they are writing about, to the effect that the **British** Admiralty is not organized as it should be.

* We know that very serious mistakes were made by the **British** War Office during the South African war.

* As an instance, I may remind honorable members that when our first offer of troops was made to 1 he **British** authorities they cabled back that unmounted men would be preferred.

* Then we had the admission of one of the members of the **British** Government, not many months ago, that the **British** blundered through that war somehow.

* Severe criticisms were also passed by one who was on the spot all the time, upon the tactics of the **British** officers during the Boer war.

* This is some of the criticism upon the **British** Admiralty to which I refer - 
There are two great defects in the organization and administration of the **British**  navy  - 
I am not vain enough ' to think that the **British** Admiralty, are likely to pay me the compliment of taking notice of what I say here, but the matter is one which should be looked into.

* If we divide the duties in the way I have suggested - if Australia takes upon herself the duty of maintaining these lands for the **British** race, and if Canada, New Zealand, and other **British** possessions, follow the same lines, the Empire as a whole undertaking to keep open and to preserve all the trade routes and ocean highways over which the surplus population of Britain is to flow to these distant possessions, and through which trade and commerce is to flow back to her -  -then  we shall really specialise in such .

* In the first place, whilst upon every matter which affects any ; part of the Empire it is the undoubted right of every **British** subject to express his opinions - whilst he has the right to appear upon any platform to ventilate any grievances - when we seek to express our opinions, not in our individual capacity, but as embodying the views of Parliament, and as representing the voice and judgment of the people, we have one or two preliminary questions to consider.

* For example, we have the deepest interest in the legislation which is enacted by the **British** Parliament, but have we the power, or the right, to interfere with the processes of that legislation?

* I repeat, we must draw the sharpest possible line between, the right which we enjoy as individual subject's of the King to express, in any way we please, our opinions upon any question coming within the wide range of Imperial politics, and the proposition that this House should make an official representation to the **British** Parliament upon a question which is not an Australian question, and one that excites the most vital differences of opinion in the three kingdoms - a question which has divided people in the mother country as very few great questions have done.

* We have not been sent here to interfere with the people or Parliament of the United Kingdom upon any matter of domestic concern, or in regard to any alteration of the **British** parliamentary system.

* I ask honorable members to regard just for a moment the immovable respect of that mighty Mother of Parliaments - the **British** House of Commons - for the self-governing rights of the dependencies to which she gave the freedom which attaches, or ought to attach, to parliamentary institutions.

* How tempted the **British** Parliament must have been to address petitions to the King in.

* We make our appearance in the presence of King Edward, and constitute ourselves his advisers in regard to the shape that a **British** political agitation should take.

* It was a natural and manly desire, springing from the genius of the **British** race, that led us to demand a change - to desire to exchange for the despotism of the person sent out from the mother country some system of parliamentary government.

* Ireland may not value her position in the Imperial Parliament ; but the fact remains that on the only basis that the  democracy  of the Empire acknowledges - the basis of manhood and womanhood, the basis of population - she has a larger share of representation to-day in the **British** Parliament than have the people of England or of Scotland.

* I am  asuming  that they are content to remain within the United Kingdom, and that they do not wish to break off their connexion with the **British** Parliament.

* On that basis I say that the **British** Parliament is one in which' Ireland holds a fair share of representation.

* It would be just as wise to ask that Scotland should dominate the **British** Parliament while she remains one of the three kingdoms, as it would be to ask that Ireland should do so.

* If the people of Ireland at such a time had risen in rebellion and cast off the **British** yoke, no man who respects human rights would have said that they were not entitled to do so.

* No one can forget the grand part that Gladstone, played in redeeming the character of the **British** people in their dealings with Ireland - no one can forget that mighty effort which disestablished the dominant .church, then representing only a fraction of the people.

* I regard the question of Home Rule for Ireland as one which must be left for determination to the good sense and intelligence of the 41,000,000 of the **British** people.

* As a **British** subject, he can hold meetings to advocate it, he can write articles in support of it, and he can seek to influence the people upon in every conceivable way.

* There is nopossibility of a separation between England' and Ireland so long as the **British** Empirelasts ; it is inconceivable.

* I leave it to them to settle this great problem, which affects the happiness and welfare of the Irish and **British** people.

* So ardent has been the desire even of the resolute opponents of Home Rule, the Conservative Party of England, to do some long delayed measure of justice to Ireland that the principles of **British** legislation have  been  strained to breaking point in favour, not of the dominant power of the landlords and tenants of the great rural districts of England and Scotland, but of the people of Ireland.100,000,000 of **British** money have been pledged to place the Irish landlords and tenants in a position that **British** landlords and tenants have never occupied and never will occupy.

* The honorable member's statement might apply to a few fortunate gentlemen who have large estates in Ireland, but that daring departure from all maxims of **British** law in reference to the ownership of land would have been impossible if it had not proceeded from a generous impulse of the whole **British** people.

* Because this House confidently relies upon the fairness and wisdom of the **British** people for the removal of every just Irish grievance in the manner most likely to promote the welfare of the Irish people and the stability of the Empire."

* The rifles were supplied as ordered, viz., the latest War Office pattern, as issued to the **British** Army.

* The **British** Proprietary mine made a profit of 23,000, being able, during that time, to obtain an average price of 17 per ton for their lead.

* Honorable members are, doubtless, aware that one part of that Bill dealt with the whole of the coasting trade of Australia, whether undertaken by Australian ships, by **British** ships not coming within the scope of the Constitution, or by foreign vessels.

* **British** ships, the Queen's ships of war excepted, whose first port of clearance, and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth.

* I do not think that either the provision in the Navigation Bill, or any provision which may be put into this Bill, can possibly give jurisdiction over ocean-going vessels, whether foreign or **British**.

* The term "coasting trade" has never been defined  by  the Legislature; but the Courts have held that in the following cases vessels were not engaged in the coastal trade: - (i)'a vessel which, after making a voyage from Calcutta to London -  that is from one part of the **British** Dominion to another -  proceeded to Liverpool ;  that is exactly the case in point put by the honorable and learned member.

* a vessel which, in the course of her voyage to a foreign port, proceeded from one port ' to another in Great Britain for the purpose of completing her cargo ; (3) a vessel which arrived from a foreign port, and discharged one part of her cargo at one port in Great Britain, and proceeded with the residue to another port in the **British** Isles. '

* Under the present measure the provision is made to apply only to cases in which a **British** ship begins and concludes her voyage within the  limits  of the Commonwealth.

* They may be in a better position; because, in section 736 of the  Merchant  Shipping Act, sub-section  c,  there is a provision that, while we have power as regards **British** ships, our powers in regard to foreign ships are subject to treaty rights created prior to 1869.

* Therefore foreign ships may have a right to come here without being subject to the limitations which we can place upon **British** ships.

* I do not think there can be any good in proceeding with "the amendment of which I have given notice, because my amendment is to the effect that we cannot, either in this Bill or in a Navigation Bill, touch ocean-going vessels, whether foreign or **British**.

* The  delegates turn now to the suggested' amendment of clause 5, by the omission of the part of that clause which prescribes that " laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all **British** ships, the Queen's ships of war excepted, whose first port of clearance, and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth."'

* Under the present measure the provision is made to apply only to cases in which a **British** ship begins and concludes her voyage within the limits of the Commonwealth.

* This is not a question of coasting tradeIt is dealing with clauses applying to **British** ships trading to and from the Commonwealth.

* But section  20  of the Federal Council Act applied to every **British** ship which commenced her voyage in any one of the Colonies concerned,, and also to any **British** ship which concluded her voyage in any one of them.

* In the former case the Federal Council law would apply to a **British** ship on the whole of her voyage from.

* Australia to a port beyond the Commonwealth - in the latter case to a **British** ship on the whole of her voyage from any point beyond the Commonwealth to Australia.

* What is a layman - a man of peace - who does not care to board a vessel even for the purpose of making a short trip, to say to a proposal to expend a large sum upon defence, seeing that every plan brought forward by the **British** Government has been " riddled" by experts?

* We were able to refer to the valuable reports based upon inquiries by committees of the House of Commons and commissions appointed by the **British** Government, and were able to read evidence given on the subject by men of the highest position in the commercial and financial world at home.

* It is quite true that the latest **British** Committee, while acknowledging the value of the decimal system as compared with the present system, did not, on the ground of expediency, advocate its being brought into operation.

* The chaplain and other officers of a **British** regiment in New South Wales actually received their salaries in the form of certificates for rum.

* Now we have the **British** coinage, which is undoubtedly a good example of the mixed duodecimal system.

* That, however, does not establish the fact that there is no better system than the **British**.

* Then the Treasurer objected that the adoption of the decimal system by Australia before its adoption by Great Britain would cause great difficulty in transforming **British** money into our money.

* The evidence which the committee had from witnesses who had been brought up under the **British** system and had latterly lived under the decimal system, was the strongest in favour of the latter, each witness declaring that he would not dream of desiring to return to our mixed coinage.

* Amongst some of the members of the committee there was a predilection in favour of the American dollar, but it was found that the **British** sovereign is too closely interwoven with the affairs of the United Kingdom - that it is the coin of our records and our statistics - and that, even in countries beyond the **British** Isles, it has become an important standard of value.

* piece and the1, that the select committee were first forced to the conclusion that the better course was to adopt the **British** sovereign as a basis.

* Then there is a great probability that some other countries adopting the decimal system will recognise the supremacy of the **British** sovereign, and make it the standard of value.

* We have been told by the honorable member for South Sydney that in Peru and Ecuador, of which the select committee knew nothing at the time their report was issued, the **British** sovereign has been adopted as the standard and reorganized as currency.

* That is evidence of the trend of future decimalization, and of the strength of the position that the **British** sovereign has acquired, partly by its size, weight, and suitability as a coin, but, more than all, by its containing a full 20s.

* All that calculation, which is a very difficult thing with our system, is simplified so much that any one having the parts of a machine on that system once, will not have **British** parts.

* Of course **British** people are conservative.

* The only question is, when will it go  1  When it does go, I believe there will be a decimalization of **British** weights, measures, and money, and from the reports of the **British** committees and the evidence afforded by the adoption of the florin and the position of the sovereign I have not the slightest doubt that the decimal system which we propose now must ultimately be accepted by Great Britain.

* Yes ; the declarations of **British** Chambers of Commerce have been in favour of its adoption.

* We got very little information in return, and the great strength of our report lies in the evidence which we had available in the statements made before **British** commissions and committees by some of the most able men on such questions in the Empire.

* It would be desirable in that case to, as early as possible, have the present **British** minted coins withdrawn.

* The committee also recommend that we should not coin our own gold so long as we use the **British** sovereign.

* The **British** Government are very particular, even though they lose by the coinage of sovereigns, in requiring that they shall be able to guarantee their soundness and value by conducting the coinage under their own officers.

* If we can do anything to push forward what will be of value to the **British** people, that should prove an additional reason for our adoption of the system.

* English committees, in spite of the difficulties there, and in spite of the greater importance of the change in its effects upon the people, came to the conclusion that the proposed system ought to be adopted by the **British** people.

* I have come to the same conclusion as did the House of Commons, which unanimously passed a resolution to the effect that the introduction of the florin had been a success, and that it should be followed up by a further decimalization of the **British** coinage.

* One of the **British** committees which found that, in spite of the difficulties which might surround the introduction of the decimal system in Great Britain, it was a matter which should be undertaken at the earliest possible moment was not a small one, nor was it unrepresentative or unintelligent.

* It comprised some of the hardest-headed business men in the **British** Empire, men of thought, education, learning, and position.

* They found as our committee, and prior **British** committees appointed to deal with the subject, found.

* As a matter of fact, only one **British** Commission has reported against the reform.

* This proposal has not been submitted in any jocular spirit; we intend that the question of the prohibition of the liquor .traffic in **British** New Guinea shall be a live one so far as the temperance party are concerned.

* I am surprised to read the arguments advanced by some of the missionaries and traders in **British** New Guinea with reference to this question.

* I am sorry that we are considering the application of prohibition to **British** New Guinea, and not to the whole of Australia.

* Yet 7354  Papua (**British**  [REPRESENTATIVES.]

* We find in one part of the report of the Administrator a statement to this effect - 

 Papua (**British** [23 November, 1904.]

* A great responsibility rests uponus in regard to the natives in **British** New Guinea, and we should consider their interests as of the first importance.

* In some respects, and very largely, I agree with the patriotic sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Maranoa, I do say that, placed as we are as outposts of the **British** race in these southern seas, we must recognise our responsibilities and our destinies.

* We practically have all the  colonizable land  in this part of the world, and we know that other nations are settling in the islands of the Pacific, not merely for some 'advantage of gain which they may obtain by trade or cultivation, but - and this is the real force behind their action in most cases - to occupy naval bases from which to make an attack upon the **British** colonies in the event of war with Great Britain.

* We do not wish to take, by force of arms or  any  unjust method, territories that belong to other powers : but the **British** people and Government are apt to forget in these, various adjustments which we have seen take place the importance of these Pacific matters unless the Commonwealth Government is there to submit them at such times when there is an opportunity, by exchange or other settlement, of getting possession of,,t any rate, those islands which are within dangerous distance of our coast.

* they could deal with if we passed the motion as it is : they can deal with the leasing of land, the punishment of crime, the general administration under control, if it is granted by the **British** Government.

* That this House authorizes the Government to accept control of **British** New Guinea, if His Majesty's Government are willing to place it under Federal control.

* Under those words, we should give the Government authority to accept control for the **British** Government without going so far 4is to empower them to accept the islands as a territory.

* We wish to know how the **British** Government is going to regard the territories of the _ Commonwealth.

* Is there behind the Commonwealth in dealing with these territories the **British** Government?

* For instance, if the Germans choose to take an area of land on Our border in New Guinea, are we in the dispute with Germany, to have the support of the **British** navy  1 
As regards these outside territories, which are a different matter, the **British** Government might say - " We cannot go to war over this dispute ; you yourself will have to settle it with Germany."

* Then, are we to obtain this control with our present contribution, or with a larger contribution to the **British** Government?

* I hardly think that the remarks which have been made as to the meanness of the **British** Government in this matter are fair.

* The **British** Government were wrong - as they are always apt to be wrong in connexion with these distant territories - in not taking possession of the whole of New Guinea except the Dutch portion.

* I do not like begging appeals to the **British** Government, such as was made in connexion with the contribution of 7,000.

* The **British** Government had good reason for saying to us " Manage this yourself Their desire has been to obtain a sufficient amount of revenue from New Guinea to cover the expenditure, but the colonies stepped in and prevented them from doing so.

* Therefore the **British** Government were quite right in saying, " We cannot manage New Guinea at this distance.

* That was a proper position for the **British** Government to assume, and we should never have necessitated their writing to us and stating that while 7,000 was of great importance to us, it was of much more importance to them, owing to the enormous sum they were spending for the support of the colonies in other directions.

* I do not think it was mean of the **British** Government to tell us to govern New Guinea ourselves.

* That this House authorizes the Government to accept the responsibility of taking over from the State of Queensland, the control of **British** New Guinea, - 
There are two points - that the control should be taken over without there being anything specified as to the nature of the control, and that any financial responsibility which the Commonwealth undertakes should expire at the end of the financial year of 1-902.

* It will be necessary for us to undertake the control of **British** New Guinea as a territory.

* Whatever we may do ourselves - whether we break away from the Imperial union or not - whatever remains of the **British** Empire will be entitled to defence at the hands of the whole of the **British** Empire.

* could be no administration on our part unless the Imperial Government were ready to pass either a statute or an Order in Council to enable us to undertake the management of the affairs of **British** New Guinea.

* It may be necessary for us - I will not bind myself to it - to pass an Act of Parliament before we can even accept **British** New Guinea.

* I recognise my responsibility, which is not to accept the government of the territory of .**British** New Guinea without first passing through both Houses - if they will pass it - a statute accepting that responsibility.

* Paragraph (1) of the motion would then read: - 
That this House is willing to join in measures for the acceptance of **British** New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth.

* If we had imported kanakas, we could have produced1 sugar as cheaply in the Northern Territory as it has been produced in  Queensland, and we passed an Act providing for the importation of **British** subjects from India.

* Honorablemembers call themselves Britishers and lovers of fair-play, and everywhere we hear **British** fair-play spoken of and applauded, but I would ask if this is **British** fair-play ?

* No formal invitation to a **British** Fleet or to the Admiralty is called for, seeing that the Fleet isconstantly moving from place to place within the Empire.

* But, as a matter of fact, for a long time past, successive Governments, including this Government, have conveyed to the Admiralty the general desire of the Australian people for a more imposing display of **British** naval power than we have hitherto been privileged to witness.

* I feel sure that the Admiralty are thoroughly seized of the fact that the most cordial welcome possible would be given to a visit of any **British** Fleet to these waters.

* But, so far, we have felt that, having given these assurances that a visit at any time of any **British** Fleet of any size will be most cordially welcomed by the whole of Australia - that we should be most anxious to receive, and feel honored by their visit - we have taken all the steps desirable, seeing that we are addressing our Mother Country, and not an outside Power.

* He has suggested, however, that if there had been no such condition, the **British** Government might have come to the assistance of the Australian people by contributing part of the increased subsidy for which his company felt compelled for other reasons to ask.

* I should like to know from those who are so anxious that the **British** taxpayer shall not be saddled with expense for the benefit of the Commonwealth, and have proposed that our subsidy to the Navy shall be increased by 100 per cent., what they think of that suggestion ?

* Would they allow the **British** taxpayer to bear a portion of the expense of providing us.

* If honorable members will refer back to the debates which took place upon the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act for the employment of white crews upon mail steamers, they will see that its advocates did not propose it as a mere supplement to the White Australia policy, but with the object of encouraging the employment of **British** sailors in the mercantile marine.

* The honorable and learned member for West Sydney, in speaking upon the matter in 1901, quoted some statements made by Lord Brassey to the effect that the proportion of sailors in the **British** mercantile marine had, during the preceding twenty-five years, decreased to the extent of 50 per cent.

* Whereas twentyfive years previously 200,000 **British** seamen had found employment upon **British** merchant vessels, the number had dwindled down to 100,000, and was still rapidly decreasing.

* The most recent statistics show that the decrease in the number of **British** seamen is proceeding at an alarming rate, and that the conditions are such as to c'ause the greatest concern to statesmen, who have any conception of the probable needs of the Empire in the event of Great Britain becoming involved in war.

* The object of  initiating a white ocean policy was to insure that **British** seamen should be employed upon the mail steamers subsidized by the Commonwealth, and I feel sure that 'our action in that regard will meet with the approval of all well-wishers of the Empire.

* We found there a few **British** officers and a crew composed mainly of Cingalese.

* We have built up a navy which is the pride of the **British** people and the admiration of foreign nations, and we are blindly endangering our prospects of being ' able to- maintain, it by substituting for **British** seamen foreigners and Asiatics.

* responsible for the change now being brought about in our mercantile marine will eventually prove the greatest weakness in the **British** Empire.

* As indicating that the employment of **British** sailors is decreasing, I would point to the returns showing the number of youths indentured as apprentices on sea-going vessels.

* Thisgreat reduction shows that the **British** tar is gradually disappearing from our mercantile marine.

* In Canada, under section 37 of the **British** North American Act 1867, the provision is - 
Exactly ; but the steam-ship companies appear to think that they have the Commonwealth at their mercy.

* Let the world know what Australia can produce, what her climate really is, and let us send samples of our products, not only to the **British** Isles, but to the Continent of Europe.

* Some of our best settlers have come from Germany, Denmark, and other Continental countries, and we should not confine our efforts to the **British** Isles.

* I wish to know whether the Prime Minister has read the cablegrams published in this morning's newspapers, with reference to the discussion that has taken place in Great Britain upon  the subject of Imperial defence, and whether he can see his way to adopt means .to place before the **British** public, from time to time, the true Australian position, thereby dispelling the grotesque misapprehensions which have arisen.

* The Prime Minister admitted that at the last elections a majority was returned in favour of preferential trade, but the matter has been discussed by him and the others whom I have mentioned, not from the Australian stand-point, on which we are capable of expressing an opinion, but from the **British** stand-point,, with which **British** people alone can deal.

* The honorable member for New England, since there are such, men" as Lord Rosebery in the world, might have saved himself the trouble of championing the cause of the people of England, and the honorable member for Grey, great as are his abilities and magnificent his vocabulary, might have trusted  Mr. Asquith  to place before **British** audiences that aspect of the case over which he laboured so hard.

* It was obviously because Australians are in favour of preferential trade that these speakers addressed themselves to the subject from the **British** point of view.

* I should like to ask the honorable member for Parramatta whether it is fair that the sugar industry - throughout the **British** Empire should be broken down by the strength and wealth of the German Government?

* May  I point out that the foreigner has never considered **British** industries.

* I have already shown that it is impossible for the **British** people to get back to the position which they occupied in 1846, and which was depicted by the Prime Minister in his speech last .

* If there be any individual so demented as to believe that Australia has any future except as a part of the **British** Empire, I should like to hear from him, because he must possess the sort of intellect that one would expect to find in a free import camp, but nowhere else.

* And so with regard to the **British** nation.

* We are certainly not insulting the foreigner by asking that the **British** nation shall lock its doors, and open them only to its friends.

* He appealed to the **British** statesmen to allow the matter to be inquired into - just as we propose that the desirableness of preferential trade shall be considered - and if that course had been adopted it would have changed the whole face of the Anglo-Saxon world.

* The basis of the whole question is whether the members of the **British** Empire are to trade as far as possible among themselves ; whether the sons of Britishers in Australia and other parts of the Empire are to grow the raw material for our industries as far as possible, and give the weight of their .patronage to the **British** market.

* What  Mr. Chamberlain  said was that the sons of Empire, producing in far-distant lands, pushing forward the boundaries of her domain, developing the waste places, and holding as fortresses and citadels of the Empire places like Australia and Cape Colony, were entitled to special consideration, and had special claims on the **British** people.

* So we shall think all the better of the English people if they give us a preference over the foreigner, and they will think all the better of us if we allow them an entrance to our markets which we refuse to peoples outside the **British** confederation..

* Honorable members must remember that butter, wheat, and other produce is at present pouring into the **British** markets from all parts of the world,  so  that there is great danger that our exportations may be submerged.

* It has been urged time and again that the States should have the right to coin their own silver, but the utmost that the **British** Government would concede was to hand over to the States the profits made upon their coinage.

* But the real reason urged by the **British** Government against conceding to the States the right to mint their own silver was that they might be tempted in time of necessity to over-issue, in order to gain the profit resulting therefrom.

* With regard to the proposed profit by minting the silver, I take it that it cannot be intended that we should request the **British** Government to immediately call in the whole of the existing coinage so as to enable us to issue new coins, and in that way secure the profit of 1,000,000 or 1,250,000, to which reference has been made.

* That seems to be the last occasion upon which the matter was investigated in Great Britain, although different motions relating to it have been moved in the **British** Parliament.

* It is not the "Yes,  Mr. Chamberlain,"  reason, or any such absurdity, which induces me to object to a system which is different from thatof Great Britain; my great objection to the change is that if our system is not the same as that of the old country, our children must unquestionably be taught two systems, the **British** and the Australian, so that they may be fitted to deal with both when they enter upon the business of life.

* Yes ; but my point is that if Australia adopts the decimal, system, and Great Britain does not, our children will have to learn both the **British** and the Australian systems to enable them to deal with the accounts which pass between the two countries.

* The position of the **British** Government is that there is no general demand for a change, and that it is hardly right to make a change which would so largely affect the whole people until they had expressed the opinion that they desired it.

* Without any reference to  Mr. Chamberlain  I contend that we should not alter our system  unless .the **British** Government can also be induced to alter theirs.

* As far as I can judge, without the knowledge of an expert, I should say that, of the existing systems, the dollar and cent of the United States is the best, the smallness of the unit in that of the Latin union being cumbersome for the gigantic operations of **British** commerce.

* I think great difficulties would arise if the penny with its present value (that is 1 -240th part of the **British** sovereign) were not retained.

* I take it that we are part of the **British** Empire, and that our coinage mustbe more or less similar to the  coinage of the  **British** Empire.

* I do not think that any system has been received with favour by the **British** people.

* The **British**.

* Government has not yet seen its way to adopt any of the proposed international units, viz., the 25 franc unit, the ten franc unit, or the farthing (the Anglo-Saxon unit),- because each one involves a change in the **British** gold standard of value.

* But these efforts have been fruitless, and foe the following reasons :  - 
How does the **British** system of coinage work amongst the continental nations.

* We might even go the length of  urging  the **British** Government to reconsider the question, and see whether a change could not be carried out.

* So, too, were other **British** companies.

* All male inhabitants of Australia (excepting those who are exempted by the regulations) who have resided therein for six months and are **British** subjects shall be liable to be trained.

* Some honorable members tell us that we need not spend much money on defence, because we can rely upon the **British** Navy to protect us.

* - I agree with the honorable member for Corio that, if we cannot place on our coinage any words that we think fit, provided that we do not interfere in any way with the **British** Government, Parliament might as well close down and hand over the government of the Commonwealth to the **British** Legislature.

* I do not know where the Government propose to get the 2,000,000; but to borrow for a defence policy is to make a departure from sound principles of finance on which no **British** Government would venture.

* Thefishermen of Canada have the great **British** market as well as those of the United.

* If we are not to be overwhelmed, we must take such action as will secure this country to us, although we hope that it will always remain part of the **British** Empire, and one of the brightest possessions of the **British** Crown.

* I agree with the honorable and learned member for Corinella that it is necessary that the **British** Government should be made aware that the people of Australia are behind the movement, and that it is not merely a Ministerial question.

* He complained that the Prime Minister had not included Great Britain in a comprehensive scheme of Tariff reform designed to link the whole **British** Empire together against the world; yet almost in the same breath, he warned us of the dire consequences of a union of France, Germany, China, and other foreign countries in a kind of zollverein in opposition to us.

* Although the Ministry propose to grant a preference to **British** products, I find that under this treaty the duty on condensed milk imported from Great Britain and all countries other than New Zealand will be increased by 100 per cent.

* as against the **British** article, whilst increasing the duty as against the foreign article to ijd.

* That alteration would be absolutely consistent with the Ministerial policy of granting **British** products a preference in this market, and I do not think that New Zealand could offer any objection to it.

* On the other hand, the proposal embodied in the schedule would penalize the **British** article, and place it on an equal footing with the production of any foreign country.

* a lb., **British** milk a duty of id.

* The clause in the **British** Bill is as follows : - 
As a fact, he had a certificate with him.

* The Prime Minister has declared that there was no reason why the groom should obtain an exemption certificate, but when the honorable and learned member for Wannon asked him subsequently whether it was necessary that such certificates should 'be granted, he said " Yes, but they were not generally given to **British** people."

* The more I look at the section the more it seems to me to cut right across the doctrine of personal rights, which has been one of the choicest heritages of the **British** race for a thousand years past.

* The Prime Minister stated that it was necessary that a motion of this character should be carried, not to tell our own people that we were loyal, nor as a test of the loyalty of the people of Australia, but as a rebuttal of the charges that the European newspapers have for months and months heaped upon the **British** people and the **British** forces in South Africa.

* the Continent are fond of goading the **British** people in order to test the loyalty of the people of the colonies.

* My reply is that the history of Great Britain has always given the lie direct to statements of that character, and I am not prepared to believe that the nature of the **British** people has so entirely changed that they have descended to barbarism in the conduct of the war in South Africa.

* If the **British** have erred at all, it has been in following too far the dictates of humanity.

* The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has quoted historical facts in defence ofhis position, but if he had gone further he could have shown that upon every occasion the success of the **British** arms has been followed, not by tyranny and oppression, but by freedom of the fullest character, such as we enjoy in Australia to-day.

* If the colonies decided separately to send contingents to South Africa to assist the **British** forces, we are justified, while the necessity continues, in keeping up the contingents to their full strength.

* I do not wish to make capital out of the fact that a large majority of the Australians- have decided that the **British** power shall be paramount in South Africa.

* But am I to understand that the Prime Minister merely wishes the war to end on what is called the basis of a compromise, or, in accordance with the desires of the **British** Empire, by the annexation of the territories of the two States?

* So far as Italy is concerned, we know of the friendly relations which subsist between that country and Great Britain - we know that the Italian navy is practically the **British** navy - but the other great powers of Europe hate Great Britain with an undying hatred.

* I do not hesitate to vote for this motion on the ground that it may possibly lead to our embroilment in the quarrels of the **British** Empire, nor am I influenced against it by any considerations connected with the possibility of establishing a republican system of government in the Commonwealth.

* I question very much whether any people living under a system of republican Government are freer than those who enjoy the benefits of the **British** Constitution.

* I believe in giving to others the same as I receive from them, and I cannot do better than adopt the language of  Sir Edward  Grey, in describing as foul and filthy lies the statements which have been disseminated, not only against our soldiers, but against the citizens of the **British** Empire.

* I have been under **British** rule all my life, and I ask advocates on the other side, from Germany or France, whether they can make the same statement in regard to those countries or the Transvaal.

* The .Secretary of State for the Colonies is much decried, but although we may differ in our domestic policy, we ought to feel gratified that so strong a personality has charge of the interests of the **British** Empire.

* In my judgment every item which is mentioned therein is of minor importance compared with the question of our future trade relations with the **British** Empire.

* On the other hand, we who were parties to imposing taxation upon the goods of the Empire were never presumed to be really in touch with the great **British** people.

* Seeing that free-trade was to accomplish so much for nations separated by every conceivable barrier, one was naturally disappointed to find that it, in the opinion of the free-trader, would achieve so little for the **British** people.

* The House of Commons by a majority, and the House of Lords, by a majority of two to one, have decided that the conditions which at present obtain in regard to **British** trade are absolutely unjust.

* Still, ' honorable members opposite have now absolutely the audacity to take up the case from the **British** standpoint and to attempt to prove that the **British** Parliament is wrong.

* Does it not appear reasonable to suppose that the **British** people know their own business ?

* I 'have pointed out that the **British** people are a self-governing people, and in the centre of the Empire they have determined, in so far as it has been possible for them to determine, that free-trade is unsatisfactory.

* The people of the South African Confederation, if I may call it so, and the people even of **British** Guiana, have come to the same conclusion- as that arrived at by the Parliament of the mother country.

* In every part of the **British** Empire in which there are free institutions, or, as in **British** Guiana, anything approaching them, there is the desire that the sons of the Empire should trade fairly within the Empire, and allow the foreigner to look after himself.

* In the whole of the civilized **British** world they are almost alone; they remind one of a few solitary penguins.

* They sit there and claim for  themselves a higher order of intelligence than the rest of the people of the **British** world; but they absolutely refuse to give expression to any principle for our guidance in the solution of this difficult problem.

* There is not a market of the world open to the Australian producer but the **British** market.

* Not one of them contemplated preferential trade or free imports only for **British** goods.

* This means a deadly struggle for Australian butter in the **British** market.

* **British** is the only market in which our goods can be sold, must say - " Why allow the market to be ruled by the foreigner?"

* do so.. Their markets are closed against our ownas well as **British** products, and it is our business to negotiate with Great Britain, and to negotiate with our hands free and not tied behind our backs.

* The foreigner will not take them from us, and yet some honorable members would sit idly by and allow him to deprive us of the **British** market.

* We are nowsimply claiming the right to carry on negotiations in relation to the trade of the **British** Empire ; out of those negotiations may spring a policy which will in due course be laid before us.

* If the countries within the **British** Empire imposed duties upon the goods of foreign countries that at present hamper our trade, they would have something to give away when they came to negotiate with those countries.

* Much of the public feeling amongst **British** people against Russia is founded upon the fact that they desire to keep the door open for trade with the East, and they know perfectly well that if Russia puts cn duties against **British** trade, those duties must restrict that trade.

* And so it is with the countries that -impose duties against **British** trade within their own borders.

* Is it not: then, reasonable to suppose that they are equally desirous of securing preferential trade within the whole area of the **British** Empire?

* Well, that policy is entirely opposed to the policy of increasing the hold of **British** manufactures upon the markets of Australia.

* But I want first to take the broad aspect of the policy of **British** preference, and then deal with it in detail.

* If they have safeguarded Australian manufacturers from **British** competition,, then I say the preference is a sham to that extent.

* But if the duties are sufficient to shut out foreign and **British** competition in manufactures, there is nothing in them from a preference point of view.

* If they are insufficient to shut out **British** competition, there is a good deal in them that is hostile to the main principle of this Tariff.

* In what other way can we encourage **British** industry except by) opening  our doors to the manufactures of the Mother Country?

* In 1902, there was a resolution in favour of substantial preference ; and, in April and May of this year, the Imperial Conference, after debate, and in spite of the attitude of the **British** Government, deliberately re-affirmed the substantial preference of 1902.

* Can we be surprised at the attitude of the **British** Government, although our Prime Minister, with his great eloquence and ability, brought all his genius to bear on their position?

* Was there ever anything more, I shall not say ridiculous, but anything more chivalrous in the region of practical politics, than for a practical statesman to go to the people and Ministers of the Mother Country, with the enormous mass of parliamentary support behind them, and expect, by the charm of Australian eloquence, to melt  away  those solid battlements behind which millions of the people stood - to charm away the solemn faith of the **British** Government, and destroy, with a breath, the policy on which, for good or evil, the destinies of the Mother Country solidly rest to-day ?

* Can we be surprised that the **British**" Government had to say " no " ?

* What would our Prime Minister have thought had the **British** Ministry said " yes " ?

* What would have been said if we had had an overwhelming protectionist vote at our elections, affirming the policy of protection, and **British** statesmen had come here, and at a Conference board, thundered with all.

* What would have been said of such **British** Ministers?

* What is the good of protecting and fostering the growth of native industries, if at the same time you are going to admit against them into the market the most dangerous competitor in the whole world - because that is what the **British** manufacturer is?

* That is what the **British** manufacturers are, and it is the sort of talk we would expect from a protectionist.

* He said: - 
You are not going to admit anybody, **British** or foreign, to compete on level terms in your markets in respect of the industries which you desire to protect.

* I will not go into the question whether the **British** manufacturer will remain the most dangerous.

* Listen to the words of General Botha, who was one of the bitterest, although one of the bravest and  straightest,  enemies the **British** race ever had.

* So far -as I can judge it appears to me that the **British** people made their voices and opinion heard on this matter during the last general election in England.

* That erstwhile bitter enemy of England - now one of the Ministers of the **British** 
Crown - manfully says in effect, " Just as we claim the right to regulate our own affairs, so we leave to the Mother Country the same right.

* What would have been the shock of astonishment that would have run  through the **British** Isles if the people had heard then of what was to be done by.

* those who were clamouring for the imposition of taxes on the very bread and meat of struggling millions - under a glorious programme of lightening the burdens of competition and opening the bright gates of Australia to the depressed, 'oppressed, and decaying **British** manufacturers?

* What would have been said if, immediately after the Prime Minister's speech at the Conference, the people of Great Britain had been told that on the main lines of **British** industry the Australian duties, in some cases, were to be doubled?

* If I remember rightly, it was 5 per cent, under the old Tariff, and that duty remains as against **British** imports, whilst those from foreign countries are dutiable at 10 per cent.

* But let us look for a moment at the main lines of **British** export.

* The **British** export of metals, including new ships, are of the value of 40,0001,000, and the exports of machinery are valued at .20,000,000.

* There are 11,000,000 square miles of the earth's surface over which floats the flag of the **British** Isles as a token of supremacy and irresistible power.

* It is the fact that her manufacturers can bring every resource from all countries of the world without a toll or a tax, which constitutes one of the secrets of her marvellous greatness, 
Might I suggest to those who say these 42,000,000 of our English, Scotch, and Irish brethren are a miserable race of starving paupers, that if there are 12,000,000 of starving people in Great Britain, they should, at least, allow the bread of the world to enter freely into **British** ports.

* If you injure the **British** worker in this respect, will you not increase his misery ?

* that whilst the trade of the self-governing dependencies of the Empire, from which this urgent appeal comes, is a very valuable trade, and compared per head is probably the most valuable trade with the Mother 1 Country - I think there is very little doubt about that - still as a matter of actual employment at present, as represented, at any rate, in **British** exports, this is the relationship of the trade of the self-governing dominions to the trade of the Mother Country : The trade of the Mother Country with Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand amounts to 53,000,000 a year.

* The trade with **British** dependencies other than these amounts to 60,000,000 a year.

* The dependencies that are not self-governed take a larger share of **British** exports than do the self-governing dependencies of the Empire.

* Foreign countries take **British** trade to the value of 216,000,000 a year, so.

* that we have 276,000,000 of trade between England and countries that are not self-governing dependencies of the **British** Empire.

* What would have been said by General Botha, who cannot talk much English but who has a sagacious brain, if on the conclusion of the eloquent oration of the Prime Minister of Australia he had been told that the hon- orable gentleman had the intention when he got back to Australia to make the duty on a large line of **British** exports 40 per cent, instead of 15 per cent.?

* If they had been told that the Mother Country was to get 5 per cent, preference out of the additional percentage, what a sensation of disgust would be created amongst; the millions of **British** people.

* Great Britain spends 73,000,000 a year in protecting the **British** Empire, and we are to withdraw our little contribution of 200,000.

* In addition to the vital necessity of free-trade in food products, even to the injury of her own farmers, and in raw material, another consideration stands for a great deal with the **British** people.

* Of course, the **British** fleets have helped to keep other nations quiet ; but these earth-hungry nations have allowed Great Britain to annex territory after territory, because her  policy of an open door gives free entry to them as well as to her own people.

* That wonderful fact is one of the pillars on which the security of the **British** Empire rests.

* I wish now to refer to one or two of the utterances of the Prime Minister at the Conference - 
Preferential trade will enable Australia to secure a large proportion of the **British** trade.

* Preferential trade would enable Australia to secure a large proportion of **British** trade and would enable **British** manufacturers to secure a large proportion of Australian trade.

* Thus we get two stories in this preference proposal, both of which are directed against the free and untaxed supply of food to the **British** people.

* Unless protectionists are prepared to give substantial entry to **British** manufactures into Australia, preferential trade can never 'become a reality, because, when it comes to a matter of payment, pound for pound will be wanted by the people of the Mother Country.

* No man knows better than does the Prime Minister that if  Mr. Chamberlain  - and we all deplore the illness of that distinguished man - had been seated at the table of the Imperial Conference as the head of a Government which had won at the **British** elections upon the question of preference, and if he had said to our Prime Minister, "  Mr. Deakin,  we have all had the pleasure of listening to you before, and we know what a brilliant  speaker  you are.

* Now, I am prepared, under a reciprocal arrangement with you, to impose a tax upon **British** foodstuffs and on raw materials imported into the Mother Country.

* If it meant a genuine, substantial relaxing of the obstacles in the way of **British** competition in Australia, how could the statement be made?

* But if the preference were to be substantial - if it were intended to help great industries, such as the machinery, woollen and apparel industries - great lines of **British** production which are also important lines of Australian manufacture - if it were to injure the infant industries of Australia, it is very questionable whether the Prime Minister could carry his party with him to that extent.

* The **British** people are very generous to their guests, and it would have been well had some of the guests observed the rules of political courtesy.

* I am assured by an authority that a substantial preference to the goods of Great Britain in our markets would result in an increase of **British** trade with Australia to the extent of perhaps 50 per cent.

* The actual value of **British** imports into Australia is 26,000,000.

* Now I wish to quote the view of the **British** Government; in connexion with a system of arranged or reciprocal preference.

* Mr. Lloyd  George says - and says very frankly and ably- - - 
That puts a view which has been put more than once - a view put there very forcibly - of the tangled skein which **British** statesmen have to unwind.

* **British** statesmen have to consider large questions of policy affecting their relations with one or other of the parts of the Empire.

* It is a matter of great consequence to the public - to the , people of the old country and of the Empire - if the attitude which the Prime Minister describes in that statement, which was made a message to **British** merchants, is adhered to, that even the preference in this Tariff is only a beginning - to know to what extent and in what direction other steps are to be taken.

* - The honorable member for Oxley sent Home a statement to the effect that the Immigration Restriction Act excludes, and was intended to exclude, white **British** subjects.

* The honorable member for Corinella endeavoured to satisfy the House that the whole power that could be exercised by the **British** Government in purchasing ships through the Admiralty, was in the direction of defending Great Britain in a time of national danger.

* I wish to get away from the point whether or not we should adopt in this contract the exact language that has been employed by the **British** Government In its contracts, and to point out as shortly as possible the position occupied by the alleged friends of the producers, who sit in Opposition.

* But every officer in the **British** Army is allowed two men - one to act as groom, and the other as a valet.

* He takes those men with him wherever he goes on dutv, and the **British** Government bear his living as well as his travelling expenses while he is so engaged.

* We need to enable any **British** subject who wishes to leave England for Australia to ascertain before he breaks up his home whether he can come here.

* In the same way, the Minister who made this contract was wise enough to limit it to a term of three years, of which it has only two and a half years to run, so that it will terminate contemporaneously with the contract entered into with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company by the **British** Government.

* Those who so confidently find fault with the amount of the subsidy should remember that the foreign companies, whose mail steamers come here, are largely assisted by subsidies, while the **British** boats are looked after by us with a sharpness of eye and a keenness of criticism which amounts almost to the imposition of a handicap upon them in their competition with foreign rivals.

* How was that fall brought about  1  How was it possible for Wolfe to defeat Montcalm, as he did; to make that splendid attack, and to close the same day a victor and a martyr, or, at any rate, a hero  1  It was mainly due to the fact that the superior sea-power of the **British** closed the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the French and opened it to us.

* The French were cut off from their communications, while the **British** communications remained intact.

* The **British** were thus able to attack the French successfully, and from that successful attack came the downfall of French Canada.

* The onus will be cast upon the **British** power of maintaining that route, of maintaining its own communications, and of breaking all others, whether it be to assist Canada or not.

* It is true also that the greater part of the **British** battleships are also massed in those waters.

* The traditional role of the **British** Navy is not to act on the defensive, but to prepare to attack the force which threatens - in other words, to assume the offensive.

* On one occasion England departed from her traditional policy, and acting on the defensive, kept her ships in harbor, unrigged and unmanned - 
Of course it cannot be left out of consideration that the strength and composition, not only of the **British** Navy, but of any **British** squadron, depend upon die strength and position of the hostile forces which they have to meet.

* Whether the Government will prevent the further alienation of Crown lands in **British** New Guinea, so as to secure for all time the future land values of that territory for the people of the Commonwealth ?

* I have had them calculated in regard to mining machinery, the produce of **British** and foreign countries, and also in regard to articles produced in Australia.

* In 1900, the **British** and foreign mining machinery amounted to 169,844 - and see how closely that from Australia comes - while the Australian produce amounted to 152,452.

* The total for the two years was as follows :  - **British** and foreign produce in mining machinery, 266,458 ; Australian ditto, 226,400.

* In 1899, the **British** and foreign produce in parts of machinery brought in amounted to 27,551, while that of Australia amounted to 27,985 ; a total of 55,736.

* In 1900, the **British** and foreign produce in parts of machinery was valued at 61,252; and that of Australia at 49,861, atotal of 111,113.

* The sum of the two years in each case was : **British** and foreign, 89,003 ; Australian, 77,846.

* These figures will show that except so far as Western Australia herself chooses to keep out mining machinery and parts of mining machinery, it is open to her, under this Tariff, to resort to a market which she has found in the past practically as good as the **British**.

* The **British** and foreign un worked timber imported into Western Australia in 1899 amounted to 20,435, and that of Australia to 6,753, making a total of 27,188.

* **British** and foreign timber in balk, rough and hewn, amounted to 2,962, and Australian to 271 only; making a total of 3,233.

* The **British** and foreign unworked timber for that year was 13,970, and the Australian 8,332, making a total of 22,302.

* In balk, for the same year, the figures are : **British** and foreign timber, rough and hewn, 2,547 ; Australian, 461.

* So that the absolute total importations of timber for the two years were as follows :  - **British** andforeign, 39,914; Australian, 15,817; making a total of 55,731.

* be well to refer to the past history of the mail contracts that have been entered into between the various Australian Governments, the **British** Government, and the shipping companies.

* In submitting these tenders, on 7th May, 1886, the **British** Postmaster-General observed - 
An endeavour was made to effect a reduction, and the **British** Postmaster-General was successful in securing a contract on behalf of the various Governments at, I think, ,85,000 a year from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.

* by the late Government show that there was good reason for believing that if the **British** Government had been in a position to negotiate under the old conditions it is possible that it might have been able to bring about a reduction.

* On a former occasion I made a statement in the House to 'the effect that" I thought the **British** Government, in the.

* But  Mr. Anderson  told me that his company had never made any offer to the **British** Government at any time, which would lead them to believe that the company was prepared to renew the contract under the old conditions.

* That was rather a large order for the Commonwealth Government to send to the **British** Government, in connexion with our mail service, arid was not likely to assist to secure a satisfactory offer.

* In reply, a cable was received from the Colonial Office, dated 21st January, 1903, stating that - 
It will be seen, therefore, that, in the opinion of the **British** Postmaster-General, as far back as January, 1903, a renewal of the contract under old conditions might have been secured, with increased speed, for a subsidy of  .85,000  per annum.

* not agree to introduce into a mail contract to which they were a party, stipulations intended to exclude certain classes of **British** subjects from employment in the contract vessels, and unlessthat condition could be modified, the idea of a joint arrangement would have to be abandoned, and other plans made for an Australian service.

* We could not expect that company to help us in the matter by assisting a competing company, although, if we could get our mails from Colombo fo Bombay before the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's boats left, we could compel them to take on the mails under the **British** contract, and by paying Postal Union rates.

* The **British** authorities advised that a contract should be entered into for only three years, and it was one of the objections to  Mr. Scott  Fell's tender that he asked for a contract for ten years.

* The **British** authorities, in dealing with the matter, directed attention to the construction of the Siberian railway, and, amongst other considerations, to the improvements made in the construction of steam-ships.

* The **British** Government had entered into a contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company to carry mails to and f rom Australia, and the Commonwealth" Government took advantage of the service for the return mails at a cost of 15,000 per annum.

* But the **British** Government fully expected that if they paid 85.000 subsidy for a service to Australia, and the Commonwealth Government took advantage of that service, we would, at least, be prepared to give a like efficient service from this end.

* As a matter of fact, the **British** mails were more disarranged than were the Australian mails, because, unlike the **British** Government, we had the Orient and several other boats to make use of.

* But, seeing that the **British** Government, under their contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, insist that such articles shall be carried under the  subsidy,  we claimed to be afforded the same facilities.

* The agreements which have been made by the **British** Government with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and formerly with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, have all been subject to the approval of the Imperial Parliament.

* The **British** Government succeeded in getting a much faster service from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.

* The **British** Government arranged with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, under old conditions, which our law would not permit us to do, for an acceleration of twenty-four hours on the old contract speed, and, in.

* The poundage system was not satisfactory, and to have continued it would have been to commit what would have been practically a breach of an understanding with the **British** Government.

* The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, under contract with the **British** Government, were giving a service nearly sixty hours quicker than that of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and we had the right to send our mails to London by their steamers on the understanding that we would provide a similar service from this end.

* The mails from England were more disarranged by the poundage system than ours were, because, whereas the Commonwealth Government had power to place its mails on the vessels of the Orient Steam Navigation Company and other outgoing steamers, the **British** Government could not require the Orient Steam Navigation Company to take on board mails at a foreign port, and nothing, of course, would have been gained by putting mails on board their steamers at London.

* My opinion is that, in consideration of the protection which is accorded by the **British** Navy - towards the cost of maintaining which we make a small contribution - all **British** ships should be required to carry  His  Majesty's mails to or from any ports of call, provided, of course, that they are fairly paid.

* per lb., and it seems to me that the same right should be insisted upon in regard to all **British** ships which enjoy the protection of the **British** flag.

* No class of trade receives so much protection as does the shipping trade, and one of the advantages ship-owners derive owing to the adequacy of the safeguards provided by the **British** Navy takes the form of reduced insurance rates.

* When the **British** Government approached us with the offer that it was prepared to give penny postage on letters posted in Great Britain, provided we allowed-, letters to go from Australia at the local rate, we at once adopted that course.

* But when the postal revenue increases, as I am glad to say it is doing, I trust we shall be able to respond to the request of the **British** Government, and so take an important step towards the establishment of a penny Empire rate.

* Furthermore, we considered that we owed an obligation to the **British** Government to make arrangements for continuing the service.

* existed for years in **British** New Guinea, but the extent of settlement which has taken place amounts almost to nothing.

* At the same time, as there are so many aboriginals in **British** New Guinea, we ought to prohibit any liquor whatever being sold for the present except through a Government store.

* Any ordinance authorizing the purchase of land by private persons, except from the Lieutenant-Governor, or from purchasers from him or from the Administrator of the Possession of **British** New Guinea.

* The **British** North America Act of 1867 gave the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada, in relation to matters not exclusively assigned to the provinces.

* Last of all, the **British** -Australian Tobacco Manufacturing Company, which had been formed to fight the foreign companies, appointed Kronheimer Limited sole distributor of their manufactures in Australia.

* mated with all the leading **British** firms, the predominant **British** partners being W. D. Wills and H. O. Wills, Ltd.

* Some time after the American and **British** giants had come to terms, the tentacles in Australia had kept up the battle.

* For the purpose of illustrating the relationship which exists between the **British** American tobacco combine, and the monopoly which controls the trade in Australia, I have taken the trouble to obtain from the Melbourne Share Register, a list of the large shareholders in the companies carrying on operations here.

* He declared that the following firms had entered into an arrangement : - 
The **British**-Australasian Tobacco Co. Limited, Melbourne and Sydney ; W. D. and H. O. Wills (Australia), Limited, Sydney ; the States Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, Melbourne; the American Tobacco of Australasia Limited, Sydney; Cameron Bros, and Company Limited, Brisbane ; the **British** American Tobacco Company Limited, London, which company includes the Australian business of Williams and Dunlop.

* Do the shareholders of the States Tobacco Company, apart from yourself and your brothers, hold the shares  bond fide  or in trust for the **British** Australasian Company?

* The **British** Australasian Tobacco Company pay the girl employes in their Melbourne factory 15s.

* I should like, now, to put before the Committee a comparison of the hands employed in the factories of the **British** Australasian Tobacco Company in Melbourne and Sydney, as well as the Melbourne cigar factory of the States Tobacco Company during the last three years.

* The contractor shall not give or agree to give any undue preference to any company or person outside the **British** Dominions in relation to the conveyance of or rates to be charged for persons or goods by any mail ships employed under the contract as compared with persons resident within the **British** Dominions.

* Goods imported from Germany and Belgium are often bought by the **British** agents of Australian firms.

* All that this clause provides is that the contractor shall not give, or agree to give, undue preference to a company or person outside the **British** Dominions.

* As a rule, such preferences are given to persons, not outside, but within the **British** Dominions in respect of goods purchased abroad, and that practice can still be carried on under these conditions.

* He expects to receive 62 from this duty in Western Australia, evidently assuming that **British** and foreign produce will cease to be imported, and that the requirements of Western Australia will be met by supplies from the eastern States.

* of bacon of **British** and foreign produce, as against 2,800,000 lbs.

* Last year the hams of **British** and foreign produce imported into Western Australia totalled 130,817 lbs., as against 378,593 lbs.

* As to the comparative advantages of a Select Committee and a Cabinet Committee for the purposes of inquiring into the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, there can be no question, though the Postmaster-General declared the other night that a member of the **British** Parliament once stated that a Committee could not investigate the affairs of so intricate a Department.

* The statement of the Postmaster-General was opposed to the practice of a number of **British** Governments, which have from time to time agreed to the appointment of Committees to investigate postal administration.

* In 1903, a Committee of private individuals was appointed by  Mr. Austen  Chamberlain to investigate the conduct of affairs by those in charge of the **British** Post Office.

* The report of the last-named Committee induced the **British** Postmaster-General to accept its unanimous recommendations, although they involved an additional expenditure of something like 1,000,000.

* The objects I have in view are very similar to those which the **British** PostmasterGeneral sought to attain, as will be seen from the following subjects of inquiry by the **British** Select Committee - 
I am sure that any one who has seen the report of that Select Committee would welcome similar results in the case of the Commonwealth Post and Telegraph service.

* It would be better to quote the **British** PostmasterGeneral on the point.

* Speaking at Southampton,  Mr. Sydney  Buxton said - 
The **British** Postmaster-General, it will be seen, did not propose to appoint any Cabinet Committee, but to move for the creation of one of the highest tribunals, namely, a Select Committee.

* The **British** Postmaster-General vent on to say - 
I admit that, too.

* I may say that, so far as I know, a charge of this kind is made in no other **British** Possession.

* One of the main branches of inquiry by the **British** Select Committee was as to 'sanitation and ventilation, and the opinion was strongly expressed that the Government had the duty, not only of paying the public servants, but of seeing that they enjoyed healthy conditions in their work. "

* With that object in view, I think that we might levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon netting of foreign manufacture and of 5 per cent, upon netting of **British** origin.

* I think that the Government would  be acting wisely if they agreed to levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture and 5 per cent, upon netting of **British** origin.

* A duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture, and of 5 per cent, upon netting of **British** origin, over and above the cost of the raw material, would, I think, represent a fair compromise.

* That would leave our manufacturers a clear protection of 10 per cent, in the case of wire-netting of foreign manufacture, and of 5 per cent, in the case of netting of **British** origin.

* Whether we can attract a sufficient number of **British** immigrants for this purpose is a matter upon which very few of us are able to express  an authoritative opinion.

* But if we cannot attract sufficient **British** immigrants, rather than turn to the southern countries of Europe to supply us with the necessary population, we should turn our eyes to the north, and endeavour to induce  people  of the Scandinavian races to settle here.

* With regard to the New Hebrides, I should like to know if anything further has been done to secure the appointment of a **British** Judge in the group.

* Some time ago the Prime Minister stated in answer to a question that he had made representations to the **British** Government as to the necessity of such an appointment, and that he had also drawn their attention to the fact that a French Judge was already there.

* I regard with increasing anxiety the position of **British** settlers in the New Hebrides.

* I can seeclearly that conditionsare making for the ultimate annexation of that group of islands by the French, in the absence of constant watchfulness on the part of Australia, and unless repeated representations are made to the **British** Government as to their strategical importance from the point of view of defence.

* The consequence was thatthese people, who left Australia with the laudable intention of  providing another safeguard for the interests of Australia in time of need - of securing an effective occupation which would, perhaps, have enabled the **British** to set up a good claim for the annexation of the islands and their magnificent harbors - which are the most suitable for naval -operations in the islands of the Pacific - found themselves stranded.

* While on this subject, I should like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to some negotiations on the part of two foreign powers to secure two islands in the Pacific having good ports, and at present under **British** jurisdiction.

* Will the Prime Minister take steps to warn the **British** Government of the danger of parting with those islands?

* Once they pass from **British** control, there will be absolutely no point, apart from Fiji, where the **British** will be able to establish an adequate naval station along the* whole of the thousands of miles of ocean route between Panama and Australia, and our commerce will thusbewholly exposed to an enemy's ships of war, if that enemy has naval bases in the Pacific and we have none.

* No direction is sought to be given to any one to transmit the resolution of the House to any person, nor would any person be authorized to transmit it to any Government, **British** or otherwise.

* If the two Houses of this Parliament, elected on the broadest possible franchise in the **British** Dominions should, immediately after the elections, pass a resolution on this subject- 
If I were to say that it was debated during the elections, it would be misleading, but it is not misleading to say that the question is being dealt with immediately after a new House has assembled, and that the action of the Transvaal Council, indorsed by the Imperial Government, is one which no considerable body in Australia can indorse in any way.

* The honorable member for Richmond used a very able argument, with which I would quite agree if we were attempting to dictate to the Imperial Government, or to the Government of any **British** possession.

* I doubt whether the best way to appeal to the **British** public is through the medium of the Cabinet.

* The objection of the honorable member for Werriwa ought to disappear when he finds that the motion is not a peremptory direction from this House to the **British** Government to give further consideration to the Ordinance.

* painful experience, and we are bound, at every possible opportunity, to give public expression to our view - which may be useful to **British** people in other parts of the world - that their action, however conscientious and well-meant, cannot have the good effect which they desire, but will be inimical to themselves and to the best interests of the **British** race.

* The destruction of the native race is surely sufficient to induce conscientious **British** people to intervene, without attempting to firing from another country a class of labourers who are to be penned in and hemmed in, in a worse manner, by means of regulations and enactments, than was done by any Act that was ever passed for controlling the slaves in the United States of America.

* -Can we, as **British** people, justify a policy like that?

* Are we not just as much entitled to make a protest against anything of that kind as  against real slavery in any part of the **British** Empire?

* we who have entered into the Imperial bond, and* who are proud of our freedom-loving **British** institutions, must take an active interest.

* There is no nation in the world that has a greater claim to credit for the emancipation of the slaves than the **British**.

* Yet this treatment is to be permitted to be meted out to the Chinese for the purpose  of making a few paltry pounds of profit, not for the benefit of the people who are on the verge of destitution in Great Britain - not for those ten millions in the **British** Isles who cannot tell whether they will have a decent meal to eat the day after to-morrow - but to increase the wealth and the power and the profit of those who are already' living in luxury.

* The object of this policy is to increase the wealth of people who are wealthy enough already, and who have enough power in Great Britain already - people who have by their acts and their influence on **British** policy during the past ten years done more to damage the prestige of the **British** Empire than have those other people who have been charged with that conduct.

* But it will have weight whether it is sent to the **British** Government or not.

* It is a reflection on ourselves that the more enlightened **British** Government, which suppressed what I have heard described as a horde of ignorant Boers, should in one of their first acts have done something which the Boers have never even been charged with doing.

* The **British** Government in 1884 took a very strong, dignified, and proper stand in stopping the recruiting of kanakas where it was found that the abuses were of such a -character that no **British** Government ought to allow them to continue.

* This should serve as a warning to the democracy of Australia that they should not rest too secure in the seeming unanimity of the people upon a matter of this kind, but should always be prepared to resist to the uttermost any attempt to inaugurate a policy that would be humiliating to the democracy of Australia, and injurious to any part of the **British** Empire.

* It is there admitted that, although the mills are running full time and trade is booming, probably no profits are being made ; the surplus stock is sent to Australia and Canada, to the advantage of the **British** manufacturers, but to the injury of the manufacturers here.

* A fixed duty would stop the swamping of the trade at the end of the **British** season, and before the season here has started.

* When he saw that such a proposition was likely to revive the feline which prevailed when the **British** corn laws were in operation, he promptly abandoned it.

* I indorse the view of ihe Duke of Devonshire, who, in addressing the **British** Empire League, said that the best way to bring about closer union between Great Britain and her Colonies is to leave the Colonies free to manage their own finances.

* The Prime Minister frequently advocated Federation on the ground that it would lead to the abolition of State duties, and I should like to know why he is not prepared to apply the same principle to the **British** Empire?

* He is  president,  not of the **British** Empire League, because I have that honour, but of an Empire League in Victoria.

* That principle cannot be extended to the whole world at present, but it could be brought into operation so far as the **British** Empire is concerned.

* Instead of dealing with the 800.000 people of New Zealand, whom we are now attempting to placate, we should then Le dealing with 50,000,000 of **British** people.

* 4-  Is the Government prepared to take any action towards securing .1 Government-owned cable across the Atlantic, between Canada and the **British** Isles (thus completing an all-red cable route from Australia), with a view to so reducing the cost of communication that freer intercourse may foster our commerce, our knowledge of each other, and probably immigration, to our mutual advantage?

* For instance, the English Naturalization Act of 1870 makes provision for the renunciation of nationality by foreigners who become naturalized under it, and similarprovision foi* the renunciation of **British** nationality by **British** persons who becomenaturalized abroad.

* Although it is not expressly declared to be applicable, the wordsused in it are " **British** Dominions."

* If the principle of freedom of commercial interchange be a good one, as we believe it is, we must welcome with the most cordial satisfaction anything which seems to tend to a more clear appreciation of the value of commercial freedom - everything which seems to give that boon more and more freely to the people of the **British** Empire.

* I cannot conceive of anything more unjustifiable on the part of the selfgoverning parts of the Empire, which have deliberately adopted a policy hostile to the policy of the mother country, than is any encouragement of hope in the breasts of the **British** people that the people of Australia are prepared to receive the products of their industries more freely than before, if there be no real intention to carry out that policy, when we come to consider the terms of a specific agreement.

* No one can respond more heartily than I do to the fervent appeal made by my honorable and learned friend to the spirit of brotherhood which happily prevails within the limits of the **British** Empire.

* I claim to be as anxious to promote the welfare and the best interests of the **British** Empire as is my honorable and learned friend.

* I believe that those who are not able to look as affectionately as he can do upon this proposed new departure are just as loyal, and are just as prepared to stand by the obligations which membership of the **British** Empire entails, as is any honorable member who is the most ardent believer in  Mr. Chamberlain.

* But the best consideration that I have been able to give to this matter shows me, first of all, that there are innumerable difficulties to be overcome before the policy can be adopted ; and, secondly, that it is a matter of the gravest doubt whether such a policy would conduce to the stability or the prosperity of the **British** Empire.

* view, the motive and the ruling power in this policy is the desire to bring these self-governing States into the intimate responsibilities of the **British** Empire.

* We must begin by remembering that the stability of the **British** Empire was never greater than it is to-day, that its cohesion was never more firm than it is to-day, and that a grave responsibility rests upon those who wish to contract that freedom.

* When honorable members become impatient at the earnest appeals which are sent across the seas by the representatives of the masses of the **British** workers of to-day, they forget, perhaps, how different is the history of the masses in England from that of the masses in favoured lands like these.

* And when this call comes across the seas from the workers of England to the workers of Australia, let us remember that even the **British** Premier himself describes the horror of the taxation of food as a thing which has been burnt into the breast of labour by centuries of misery and starvation.

* Then, when I say that all the members of the **British** Parliament who can be said to form the Labour Party, have unanimously represented the feeling of the workers of the mother country as being adverse to anything that would involve the taxation of food-- 
London, massive powers which represent everything but the people - we see these crouching behind  Mr. Chamberlain.

* I put these considerations only in order to show that the matter is not an easy one to decide, and that it is easy to understand the hesitancy of the **British** people under the circumstances of their history.

* Great as  Mr. Chamberlain  was, and deservedly is - he is a man for whom I personally have a high admiration - commanding as was his influence in the Cabinet of the nation, when he presented to that Cabinet a proposal to tax the food of the **British** people, even he had to retire from the Government.

* In writing to  Mr. Chamberlain,  in September of last year, with regard to his resignation from the Cabinet, he said, in one paragraph relating to the subject of the taxation of food - 
Now, as Ave know, a system of preferential trade which does not include **British** taxes upon food is not one that can commend itself to the Australian Colonies.

* Later on, in the House of Commons, upon the 18th of May of this year,  Mr. Balfour  said - and honorable members must understand that at present I am referring only to this one topic - 
Here we find the Prime Minister of England - who refused to adopt  Mr. Chamberlain's  policy of colonial preference, and who had to accept  Mr. Chamberlain's  resignation because he declined to adopt it - day after day, and month after month, asserting the fixed attitude of the Government and of the **British** people with reference to that class of taxation.

* That is a thorough protectionist policy, which has nothing to do with the stability of the **British** Empire, although it has a great deal to do with the increased advantage which is given to the colonial manufacturer.

* That paragraph states - 
The Prime Minister be invited to obtain all data necessary for the preparation of a measure granting a preference to **British** imports into Australia which compete solely with imports from foreign countries.

* If my protectionist friends will abandon that theory, and declare their willingness to stamp out those industries for the benefit of **British** manufacturers, I should like to hear them say so.

* The great industries of the future will have only small beginnings, and one of the difficulties of my honorable friends is that they must either decree the extinction of the small, struggling manufacturing industries of Australia, or they must refrain from giving ' a substantial entrance for **British** manufactures into Australia.

* The **British** Empire has sixty countries within its bounds.

* During the financial year 1903-4, the total amount contributed by the **British** taxpayer to naval and military expenditure was ^69,000,000.

* Some people talk of this ,200,000 that we give to the **British** Navy as a magnificent display of Australian generosity.

* I say that we are bound to look our responsibilities to the **British** Empire more squarely in the face.

* But, looking at the armed nations as they stand to-day, looking at the policy which we have honestly and fairly adopted, we must not forget that there is only one thing in these beginnings of ours which stands  between  us and invasion, and that is the **British** flag.

* .The question is more with my protectionist friends than with me: Will they, listening to this wail of **British** industries, that they are debarred by our policy from entering Australian markets, open those markets to **British** manufacturers?

* in the most violent language, which seemed almost to evince a spirit of satisfaction, that **British** agriculture is in its last extremities.

* I ask, will the protectionists of Australia send the message across the seas, " If you will give us an advantage for our great producing industries, we will open our markets to your great **British** manufactures " ?

* Our industries may be small, but they cover pretty well the  whole area of **British** manufactures.

* There might be something substantial in this vision of Imperial unity, if you could bring, about some such grand conception as free-trade within the **British** Empire.

* We have 400,000,000 people under the supremacy of the **British** Crown, 380,000,000 of whom are to-day under a practically free-trade policy, while only 20,000,000 are under protective laws.

* But out of 400,000,000 only 20,000,000 **British** subjects live under protective laws.

* It seems to go quite against the grain of the picture that is so often presented to us - that in the absence of preference to the mother country, **British** trade is going to the dogs.

* If there is any law which imperils the conveyance of food to England in time of war, it would apply to colonial food sent in **British** ships, just as much as it would apply to American food sent to Great Britain in other vessels.

* Let me mention another aspect of this question, which to my mind shows a want of candour, and appeals to the meanest feelings of the **British** people.

* The difference in trade between the United States and Great Britain is a difference between about ^130,000,000 worth of American produce purchased by Englishmen, and ^30,000,000 of **British** produce sent across the seas to America.

* Is it not a wonder that there is not sufficient candour on the part of the advocates of this policy to induce them to point to the United States as the arch-example of danger to **British** commerce?

* I do not say that she does not richly deserve to be punished; but in the management of that complicated marvel, the **British** Empire, the **British** Government have anxieties enough, and dangers enough ahead of them without cutting into the financial susceptibilities of the great American people.

* Of that trade the United Kingdom has 40,000,000 worth, and **British** Possessions have 20,000,000 worth.
