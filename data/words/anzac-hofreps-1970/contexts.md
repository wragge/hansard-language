## Contexts in which the word "anzac" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* We saw the recogtion of Hanoi and the invitation by the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and a few of his friends to representatives of the Vietcong to come to Australia as their guests, arriving here about Anzac Day.

* One result of the departure of the British from this part of the world should be to make us realise our greater degree of defence nakedness, and should help to draw the two Anzac nations closer together.

* Honourable members will remember that a few years ago if a soldier marched on Anzac Day with a Communist alongside him the Liberals would designate him a Communist.

* It is an impossible situation when we consider that people in the industry have only Thursday and Friday- which is Anzac Day- of this week and Monday and Tuesday of next week to prepare a case.

* I spelt out a rather frightening example that there could be a Temporary Assistance Authority reference yesterday and an expectation that a reasonable case could be presented on Tuesday with Anzac Day intervening.

* This provision, of course, covers familiar Anzac Day practice.

* On the Saturday that we arrived back at the airport in Brisbane, returning from the Anzac Day services the previous week, about 100 people came out of the aircraft and lined up for customs clearance.

* One only has to attend an Anzac Day commemoration each year.

* The Task Force included artillery and infantry sub-units from the New Zealand Army which, in the ANZAC tradition, served with distinction with the Australian forces.

* When this date was passed, and the Treasurer was about to go to the Philippines on about Anzac Day the industry in some concern sent a paper to the Prime Minister and requested an interview.

* It is thus fittingly the scene of the national Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies.

* 1 might say that, in collaboration with my colleague the Minister for the Army I am looking at the possibility of the holding of some nationwide marches on Anzac Day to enable the people of Australia to pay a tribute  10  the fine spirit of everything that was done by the Australians in Vietnam.

* He made another visit to Australia later on in 1965 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Anzac.

* I went to a public meetingit was the first time that I had been involved in anything political-at the Anzac Hall in Sydney.

* One of my constituents,  Mr Kupke  of Anzac Parade.

* The functions themselves - and I speak now from memoryare the arrival of  Her  Majesty the Queen in Canberra, the opening of the Captain Cook memorial, the reception to be given by the Australian Government in Parliament House on the evening of  Her  Majesty's arrival, the Anzac Day ceremonies, the presentation of new Queen's Colours at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, on the morning of Monday, 27th April, the garden party at Government House that afternoon, and the Royal party's departure from Fairbairn on the morning of Tuesday, 28th- April.

* I can think of only one, and that takes place every Anzac Day.

* Being a matter of significance at that time, he spoke of Anzac Day, not only of its importance but also of the things for which it stands.

* At recent Anzac reunions the shock and sense of loss were felt deeply by all present.

* That was bad enough, but as a returned serviceman and a member of the Returned Services League I was particularly revolted to read in the Press last week a report that the Vietnam Moratorium Committee intends to use the traditional red poppy of Anzac on a macabre coffin draped with a North Vietnamese and a Vietcong flag in the march in Melbourne on 18th September.

* I would like the honourable gentleman and the House to know that the crews of the 'Perth', the Anzac' and the 'Yarra' resent intensely any suggestion that they walked off.

* The new concession will come into operation on 1st April 1970 but will not be available for pensioners commencing travel over the Anzac Day weeknend 
I accept the Minister's assurance that that will not be interfered with in any way.

* My criticism of the withholding of the concession on public holidays applies also to the Anzac Day week-end.

* There is only Anzac Day, which we celebrate in 2 days time.

* I know that the word ANZAC means the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.

* He said that  Mr A.  I. Allan, who is well known to many members who have been in this House for as long as I and who was a former member for Gwydir, was appointed Secretary-General and Director of the Anzac Agency, Commonwealth War Graves Commission, on 1 May 1969 to the age of 65 at a salary of $9,598 a year.

* For example, in the debate on the Appropriation Bills earlier this week we had successive speakers ranging over topics as far apart from each other and from any scrutiny of expenditure as cigarette advertising, the East Pakistan cyclone, Anzac Day, gold mining subsidies and the Trade Practices Act.

* He represented his family at the fiftieth anniversary of Anzac.

* Sir Walter  epitomised the best of the Anzac generation.

* They are to advance the causes of the servicemen of Australia, to challenge all those eccentricities in the repatriation system which need amendment and to try to make Anzac Day and the Australian flag mean something in the Australian context in modern times and not turn them into the figures of fun as they have done with so many young people of today.

* In addition there is also the prospect, as we have on this occasion, of holidays intervening - Easter and Anzac Day - and the distances of travel from far parts of Australia.

* Was the omission, during the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcast of the Anzac Day parade in Sydney on 25 April 1977, to name clearly the group of men and women representing Australian soldiers, who were isolated and cared for by Timorese citizens in World War II an accidental omission or a result of a direction to comply with the present Government 's decision to ignore the Timorese.

* The honourable member will be aware that the Papua New Guinea Government has indicated that henceforth Anzac Day will not be recorded as an official holiday in Papua New Guinea.

* Will the right honourable gentleman cooperate in giving the greatest possible publicity to the fact that gatherings and marches which commemorate high principles do not attract violence, as illustrated all over Australia by Anzac Day marches and gatherings this week?

* I stood at dawn one Anzac morning at Alatau at Milne Bay where the first Australian soldier was shot in that area by the Japanese.

* No separate departmental facilities are provided in Brisbane for long term chronically ill patients other than the Anzac Annexe of Rosemount Repatriation Hospital.

* I wish we could divert people's attention on both Anzac Day and Remembrance Day to consider what they are about - gratitude for peace on Remembrance Day and on Anzac Day, remembrance of the sacrifice and folly of war and the loyalty that produced the kinds of things that happened.

* Indeed,  Mr Speaker,  I understand that he used to ride a horse in his Light Horse uniform in Anzac Day marches as a returned soldier of the First World War and then return by car to march as a returned soldier of the Second World War.

* So, without any notes or preparation, I shall speak on a subject which I had not intended to discuss - Anzac Day.

* Today is 23rd April and Anzac Day is 25th April.

* I often wonder whether many Australians nowadays regard Anzac Day as an occasion for a holiday rather than as a holiday for a great occasion.

* I do not believe that Anzac Day should be made the occasion for a holiday.

* If Anzac Day falls on a day other than a Sunday there is a holiday but it should be regarded as a holiday for a great occasion.

* I was extremely disappointed when the Returned Services League, to some extent, and the people of Australia decided that Anzac Day should be commemorated on the appropriate day, 25th April, and agreed to the holding of sports meetings in the afternoon of that day.

* Many people who go to the Anzac Day services and celebrations in the morning of Anzac Day constantly watch the time to ensure that they can get away to some sporting event.

* We would not be in peaceful occupation of Australia, nor would I have the opportunity of speaking in this Parliament at the present time had it not been for the sacrifice of the men to whom we pay homage on Anzac Day.

* I think I should say something about Anzac Day.

* It was mentioned to me by members of the Defence forces that while the living away from home capital cities allowances for public servants were adjusted early in January of this year, similar adjustments had not been made for members of the armed services as late as Anzac Day.

* I think it was a little unfair of the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett)  to imply that the sittings of the House were arranged as a mark of disrespect to Anzac Day.

* We had to decide whether the House should sit in the week after Easter or in the week in which Anzac Day falls.

* It is most unfair to say that there was any intention to show disrespect to Anzac Day.

* Quite frankly Anzac Day is just as important to honourable members on this side of the House as it is to honourable members on the other side of the House.

* We all know what Anzac Day symbolises.

* It does us no credit when we go around on Anzac Day and we hear of Timorese who said that they stuck by us in World War II when we have not stuck by them in 1 978.

* Do the streets of Melbourne belong to the returned soldiers only on Anzac Day?

* As I said in the Anzac Day oration, this visit is a disgrace to Australia.

* 1 ) The table below shows briefly the accident history of the intersection of Anzac Parade and Blamey Crescent from 1 966 to 22 September 1974.

* I would say that they are Australia Day, Anzac Day and Remembrance Day.

* It is true that if our fighting forces had not taken part in events on foreign soil to protect this country which led to the observance of Anzac Day there would not be a Remembrance Day and certainly there would no longer be an Australia Day.

* I am speaking on this matter tonight because when this Parliament resumes sitting next Wednesday, Anzac Day this year will have passed.

* As Anzac Day is only a few days off, I say very definitely that the people should rally to the marches and meetings of Anzac Day so as to instil into the younger generation those things that mattered so much to Australia during the 2 World Wars and since then during what, compared with the 2 World Wars, may be described as minor conflicts.

* Of course, next week the Anzac Day march will take place.

* But we must remember when Anzac Day comes that it is the right time to put forward our feeling.

* So we must be enthusiastic about Anzac Day, Australia Day and Remembrance Day.

* Australians should always treat Australia Day, Anzac Day and Remembrance Day with reverence because they are the days that signify the very principles on which this nation has been built.

* Anzac Day, as we know, falls on the 25th of this month.

* That this House considers that in the interests of the nation Australia Day shall as from 1978, be celebrated on Anzac Day of the same year, and that a private members' Bill be introduced to enable this to take place.

* Monday next, 25 April, Australia will celebrate Anzac Day.

* In the five minutes I have in this adjournment debate I would like to try and put into words some of the things which make Anzac Day so special for the true Australian.

* I invite the critics of Anzac Day to go along to the ceremonies which will be conduced on Monday as I know that they will not witness a war spirit, a love of war or a celebration of killing.

* We are all aware that the tradition or spirit of Anzac was born on that catastrophic day 62 years ago when thousands of young Australians joined New Zealanders and Englishmen to take part in the abortive landings on Gallipoli.

* Since that first awful day in 1915, more than 120 000 Australians have given their lives in many parts of the world for the same cause and in so doing they have perpetuated the spirit of Anzac.

* Above all let us cherish the spirit and he tradition of Anzac, and then perhaps in some way, by remembering them and their deeds, we can say, they did not die in vain.

* This is a clear indication that while the Government can find plenty of money for other things, when it comes to a soldier settler or even an old Anzac no money is available.

* However, because this day is being observed in some States , as an Anzac Day holiday the House will not sit on that day, but will sit again on Tuesday, 27th April.

* And if all sides keep their cool - the moratorium marchers will do no more barm than the Anzac marchers did on April 23.

* Is it a fact that the 20th anniversary  of  Anzac in 1935 and the 30th anniversary of the first Tasman flight in 1958 were two issues which breached this rule.

* With reference to the Anzac Day service traditionally held at the Concord Repatriation Hospital, for how many years have services been held.

* Sweden, France, and even our Anzac partner, New Zealand.

* Had it been Anzac Day it would have been at least 150,000, but seeing that it was the Moratorium in Melbourne it was 70,000.

* Anzac Agency, Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

* What improvements are needed to bring Service housing in the Moorebank, Holsworthy and Anzac Village areas up to a desirable standard.

* In addition he will be attending an Anzac Day ceremony for the first time in history as far as I know in my electorate.

* The school cadet band is part of the Anzac Day march and services each year.

* They provide the catafalque guard at the Cathedral each ANZAC day morning.

* National symbols such as Anzac Day have been the subject of derision.

* It plans to set up an Anzac Olympic foundation to provide for the general promotion of the national fitness of the total population and also to provide scholarships for athletes and coaches to undertake overseas tours.

* If we can perpetuate the spirit of Anzac by encouraging national unity and pride in our physical fitness and international sporting achievements, we will have taken a giant step towards providing for its future.

* The answer is a small Anzac annexe at Rosemount Repatriation Hospital that contains about 25 beds at the most.

* They are in favour of it just like the national anthem, motherhood, Anzac Day and the Returned Services League.

* By many of the public pronouncements of its leadership, the RSL has caused the younger generation in Australia to be inclined to pay scant respect to such events as Anzac Day and all that it stands for.

* I am involved in the community in such a way that often I am the recipient of criticism from younger people for my continued membership of the RSL and my participation in such events as Anzac Day because somehow some of the remarks of the people who lead the RSL have made the celebration of that day appear irrelevant.

* Bureau of Mineral Resources Library- The BMR Library is located in the BMR Building (Anzac Park East Building), corner of Anzac Parade and Constitution Avenue, Parkes, Australian Capital Territory, and has branches in the BMR office, Darwin; and the BMR Geophysical Observatory at Mundaring, Western Australia.

* It has been decided that the second training ship, HMAS Anzac', can be paid off when HMAS Duchess' completes her conversion refit in 1974.

* It appeared in the Canberra Times' on 26th April, the day after Anzac Day.

* Anzac Day 1971.

* It reads: 
The Reverend J. R. Payne said at the dawn service at the War Memorial yesterday that many young people should remember that their freedom to express their opinions had been bought with the lives of those being remembered on Anzac Day.

* Parents should teach their children and instil into them the traditions of Anzac and the other sacrifices that have been made in the 2 great world wars and the other minor conflicts.

* The Anzac tradition, particularly as it relates to Gallipoli and the achievements of our fighting forces, not only in Gallipoli but also elsewhere and at other times, is important for most Australians, even the younger generation.

* The word Anzac' is also a special word for New Zealand.

* Recently I had the honour of representing this Parliament and laying a wreath at an Anzac Day ceremony in a New Guinea town.

* It is not so long now before we will be marching down the streets on Anzac Day to remember the 60,000 people who died in the two World Wars.

* If it is good enough for the men of commerce to use the streets for their purposes, for the newspapers to sell their wares, for the farmers to march down, and for the people of Australia to stand still on them or march down them on the two historic days of each year, Armistice Day and Anzac Day, it is good enough at some time for private people, calling on the conscience of the nation, to demand the same right.

* I claim to have some knowledge of New Guinea, having served there during the war and having been back on a number of occasions, including 3 visits as a representative of the Government at Anzac Day services.

* One thing that really shocked me when I went up to New Guinea last Anzac Day was the bitter criticism of the statement of the Leader of the Opposition.

* It is true that the honourable member met people when he was in New Guinea last Anzac Day, as I was, who praised the administration.

* Firstly 1 want to thank the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  for the great courtesy he has shown - this is the praiseworthy side of my comments - and his officers for the courtesy extended to me whilst in New Guinea last Anzac Day.

* I went back to a copy of the  Northern Daily Leader  of Anzac Day, this year or last year- it does not give the year.

* I can spare only a couple of quotations from the series of events which accompanied the return of Currabubula 's most famous son on Anzac evelast year or this year?

* Honourable members who have attended Anzac Day marches will know how proudly so many wives, widows, mothers and children of servicemen wear their decorations.

* Perhaps I should say, with relevance to the previous discussion, that I have been attending Anzac Day ceremonies in my electorate for 32 years and there does not seem to be any dispute about it.

* Service housing in the Moorebank, Holsworthy and Anzac Village areas has been provided by the New South Wales Housing Commission under Commonwealth/State Housing Agreements and directly by Commonwealth purchase or construction.

* In respect of the Moorebank, Holsworthy and Anzac Village areas the total Army housing stock is 2040 dwellings of which 1430 were obtained under CSHA arrangements and 6 10 by direct Commonwealth provision.

* -My purpose in speaking this evening is to seek the support of all members of this House, the media and the community at large not only to have 26 January designated as Australia Day, our national day, but also to have 26 January and only 26 January as the public holiday for Australia Day in the same manner as has always applied to the observance of Anzac Day.

* The ABC found no mention of the group in its research, conducted in collaboration with the organisers, prior to the Anzac Day Parade, nor was such a group officially identified in the Parade itself.

* As a preface I state that it is a well established practice for senators and members of the Commonwealth and State parliaments to attend Anzac Day commemoration services throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth.

* Victoria - Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg; Macleod Repatriation Hospital, Mont Park; Anzac Hostel, 'Brighton.

* No separate Departmental facilities are provided for long term chronically ill patients other than the Anzac Annexe at Rosemount Repatriation Hospital in Brisbane, the Anzac Hostel in Melbourne and the Repatriation Ward at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, Picton, New South Wales.

* A Morgan gallup poll conducted during the Anzac Day weekend disclosed that 75 per cent of the respondents supported the freeze.

* We have not said the last thing about Anzac when we say that the soldiers were gallant.

* 1 want  to  say briefly that I had the opportunuity while in New Guinea with the delegation on Anzac Day of attending a meeting of the Select Committee at one of the points where  it  took evidence in the Gazelle Peninsula.

* Before the suspension of the sitting 1 was pointing out that 1 had made several visits to Papua and New Guinea in recent months and that as leader of a delegation last Anzac Day I was able to listen for a time to evidence that was given to the Select Committee on Constituti onal Reform.

* During last year the Government sounded out the prospect of altering the form of observance for Anzac Day.

* In addition to those to which I have referred, I could have referred to Labor's broken promises with respect to defence spending and the visit of the Vietcong representatives during Anzac Week which I believe to be an insult to Australian exservicemen.

* In the Moorebank-Holsworthy and Anzac village areas the total army stock is 2,040 dwellings, 1,430 of which were obtained under Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and 610 by direct Commonwealth provision.

* -Last week two seemingly unrelated events occurred- one was Anzac Day, the other was the infamous sacking of Noel Latham by the Broken Hill City Council.

* We commemorate Anzac Day as an occasion to remember with pride and homage our glorious dead, those who paid the supreme sacrifice, those Australians whose blood was spilt on foreign fields.

* 1 ) How many accidents involving motor vehicles occurred at the Barney Crescent/ Anzac Parade intersections prior to the installation of 'Stop' signs.

* We recall also that His Royal Highness visited us again in  1965  to represent Her Majesty at the Jubilee of Anzac.

* I  move: 
It will be remembered that towards the end of my speech on the Appropriation Bill last Friday I referred to Anzac Day.

* I was speaking on 23rd April and Anzac Day was 2 days later, on 25th April.

* I said certain things before Anzac Day, and now I want to say certain things after Anzac Day.

* I was very pleased to see the great roll up of ex-servicemen in Anzac Day marches throughout Australia.

* I believe also that we should not make a holiday out of Anzac Day.

* When Anzac Day falls on a week day, a holiday should be held.

* But how can anyone justify having a holiday on the Monday following Anzac Day when it falls on a Sunday?

* On Anzac Day we commemorate the deeds of those men who fought in war.

* We do not glorify war on Anzac Day.

* I have been informed by some people who were listening to the radio broadcast of his speech that he said I would be attending my first Anzac Day ceremony this year.

* If he said that it would be my first Anzac Day ceremony in Parramatta he is inaccurate, because I have attended Anzac Day services in Parramatta on many occasions in the past.

* It is true that next Tuesday I shall be attending an Anzac Day service in Parramatta.

* I have attended Anzac Day services in Parramatta in the past, some of them at the place I shall be attending on this Anzac Day and some at the Returned Services League Club at Parramatta.

* I have also attended Anzac services for school children in Parramatta Park, hut not on Anzac Day.

* I have done this on several occasions during the IS years or so I have represented- 
 I believe it is very important that Anzac Day should continue to maintain its importance in the national calendar.

* I believe that the great majority, if not all, of the members on both sides of the House accept Anzac Day as one of our great national days.

* The commemoration of Anzac Day, the paying of tribute to all who have served Australia in the various theatres of war, continues even in very small towns throughout the Commonwealth.

* It is therefore a matter of regret to me that the sittings of this Parliament on the eve of Anzac Day could prevent members of the Federal Parliament from fulfilling commitments on Anzac Day in their own electorates.

* This could prevent me and no doubt other members from fulfilling commitments in their own electorates on Anzac Day.

* Government proposals show little appreciation of the importance of Anzac Day to the Australian people throughout the nation.

* Although I have been advised that it is the intention of the House to rise early on Wednesday, 24 April, this would not enable me to reach my home town in order to fulfil an engagement that I have accepted to be guest speaker at Anzac Day celebrations in my home town.

* I accepted the invitation to be guest speaker on that day because, as previously listed, Parliament was to sit the week preceding the week in which Anzac Day falls and the week in which Anzac Day falls was to have been a week when the House was not sitting.

* I register my protest that arrangements which probably allow metropolitan members to be in their electorates on Anzac Day but which deny that privilege to members who live in outlying areas are just not good enough in relation to a day as important as Anzac Day.

* The previous tentatively allocated sitting days notified were 17, 18 and 19 April, and the House was then not to sit during the week in which Anzac Day falls.

* I would like to know from the Minister why this program was altered to the disadvantage of members from outlying areas who want to be in the electorates for the celebration of Anzac Day.

* I believe that those members who live in outlying parts of this Commonwealth deserve consideration on such a day as Anzac Day.

* I raise this point with the Minister and register my protest against what I believe is a lack of recognition of the importance of Anzac Day and a lack of recognition of the needs of members from outlying areas.

* I advise the House that as Minister for Veterans' Affairs I visited the war cemeteries and Australian war memorials at Ypres, Zonnebeke and nearby sites on 2 March 1978, and those at Villers-Brettoneux on Anzac Day two weeks ago.

* There I took part in the Anzac Day ceremony and other ceremonies and laid wreaths at other memorials.

* During my visit in April to France I took the opportunity to spend Anzac Day at Villers-Brettoneux, in whose liberation Australian forces played a major part 60 years ago.

* Australians visit the Villers-Brettoneux memorial each Anzac Dayindeed, throughout the year- and each year the local people take part in the commemoration of Anzac Day.

* A party of 70 French school children - 
The new concession will come into operation on 1st April 1970, but will not be available for pensioners commencing travel over the Anzac Day weekend.

* Anzac Day is fast approaching.

* I go further and say that I hope it will be restored before Anzac Day so that those reserve decorations may be worn on that occasion by the people who have worked so hard and who are justifiably entitled to that award.
