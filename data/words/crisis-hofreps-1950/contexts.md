* considerable weakness, and in 1954, when the economic **crisis** reached such an intensity that it threatened to sweep the Government from office, it turned again to anti-communism and produced the Petrov commission, a rabbit out of the hat, as it was called by the press in many parts ofthe country.

* It is perfectly true that there is a **crisis** facing the dairying industry in the production and sale of butter, but similar difficulties have been faced and overcome by other rural industries of this country.

* In view of the case presented to the court by the trade unions, it is useless for the honorable member for Bendigo to say that we are facing an economic **crisis**.

* Before they returned to their States, they promised the Prime Minister of the day that they would refer powers to the Commonwealth Parliament to enable it to deal with any **crisis** that might arise in the post-war period.

* Does any one really think that in times of great national **crisis**, when the enemy is at our door, we should settle down to debate a subject involving two sets of irreconcilable ideas?

* The London " Spectator ", in its issue of 24th January last, published a commentary on a book entitled "The Crisis in Trade Unionism " which was written by  Mr Charles  Curran.

* It was written on lines along which I have been thinking for some time - that a **crisis** is coming in trade unions.

* We seem, from time to time, to move from one **crisis** to another.

* They regarded it as being justified because at that time a crises existed in the coal industry which had to be met as effectively as any **crisis** that arose in a time of war.

* I address a question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in relation to the **crisis** through which the dairying industry is passing at present.

* If it has done nothing else, it has demonstrated how utterly barren the Labour party is of any ability to deal with the complicated **crisis** that is facing this country and it has shown how utterly irresponsible honorable members of the Opposition are in their approach to national questions.

* We should have done something about it, and, if we had done it sooner, perhaps we would not have been faced with this chronic savings **crisis** which lies at the root of all our other economic troubles.

* Major Angus  Maude was one of the five rebels who resigned from the Conservative Party in Great Britain over the party's attitude on the withdrawal from Suez during the **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister certainly talked about integrating Australian and American forces - a proposal which my colleagues and I support wholeheartedly - but his statement recalled to the minds of many of us the dark days of 1942 when this country faced the greatest **crisis** in its history.

* Our exports have never been lower, and every member of the Government knows that we face a real financial **crisis** because of the failure of production, and the failure to increase our exports in order to enable us to meet our commitments at home and abroad.

* In times of great difficulty and **crisis** he was steady and sure in his handling of public affairs, and in his general leadership of New South Wales.

* The time is rapidly approaching when the people will deal most effectively with it for having failed them in this period of **crisis**.

* must admire the great courage and fine Australian spirit that were displayed by John Curtin during the great **crisis** in 1942-43.

* I doubt whether the amount being so spent would buy sufficient bandages for those wounded not in an atomic attack but in an attack with conventional bombs, let alone provide shelters and train personnel for a **crisis**.

* A political **crisis** arose in Victoria on one occasion because the Country party asked for a compulsory wheat pool, and the Liberal party of the day was not in favour of the proposal.

* T used that instance as an illustration that the coal industry generally was not in a state of **crisis**, and to confirm my point that, as a result of this re-organization, it was in a very much healthier and more satisfactory position to face the future.

* We will not resort to the expedients of ineffective solutions or passive compromise to pass from **crisis** to **crisis** only to find that our defence policy, our system of stabilizing industry and our efforts to promote industrial peace are held up.

* He included the Suez Canal episode, the **crisis** in the Middle East, the situation in Cyprus and Algeria, the meeting of Seato, the question of recognition of Red 
I turn now to our representation in Italy.

* I understand that that country is now passing through an unemployment **crisis** and that it has available labour of certain types that are greatly needed in this country.

* The **crisis** with which we are confronted in the world to-day is so well known that even the members of the Labour party ought to be aware of it, but the fact is that our capacity to prepare against emergency is, very largely, dependent upon two or three unions, against the Communist leaders of which this bill is primarily directed.

* If this Government were sincerely concerned about these problems, especially that confronting the coal-mining industry, it would ensure that this committee functioned and tried to do something to meet the **crisis**.

* When the Prime Minister was talking about war - whether with the United States because of the country's attitude on the Suez Canal **crisis**, or with Egypt - it was childish of him to suggest that Australia had any defence.

* It is  time  thatour Ministers made responsible decisions, I do not  see  that  any major  **crisis** should  have  developed because of the playing of 
Between 1911 and 1924 the Commonwealth Bank fulfilled every requirement including the requirements of five years of war.

* Thus, there are two instances of the bank board having failed this country in a time of **crisis**.

* Does not the Government realize that, in a time of **crisis**, which could arise as a result of the decision of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the basic wage case, the private banking system of this country could not find the money that even the War Service Homes Division required?

* There has been a consistent demand along the line that I have mentioned, yet it is only now in 1957, perhaps brought about by the greater realization of the necessity for it since the recent Suez **crisis**, that that decision has been made.

* The cries of its enemies that Marxism is "obsolete", that there is a "**crisis**" in Marxist philosophy, cannot stop the triumphant forward march of the ideas of dialectical materialism.

* There is no doubt that the Russians have precipitated what could be a serious **crisis** over Berlin, and I expect that discussions about Berlin will be the hard core of the Foreign Ministers' meetings, and subsequently of summit meetings.

* Last year, in a similar **crisis**, when we again ran out of money for this project, I attempted to get a deputation before the Minister for National 
The United States Government explained that these requests emerged from the circumstances of a general world shortage of wool and the special huge military requirements of the United States of wool for current use and for an emergency military reserve.

* The Australian Government declined to take any steps to suspend public auctions and took the stand that, except in a war **crisis**, maintenance pf the public auction system was essential to the well-being of the Australian wool industry.

* The hard facts of the housing **crisis** to-day are that housing commission homes, particularly, in New South Wales where the position is very serious, are becoming too dear to rent and out of the question to buy.

* So, he said that the basic economic issue underlying the whole of the Middle East situation, including the Suez **crisis**, is the struggle of world monopolies to control oil supplies.

* Australia is approaching a grave **crisis** in industry.

* Concurrently with the **crisis** in the Middle East, events in Eastern Europe have indicated the strains and stresses to which the satellite states are subject.

* Although it is difficult to generalize, I say that so far as the wool and sheep industry is concerned, I should not like it to be thought that we are now at a stage of **crisis**.

* The details of this incident can be read in books by Professor Copland, "The Battle of the Plans ", and " The Economic Crisis ", in which it is shown clearly by one of the leading writers on the Australian economy that that was the aim of that committee from the United Kingdom.

* It has been employed in times of **crisis** SUer as when timber piles up in our ports in Tasmania and when potatoes or fruit urgently require shipping space to mainland ports.

* In view of the vital nature of the discussions at present being held between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the  President  of the United States of America, and of the effect of any decisions made at that conference upon Australia's future, particularly those affecting the Pacific, will the Prime Minister inform the House whether the views of Australia and of the other dominions in the current **crisis** were sought by the United Kingdom Government prior to the departure of  Mr. Attlee  for the United States of America?

* To-day there is a **crisis** in the coal industry, and the Prime Minister's failure to take action indicates either that he is unconcerned about the situation or that he has no remedy for it.

* It seems that, as always in times of economic **crisis**, or disemployment, the first section to be affected is that composed of the working people.

* It has served Australia in times of **crisis** and has brought solvency to those concerns which are the basis of our economy.

* As I said only a few nights ago, if there is one thing which we can expect from the Government in a **crisis** it is a display of absolute inertia.

* .- We are dealing wilh a paper relating to the national economy, and I should like to say, at the outset, that I deplore the phrase that has- been used in the course of the debate when it has been stated that we are dealing with an economic **crisis**.

* What would be wrong with such a move in this hour of **crisis**?

* Indeed, all governments use this device in time of **crisis**, but I do not think we would be justified in using it at present.

* We need to trade with other countries and as long as we have substantially the basis for the development of our own economy, we shall be able to meet a **crisis** of the kind which we could not meet in the 1930's because our secondary industries had not developed to the point at which we could cope with many of the troubles which arose.

* I have not the slightest doubt that one of these days the Prime Minister, if he remains in office long enough, will make another trip to Egypt; but he will not be going there to settle the Middle East **crisis**.

* I ask the Minister whether the Commonwealth Government's financial practice and policy precludes it from giving a particular State or a particular industry any assistance when it is in distress, although the Commonwealth may give special assistance when there is a national **crisis** such as a drought or flood.

* So, lack of trading facilities not only does not weaken the central bank but strengthens it because, in a time of economic **crisis**, if the central bank had to call up additional reserves from the private trading banks, those banks, knowing that the central bank was a true reserve bank, would appreciate that it would not do anything that it should not do.

* As I said a few minutes ago, in its period of **crisis** the United States of America is turning to cheaper money.

* In that State there is a **crisis** in education, due to a lack of necessary facilities.

* In 1951, after the horror budget had piled burden after burden on the taxpayers in order  to  meet an economic **crisis**, a single man on the basic wage was required to pay 38 2s.

* In 1953, after  a  tax reduction budget that is supposed  to  reduce the burdens of the taxpayers because the economic **crisis** has been overcome, such a man will  be  required  to  pay 46 3s.

* In view of the serious man-power shortage in the dairying industry which has created a **crisis** in butter production, will the Minister for Immigration say how many new Australians have been allotted to the dairy industry?

* The committee has found that the coal **crisis** is due to a falling off in the demand for coal because of inadequate national development and the lack of an oil-from-coal industry in Australia.

* That is an appalling attitude for a national government to adopt in the present road **crisis**.

* I am of the very definite opinion that honorable members on this side of the House have dealt with the subject of the shortage of homes in a manner that proves beyond a shadow of doubt that a **crisis** does exist, despite all the political pot-boiling, excuses and subterfuges that have been indulged in by supporters of the Government.

* Does the right honorable gentleman believe that Australia is heading for a similar serious **crisis** that will have disastrous consequences unless steps are taken immediately to prevent the present runaway catastrophic inflation?

* However, the country is now passing through not only small internal troubles, but also large external troubles and I believe that this budget will, to some extent, put the country in a position to meet that **crisis** if it is to come, although we all hope that it will not come.

* Opposition members should have said, " This is a national **crisis** which" has been brought about by exceptional circumstances.

* Instead, during the dark days of the economic **crisis** they criticized the Government at every opportunity, and when the first sign of unemployment appeared they endeavoured to magnify  h  for political purposes.

* Surely the time must be near, particularly in view of the approaching **crisis** that the Government is facing, when younger members on the Government side could be pushed forward to replace the older members of the Cabinet who must be feeling the strain of their age.

* The central bank controls the advance policy of trading banks, and that control can be exercised fairly rigidly in times of **crisis**.

* Without arbitral procedure, it is facing a tremendous economic **crisis** because of industrial unrest which is spreading all over the country.

* As the Government's precipitate action in curtailing imports has caused a national **crisis** and a weakening of the entire British economy, when does the Treasurer envisage the restrictions being removed and what action is the Government taking to ensure that it will not be necessary to re-impose them.

* Do not let, us imagine that we are in the throes of a **crisis**, or dealing, as the Opposition would like people to think, with an imminent depression.

* As our wool cheque is becoming less year by year, and we are finding it increasingly difficult to sell our other exports due to the shrinkage of world markets, this **crisis** is approaching very rapidly.

* When the time of **crisis** arrives there will be need for strong and determined action by the Government.

* We are here to face the greatest **crisis** that has confronted us since the end of World War II., and in that spirit to try to hammer out a policy and endeavour to convey it to the nation as a whole so that it will accept the policy as a recommendation from the Parliament as the best means of dealing with a common danger in the interests of the Australian people.

* For a period - the shortest possible period - the department will have the policy responsibility of regulating our imports by licensing to avoid the development of any **crisis** in our balance of payments situation.

* At this moment of world **crisis** in the butter market, the first thing to do is to ensure that confidence shall be restored to the dairying industry.

* Prior to the Suez **crisis** an Australian trade commissioner was stationed at Cairo, and Egypt was not an unimportant trading centre from the Australian viewpoint.

* The country was faced with a financial **crisis** which was the result of a policy of dictatorship which was implemented by the banking interests.

* A stage has been reached in the industry which borders on disaster, and the threatening **crisis** demands bold measures.

* From that starting point, the Labour Government quickly built up a magnificent organization for the production of munitions of war, and was enthusiastically supported by the people, who turned against the present Government parties because of their failure to deal effectively with the **crisis** through which the country was passing.

* Similarly, during the coal **crisis** of 1949 we did not talk, we acted Deeds not words.

* Mr. Curtin  contended that if, a week after the Munich **crisis**, the Government had claimed that additional finance was required for defence purposes, that was an indication that insufficient provision had been made previously.

* The people of Australia must have been astounded to hear the great heights to which the Treasurer can rise when he announces his budget, and reveals so vividly that we are in a period of **crisis** and suffering the effects of inflation.

* According to experts, a **crisis** is likely to be reached in 1954, because by that time the huge armaments of the Soviet Union and its satellites will bt- obsolescent, and the temptation will bo to put them into use.

* No measures are taken to ensure that the purchasing power of payments keeps pace with inflationary tendencies, and there is every fear that with mounting unemployment and the deepening economic **crisis**, the Government may again turn to the ready expedient of further reducing social services rates.

* I was interested to recall a page from Trotsky's  Life of Stalin  written in 1940, before the atomic **crisis**, and referring to a man called Krassin who made the original explosives for the Bolsheviks in the 1901-02 period.

* It is of no use to say that we shall meet the **crisis** when it comes.

* The **crisis** is already here.

* Let us cast our minds back to the 1930's, when the judges of the High Court refused to accept a reduction of their salaries during the terrible **crisis** of the depression.

* Considering the effect of the reduction of the basic wage upon the purchasing power of the workers, one can readily understand that it had a vital influence upon the severity of the economic **crisis**.

* But even now, since the easing of, the **crisis** which precipitated the formation of that treaty, there is evidence of a less ready acceptance of submission to a unified command, and it is indeed a problem which confronts the Nato Council and the Secretary-General, Lord  Ismay,  to this very day - how to reconcile this reluctance to continue the unified command, and the maintenance of large standing armies, with the necessity to retain defence dispositions.

* As a matter of fact this country and the British Commonwealth were much nearer to war during the **crisis** of the Berlin airlift in 1948, when Russian planes " buzzed " British planes and shot down an American plane, than we are at this particular moment in Europe.

* The condition of successful co-operation in this **crisis** is that the Government abandon its high handed attitude of blind adherence to the negative policy of excessive taxation and the equally negative policy of arbitrary restriction of bank credit.

* The fact remains that the extraordinary **crisis** through which we are passing to-day is of the Government's own making.

* I have not been advised that there is any **crisis** circumstance there, but I shall take the matter up immediately and supply the honorable member with a statement of the position.

* is perhaps the greatest **crisis** in its history.

* When that **crisis** threatened to develop, they shirked their responsibilities, and surrendered.

* They were not " game " to face the electors; and surrendered in the hour of **crisis**.

* It is easy to criticize a decision some years after it was made, but it would be an entirely different matter to accept the responsibility for making that decision in a time of **crisis**.

* Should they happen to regain power during a time of depression, with all the machinery that we have supplied for factories, and all the other things we have provided, together with a necessary lowering of wages which a **crisis** would cause, they would gain kudos for capturing the world's market with our goods at the right prices.

* One is the Middle East **crisis** over the Suez Canal and the proposal of the Australian Labour movement to establish a United Nations Middle East organization aimed at the establishment of a social and international order requiring regulation by the United Nations of matters such as power, water potential, food production, and the details of that economic arrangement which would have to be determined.

* I would ask the honorable member for Fawkner  (Mr. Howson)  to look at publications such as that on the " Australian Transport Crisis", detailing the discussion and papers at the Australian Institute of Political Science summer school in Canberra three years ago.

* Each year, a new **crisis** will be created and, in order to meet it, we shall have to expand our economy further.

* They had such an opportunity recently during the **crisis** on the coal-fields but instead of joining in the fight against communism they inserted advertisements in the press of this country which gave a stimulus to the Communist cause.

* In view of the very bad and deteriorating condition of the Australian roads system, it is not an exaggeration to say, particularly in view of the recent floods, that Australian roads have reached a state of **crisis**.

* It is not even prepared to help industries that will be essential to national defence in a time of **crisis**.

* In this time of **crisis**, surely we should not lightly throw away and destroy a great asset such as this.

* The Government has no intention of waiting for a **crisis** before taking positive steps.

* Since the Berlin **crisis** of 1948, all the signs have pointed to an immediate concentration of Communist pressure in Asia and South-East Asia rather than in Europe.

* On 7th November, the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  said that he attributed the whole responsibility for the Middle East tension and **crisis** to Soviet influence.

* The Government itself has no authority to order priorities, but I am glad to say that the overseas shipping companies have at all times indicated their complete willingness, in a **crisis** of the character brought about by the recent waterfront dispute, to act in accordance with what the Government officials regard as the highest order of priority in the loading and unloading of cargoes.

* Earlier this evening, the honorable member for Bendigo  (Mr. Clarey)  pointed out that in the 1952-53 **crisis** there were more than 100,000 unemployed, and a similar position will soon exist again.

* It is important to recall the facts of what has really happened in this Middle East **crisis**.

* Those who wish to " shanghai " every eligible person into the Army, regardless of his sincerely held religious beliefs, should remember that these regulations, which operated during the period of the greatest **crisis** in our history, gave to conscientious objectors the right of appeal against the decisions of magistrates ordering them to serve in the armed forces.

* A competent court of summary jurisdiction, if satisfied, upon an application duly made to it under these Regulations, or the appropriate court, if satisfied on appeal, that the applicant holds a genuine conscientious belief that it is wrong - 
An over-rapid rate of inflation intensifies the " social " injustices of the unequal incidence on different sections of the community and can lead to hasty **crisis** measures which may do more harm than good.

* I ask also whether, during the **crisis** of the last ten days in the Middle East generally and in the Suez area in particular, Australia has exchanged views with those members of the British Commonwealth which are even more intimately concerned than we are.

* It must be placed on a stabilized basis to allow for expansion in time of national or international **crisis**.

* The Merchant Service Guild feels that it is important that a ship should have its full complement of officers to take the watches and to act in a **crisis**, and that there should be greater safeguards than there are in the measure.

* That basis has been endangered by a world **crisis** in butter marketing.

* .- The Leader of the Opposition  (Dr. Evatt)  reminds me of an old United Kingdom Prime Minister who said, at some point of time of great national **crisis** in his country, " The time is ripe for something to be done.

* Following the **crisis** in July, 1947, when the United Kingdom attempted 'to restore full convertibility of sterling with the dollar, and again in the middle of 1949, when there was a sudden and severe drain on the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area, restrictions' on dollar imports were made progressively more severe until only the absolute minimum of essential supplies was being obtained from dollar sources.

* There is an arms race in progress at present, and it will continue until a **crisis** is reached unless we take action to obtain peaceful co-existence.

* Owing to the present world conditions and to the fact that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has now cancelled the export of all supplies of chromite ore to the United States of America, deposits in other countries, preferably the democracies, must now be developed in order to prevent any chance of the curtailment  or cessation of supplies of this vital ore in times of **crisis**.

* In times of **crisis**, the Leader of the Opposition has supported the rights of the individual against the encroachment of fascism on the one hand, and of communism on the other hand.

* If they make such a request, the government then in power should consider it with sympathy and say, "We must consider their views and treat them as generously as we possibly can, in the light of the fact that they considered the needs of the nation in its time of **crisis** ".

* I believe that the wool **crisis** is very important to Australia. "

* I call on the Government to take some action to meet the **crisis** that is affecting these people.

* The Minister for National Development  (Senator Spooner)  has said repeatedly that there is no **crisis** in the coalmining industry.

* Of course there is no **crisis** in the coal-mining industry as it affects those who operate the industry and have mechanized it so that they have been able to do without great numbers of men in this important industry!

* In that work Professor Laski said, " The mere fact that we do not know the limits of the Royal power that remains to be invoked on one side or the other in the twilight zone of **crisis** is sufficient evidence to indicate the difficulties of the position ".

* If it does, Australia will find itself facing an economic **crisis** similar to that of 1952.

* In view of the Prime Minister's published statements on the latest Middle East **crisis** and its effect upon Australia, will the right honorable gentleman give to this House and to the Australian people an assurance that he will take immediate steps to have all our naval vessels surveyed, overhauled and reconditioned, so that they will be ready for immediate action in the event of hostilities?

* In view of the serious consequences of the shortage of wheat to our cost of living, and to the poultry and milling industries and certain export industries, will the Minister recommend to the Government that the matter be treated on a national basis, and that money required to meet the situation should be provided from national sources, not by the citizens of one State during a temporary **crisis**?

* The aged and infirm, or those suffering from chronic heart conditions, want a telephone so that it can be used in a **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister last night denied that there was a slump or a **crisis** in the building industry.

* Mark you, the Prime Minister says there is no **crisis** and there is no slump in the building industry, but these Ministers are men who do not live in an ivory tower, as does the Prime Minister when the problem of housing is brought up, but are occupied every waking moment of their lives in trying to solve the housing problems in their respective States, and after the conference they arrived at a unanimous conclusion.

* Report after report has drawn attention to the fact that our roads are incapable of coping with a **crisis**.

* The honorable member for East Sydney said that the last thing the Government, wants to do is to publicize the viewpoint of the Opposition on this **crisis**.

* He did say, quite correctly, that a temporary use of bank credit is the right thing in a **crisis**.

* We cannot always be retiring from place after place, facing **crisis** after **crisis**.

* She declined to take part in the Suez **crisis**.

* That position was amply illustrated last year during the **crisis** which arose over the adverse trade balance.

* The figures clearly indicate that the Australian banking system was confronted with a severe financial **crisis**.

* They know now that a Labour government, which did such a grand job in the dark days of the war, can successfully overcome the economic **crisis**.

* I contend that in times of national **crisis** the Opposition should join with the Government in informing the people of the seriousness of the situation.

* I submit that the statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  during the Suez **crisis**, that we must protect our aggressive sovereignty in the Middle East, is a complete denial of the rule of law.

* Instead of playing a political game in a time of financial **crisis**, he could have been big enough to acknowledge that this situation affects everybody in the country and not only the section from which he can seek political advantage.

* One would have thought that, in view of the universal hope that there should be a peaceful settlement of this tremendous **crisis**, there would have been some eagerness on the part of the Australian Government to face up to the position, but there has been no real change in our defence potential for many years now.

* This cold statement of fact by  Dr. Coombs  shows that in the economic **crisis** many of the private banks contributed to the inflationary situation, seeking first and foremost their own profits.

* I remind honorable members opposite, after hearing them talk about Wallstreet and Washington having a possible bad influence on this country, that at a time of great **crisis** when we were facing invasion they were very quick to call upon the Americans for aid.

* Should a further grave economic **crisis** beset Australia, the trading banks will be forced to rely upon the central bank.

* However, in October, 1955, as a result of the then existing financial **crisis** in Great Britain, the Conservative Government was forced to increase the tax to 60 per cent.

* We on both sides  of  the House have something to learn from the faith he held, namely, that parliamentary institutions can serve the purpose of the nation; that they can bring substantial benefits to, and perform major tasks on behalf of the people in any emergency, and in any **crisis**.

* What is the cause of the Middle East **crisis**?

* The Australian Government should realize that the basic economic issue underlying the whole of the Middle East situation, including the Suez **crisis**, is the struggle of the world monopolies to control oil supplies.

* Steps have to be taken to correct this position otherwise, whether we like it or not, in the near future we will be facing a **crisis**.

* He had said that no **crisis** existed in the housing field in Australia, and that if it were not for a shortage of man power and materials, the lag in housing would be overtaken.

* Was it not the same Prime Minister who was faced with a **crisis** in 1941?

* That must not happen, especially at the present time, when the Government is howling about the need to preserve overseas balances, and is plunging the country into an economic **crisis** because of the demands that imports are making upon those balances.

* The third is increased drinking of alcoholic liquor, which leads to loss of the concentration that people need in a **crisis** on the roads.

* As the rural fire brigades wireless network is a very important  alternative method of communication in times of national stress or **crisis**, will the Minister give his favorable consideration to this application?

* Thus, whilst it is proposed that essential imports shall be restricted because of what the Government describes as our present economic **crisis**, provision is being made for dollar expenditure to import equipment for what is purely and simply a luxury service.

* In times of **crisis** they invariably crawl into their burrows and let the nation down.

* He knows that the 1949 coal strike was a national **crisis**, and that it caused widespread unemployment.

* We can create a **crisis** in Australia by great foolishness if we curtail immigration and stop development.

* In the banking legislation which the Government has brought forward it has en deavoured to ensure, as far as an act of Parliament can, that on one hand the public financial institutions shall have their reasonable rights preserved and, on the other hand, that the private banking interests and private enterprise shall be given reasonable freedom, and that in the Reserve Bank there shall be embodied principles which will enable it, in time of **crisis**, to control certain of the financial aspects of our economy, and also to prevent crises from occurring.

* The value of the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings was seen so recently as last Tuesday night when the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  and the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* The late Professor Laski, an admirer of the right honorable member for Barton and, indeed, a very close colleague of his when he was alive, had this to say in " Democracy and Crisis " - 
Yes, and Professor Laski continues in his book " Democracy in Crisis " - 
The mere fact that we do not know the limits of the Royal power,  that  it can remain to be invoked, on one side or the other, in the twilight zone of **crisis**, sufficiently indicates the difficulties of the position.

* Nothing could suit the Egyptian dictator better than for the free world to lose interest, or a sense of **crisis** or a sense of urgency.

* There would be a rush upon the bank by depositors, a feeling of insecurity would develop in the commercial community, and we should be involved in a **crisis** that everybody would be most anxious to avoid.

* Only the gravest type of crises and the assurance that the legislation could substantially abate such a **crisis** would warrant such legislation.

* If so, will he state whether the Government is deliberately depressing the bond market for the purpose of raising the bank interest rate and for other purposes associated with the nation's present economic **crisis**, and whether, if the bond market is to be unpegged, as recommended by eight professors of economics recently, the Treasury is following this course in order to create fear and consternation in the minds of the people as a preliminary to the introduction of a budget similar to that of the year 1951-52 f 
The housing **crisis** in Australia is a direct outcome of this situation.

* Everything that has been done by the parties that are represented on this side of the House has been designed to strengthen the bank, because we believe it to be to the advantage of everybody that the Commonwealth Bank shall be strong and able to withstand the shocks that it must sustain in any financial **crisis**.

* Dealing with the relative qualities of a board and a single governor, he wrote - 
Is the Prime Minister aware that a **crisis** has arisen in the coal-mining industry in Tasmania and that unemployment is imminent because the consumption of coal in that State is lagging behind production which, at present, is a record ?

* We are reaching a stage of **crisis** in this matter, and I think that the Government should take some action on it.

* That letter, which gives the lie to those who say that pressure was not brought to bear on the government of the day to reduce social service benefits and wages, appears in " The Crisis in Australian Finance ", by Shann and Copland, at page 182, if any honorable member wants to verify it.

* The cause of the current industry **crisis**  is  world overproduction of lead and zinc.

* Can the right honorable gentleman take comfort from the probability that his blunder in this matter is no greater than that of the Prime Minister in relation to the Suez **crisis**?

* Nothing less will suffice to meet the growing **crisis**.

* I do not expect the Government to accept in full the proposals on this vexed subject made by the miners' federation, but how does the Government propose to meet the **crisis** in this great national industry?

* All that the department had to say about the plight of the people on the coal-fields was - 
I want to refer briefly to the **crisis** in the wheat industry which has been precipitated by the uncompromising attitude of two socialist Premiers in refusing topay a reasonable price for wheat for local consumption.

* However, our experience in Australia has shown the impossibility of obtaining the latest types of aircraft when a **crisis** arrives, and we must accept the huge expenditure involved in local manufacture as a price we must pay for the insurance, of our security.

* The budget is designed to meet the **crisis** of a war emergency, to ensure the adequate defence of this  coun-  try and to enable us to discharge our obligations to the United Nations and our obligations under the Pacific Pact.

* All those circumstances are precisely the same, yet it was written 30 years ago, less than five years before the .entire world was plunged 'into the most bitter depths of economic **crisis** and human misery.

* The honorable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr. Eraser)  said that his motion was prompted by the **crisis** in the dairying industry and he promised that his speech would not consist of an attack upon the Government and that it would not raise party political issues.

* I shall say something later about whether or not there is a. **crisis** in the industry.

* We can examine the condition of the dairying industry either upon the basis that a **crisis** exists - and if that is to be the approach, it will be necessary to establish that a **crisis** does exist - or upon the basis that there is a case for doing something for the industry in order to ensure its expansion and a higher degree of profitability.

* If I believed that a **crisis** did exist in the industry, I should not feel obliged to deny that it existed, because obviously this Government could not have created it during its one short year of life.

* In these circumstances it would be pointless for me to pretend that a **crisis** did not exist.

* But after fifteen months as the Minister for Supply in a growing defence **crisis** in this country, I am completely convinced that we cannot coordinate defence production as between defence and civil needs unless we have  some  authority to do so.

* On a former occasion, when the Australian workers were faced with an economic **crisis**, the Minister for Labour and National Service said - 
In matters of trade union organization the Ministry, whether Labour or antiLabour, should act bona fide.

* Governments down the years have depended on the trade unions to organize and govern themselves, whether the going be smooth or a **crisis** exists.

* The most significant fact arising from the world situation in recent times is one which emerged during the Hungarian dispute and the Suez **crisis** in 1956-57.

* At the same time the Egyptian **crisis** disclosed the complete impossibility of the tenure of the Western powers, notably Britain, in the Middle East.

* The department co-operates with industry in production, and naturally we establish industrial annexes and provide industry with know-how so that-we can call upon industry and expand rapidly in case of **crisis**.

* The national interest must come first and -although as pointed out appreciation of the Australian 1 is not a panacea for the present inflationary **crisis**, it world tend to halt the present rise in prices and prevent exploitation of the people by primary interests.

* The Australian Government declined to take any steps to suspend public auctions and took the stand that, except in a war **crisis**, maintenance of the public auction system was essential to the well being of the Australian wool industry.

* I know others differ from that opinion, but I also know that when the great war **crisis** confronted Australia and questions of credit either to or away from this country arose, action had to be taken very quickly in special fields, otherwise no good would have resulted.

* I remember especially the work that he did during the great **crisis** of World War II.

* On the last sitting day I asked the Acting Prime Minister whether he would consult with the Minister for External Affairs in relation to the recommendations of the recent London conference on the Suez Canal **crisis**, my question being designed to obtain a statement whether those recommendations are the basis of the present negotiations between the parties concerned.

* The threatening **crisis** demands bold measures.

* All that means, in the terms of  Mr.  Justice Davidson's report, that the bold measures which were taken have been bringing their reward and that the **crisis** which threatened the industry, bringing it, as he said, to the borders of disaster, has been overtaken.

* I agree entirely with the statement of the Premier of New South Wales, as reported in this morning's newspaper, that he thinks that this **crisis**, as he calls it, is temporary.

* I agree with the New South Wales Premier that what he describes as a **crisis** is something temporary.

* The Budget ignores the opportunity that now exists to end the housing **crisis** and at the same time enable a large percentage of those people who are to-day without useful employment to return to work.

* Can the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that a **crisis** exists in this country due to the lack of housing to accommodate the people of the Australian community?

* They are, first, the atomic position and the development of the other new weapons which may emerge side by side with the grim advance of atomic science; secondly, the position of the United Nations and how that has been abused, or could be used in this new **crisis**; and thirdly, the way in which free men must endeavour to unite against the forces of tyranny which once appeared in nazi guise and now appear in Communist guise, because in both cases they are the same forces.

* But the Speech did refer to the **crisis** in Egypt.

* It has been proved in both the Federal and State spheres' that coalition governments formed by the parties opposite are unable to provide a. stable government in a time of **crisis**.

* After dealing with various aspects of the **crisis** that then existed in the coal industry, including references to the activities of the Joint Coal Board, the right honorable gentleman, as reported in  Hansard,  volume 202, at page 1181, stated - 
Of course, the Government is facing a **crisis**.

* We should not be afraid to meet this **crisis** caused by what might be termed the threatened outbreak of peace.

* America the most complex practices were adopted, but in times of great, national **crisis** or of rapid economic development, it has been found that the note issue must be increased by legislative action.

* It was only because England found itself in a miraculous position, in which it usually finds itself when it is confronted with a **crisis**, that trouble was avoided.

* Even the budget, which was presented after much futile argument within the Government parties, gives no indication that the Government will take any of the legislative courses, popular or otherwise, that would be necessary to restore economic stability in the face of the approaching **crisis**.

* But there was a **crisis** in the Labour party in Holland which led to the resignation of  Mr. Drees,  the Prime Minister.

* We are now being warned, in the middle of what is claimed to be the greatest period of prosperity that we have ever known, of the possibility of a depression or financial **crisis**.

* In the 1931 Halley Stewart Lecture, entitled "The World's Economic Crisis", he stated - 
None of that oil is produced in Australia.

* An explanation of the attitude of the Persian Government towards Great Britain in the present oil **crisis** could be found in Moscow.

* A re-assessment of our whole trade, if it were not overdue before the Suez **crisis*** is certainly warranted now in the light' of recent events.

* When the 1945 banking legislation was before the House I pointed out, as a spokesman for the Government, that the legislation originated in the **crisis** of the 'thirties.

* Had that **crisis** not occurred and had the Australian Government not been defied by banks, private and government, the legislation would never have been placed on the statute-book.

* I am certain that, on the basis of the evidence in recent years of how we can ride a **crisis** and emerge triumphantly from it, the public of Australia will return the Menzies Government to office on the 29th May next.

* If the little marriage guidance counsellor comes tootling along on his bike people will know that some one is suffering a matrimonial **crisis**, and the position will be very difficult indeed.

* What is the attitude of the Labour party in the present ' **crisis** ; because it is a **crisis** ?

* To abandon the United Nations in this **crisis** would be unthinkable after we have for so many years given our allegiance to its principles.

* The honorable member for Kennedy and his colleagues have referred to the housing problem as a housing **crisis**.

* I suggest that, if a **crisis** exists to-day, it existed throughout the Labour government's term ot office because the housing position is incomparably better at present than at any time under the Labour government.

* It seems to me that the situation at the present time is not the **crisis** that some of the more vocal gentlemen of the Opposition would have us believe.

* There is not a **crisis** in housing in Australia to-day; there is a problem.

* The' recently published war history which gives details of the 30,000 rifles, shells, equipment and antiaircraft guns supplied to the United Kingdom by Australia shows clearly that even the United Kingdom can be pressed for supplies of essential arms, munitions and equipment in a **crisis**.

* So, at the opening of a new Parliament,, the new legislative proposals of a government which is supposed to be in control of the affairs of a dynamic nation - its plansto meet the **crisis** of our times and to keep pace with our development - boil down tosimplifying the procedure of naturalization" and enlarging the membership of the Northern Territory Legislative Council.

* What are the objectives of the Government in the present **crisis**?

* This **crisis** is a recurring one.

* To sum up the present position, the probability is that a cabinet **crisis** will be avoided and that order will  be restored.

* If so does it not appear that a serious **crisis**- in the affairs of the United Nations may now have been reached  
.- I support the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell).

* I point out that the tax was imposed in 1949-41 at a time of national **crisis** when the government was straining every nerve to raise money for the sinews of war.

* Not once in our history have we had a coalition government which, in a period of **crisis**, has offered us a. strong and responsible administration or given a lead to our people who, in good times or in bad times, demand from their government only a lead and a course to follow.

* If there is one thing you can rely on the present Federal Government for when any sort of real **crisis** approaches, it is complete and absolute inertia.

* As the level of unemployment has risen, the Minister has been intent, not  on  correcting the situation  by  developing a plan to meet the **crisis**, but rather  on  finding a basis for a false comparison of figures relating to the work force.

* It is just as much a necessity because it is invoked in times of **crisis** and affects so very many people.

* I repeat that there should be a spring-cleaning and that, in a friendly way, we should endeavour to persuade the unions to look at their own country instead of contributing to the troubles of other countries, and to try to get their own country out of a national emergency or **crisis**.

* This time last year, Australia was passing through a great **crisis**.

* I ask the Minister for Territories: Is it a fact that a **crisis** has developed in the ranks of Government supporters in regard to the proposed taxation of residents of New Guinea?

* Those words have a precise meaning, and, as the American Bar Association has indicated, it is simply because they are not understood that we are lumbering on from one crag of **crisis** to another.

* Our party was the one to which the people of Australia turned during the supreme **crisis** of World War II.

* In his own words, he dates the serious economic **crisis** that is confronting Australia from some time in 1950-51, and that was more than twelve months after his Government had been returned to office.

* Do not let us wait until a **crisis** occurs in that country.

* A British journalist, Paul Johnson, recently had this to say about Kuwait - 
We have the courage and we have worked hard, but honorable members opposite are doing everything within their power io prevent the trade unions from cooperating with us in the **crisis** that faces Australia at present.

* Last night, I outlined the **crisis** which has arisen in the timber export industry in Tasmania because approximately 8,000,000 super, feet of timber is awaiting shipment at five northern ports.

* Will the Prime Minister examine my speech, if he has time- 
I authorized the reply to which the honorable member has referred by reason of the fact that it is not the practice of this Government to make comments on the intimate affairs of another government, particularly in circumstances of such - I think they can be called - a **crisis** nature that exist in Cyprus to-day.

* It has almost become accepted as normal that every country tries to export its **crisis** and export its unemployment by devaluations and trade restrictions.

* The budget speech of the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden)  in 1952 was one of the most interesting he has ever delivered because, in it, he looked back to what he himself called his horror budget, the budget in which he faced an inflationary **crisis** when the government of the time decided to increase income tax by 10 per cent!, and to increase sales tax.

* Looking back on that budget two years afterwards, the Treasurer had this to say, and I quote it because it shows that what we have to-day is, in some respects, a repetition of that time, but with one important difference - 
That is what the Treasurer said two years later, when the inflationary **crisis**, he held, had been corrected by the financial proposals that he had introduced.

* The other measure which the Government took to deal with that **crisis** was a heavy rise in income tax.

* I feel that there is a certain softening of what I may call the Government's moral fibre and determination in dealing with the present **crisis**, I am not saying this to score a party political point, but in an effort to analyse what is the Teal situation.

* Secondly, I do not believe - not because the Government has proposed it, but for the reasons I have advanced - that raising the interest rate on overdrafts by 1 per cent, is a weapon to use in overcoming the kind of **crisis** that the Government says is before us.

* For the last few weeks, Ministers, and people in very high places in this nation, have issued warnings of an impending **crisis**, of a danger facing Australia.

* But sometimes a **crisis** arises unexpectedly.

* Australia's food **crisis** should be a good reason for giving access to the land to the great masses of Australians, as well as to new Australians, and the best way to do that is to break up large estates.

* In order to meet a **crisis** which had arisen in regard to the balance of payments between the United Kingdom and the United States of America the  bloc  known as the sterling  bloc  was obliged to cut dollar commitments by 20 per cent.

* As far as it can, the Government has provided for real and practical deflationary measures to be taken against the inflationary **crisis**.

* They have been in the regimen of free medicine and because of some whimsical decision of a panel that they should go, quite a **crisis** has been created in the minds of these people.

* As I have said previously, I am greatly concerned about the **crisis** that is developing in the coal industry.

* I can assure the House that, whilst I yield to no man in my desire to protect the civil rights of persons' in Australia, there are times of **crisis** when the safety of the people as a whole must override ordinary court procedure.

* To this general confusion of thought and interplay of self-interest the banks contributed in the early stages of the **crisis**.

* At the time of the Suez Canal **crisis** conditions existed which made possible a global war.

* The world must become conditioned to living in a state of **crisis** for many years to come.

* Everybody knows, or should know, that the representatives of the United Nations are continually negotiating with Colonel Nasser in order to overcome the Suez **crisis**.

* He has conveyed the impression that the economic **crisis** has passed, and that our inflationary problems have been solved.

* As an exserviceman, shivers ran down my back at the thought that a time of **crisis** should be considered to be the time to -impose conscription and start to train manpower.

* It will be obvious that the **crisis** facing the coastal shipping trade is the problem of replacing ships which, in a few years, will be out of date and for the replacement of which capital has to be found.

* If the Minister for External Affairs were present he would resent the insinuation of the honorable member for Watson that he did not handle the Suez **crisis**.

* There is most certainly no **crisis** in the morale of the Royal Australian Navy.

* I should like to refer now to the **crisis** that will undoubtedly develop in Tasmania as a consequence of the recent action of the United States Government in imposing restrictions on imports of lead and zinc.

* I assure the House that the reactions of our neighbours in the near north to the Suez **crisis** were very unfavorable.

* The late King George reigned throughout a period of tremendous **crisis**, not only in British history, but also in all history.

* Indeed, he ascended the throne following upon an unexpected constitutional **crisis**.

* That **crisis** did not end in 1945 with the ending of the war, and in some respects the sacrifices of our kinsmen in Great Britain are as great to-day as they were during the most critical period of the war itself.

* The requests were made in evidence before the Tariff Board, and were made because, it was claimed, the industry was in a state of **crisis**.

* I address to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question which arises from the **crisis** that exists in the small fruits industry in Tasmania.

* The country is faced by an economic **crisis**.

* The fourth reason for Tasmania's **crisis** is shipping.

* Of course there is a housing **crisis** in this country.

* It apparently does not appreciate that it is necessary to give incentives to the workers who, after all, are the ones who fight for the country in time of national **crisis**.

* At question time this morning I asked the Treasurer whether, in view of the fact that Tasmania will get only 142,000 from the recent Commonwealth grant to the States, and as unemployment in Tasmania is at its highest level for 13 years, and as 900 applications for home loans are registered with the Agricultural Bank at Hobart - to mention only one aspect of the housing problem - he would consider making a special direct grant to Tasmania of at least 500,000, as has been done in the case of nearly every other State that has faced a similar economic **crisis**.

* Although, inevitably, there is an area of agreement in many of the matters to which the Minister referred - the policy of aid to Asian countries, the operation of that plan which, although it was not called the Colombo plan, was originally initiated under the Government of the late  Mr. Chifley  and which we have supported, and other matters in the same category - what strikes me, frankly, about the speech, as a whole, is the rather jolly way in which the right honorable gentleman closed the door against practically every attempt that might be made at international conciliation at this very **crisis** in the world's history.

* Hence the economic **crisis** in which we find ourselves and which was so caustically dealt with by the honorable member for Wannon.

* I  ask the Minister to take immediate action to meet the **crisis**, which has been aggravated by further recent dismissals from Commonwealth departments and private industrial undertakings within the electorate of Macquarie.

* Such a debate  is  supposed to produce  a  political **crisis**.

* The economic **crisis** is so grave that any government which tackles this problem, as it should be tackled1 will have to do a lot of unpopular things.

* The economic **crisis** is so very grave that any government which tackles this problem as it should be tackled will have to do a lot of unpopular things.

* increase in industrial production or a defence **crisis**.

* The urgent necessity of immediate action to protect Australian primary industries in lie present shipping **crisis** occasioned by the  unjus tified  and exorbitant demands of the Overseas Shipping interests.

* In this time of financial **crisis** the proper functioning of this aluminium industry would save Australia approximately 5,000,000 dollars a year.

* That is particularly so now, when we know that the world situation is one of extreme **crisis**.

* I approach the subject before the House in that spirit, because I feel that unless we can convey to the people of Australia through this National Parliament an understanding of the belief of all members that there is a great and present danger and an extreme **crisis**, we shall have failed in the first responsibility that the Parliament has to the people.

* I say that in all sincerity because I believe that, even by December, the economic state of this country will be such that the Australian people will know full well once more that this Government cannot govern in a time of **crisis**.

* We have proved over the years that Labour can govern, and it has always been the responsibility of Labour to govern in a **crisis**.

* I want to say again that I believe, unfortunately, that a **crisis** is approaching, and that clouds are gathering in Australia.

* This Government is incompetent to deal with a **crisis**.

* Over the weekend and yesterday, the newspapers indicated that those Cabinet meetings were being held in order to deal with a **crisis** that is approaching in Australia.

* How did the Cabinet deal with the **crisis**?

* That is the Government's approach to a **crisis** towards which, as the press has told us, Australia is now heading.

* It has stated that, in this **crisis**, it will restrict hire-purchase finance.

* As I have already stated, this Government proposes to deal with the **crisis** by adopting the very same method that was used during the last depression.

* We are facing a national **crisis** and the country must be geared to meet it.

* The recent honour bestowed on the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  in connexion with the negotiations over the Suez **crisis** provides a further acknowledgment of the statesmanship for which he is held in such high regard among the free nations.

* But it must not be forgotten that Britain exercised the right of veto on the occasion of the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* Let me remind those in this Parliament who believe it is unfortunate that Government and Opposition members differ about the Middle East **crisis** that from the outbreak of the trouble with which the world is now concerned, right up to the present moment, the members of.

* speeches and by printed word have consistently and1 forthrightly advocated the holding of summit talks and the handling of this dangerous' situation by the United 
First, I quote an article that appeared in the Melbourne " Age " of 14th December, 1956, at the time of the Suez **crisis**.

* That was not on the occasion of the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* It is because it believes there is a most serious **crisis** in housing which strikes at the very foundations of our community.

* The Opposition believes that the serious **crisis** in housing has occurred because insufficient homes have been built in Australia.

* The **crisis** has resulted, among other things, in a wrecking of the immigration programme and a breaking-up of the support for immigration throughout Australia.

* Reference to immigration statistics will show that, and I propose to cite the relevant figures, because this is a consequence of the housing **crisis** and associated causes.

* It is a consequence of the causes that have created the housing **crisis**.

* That **crisis** is not new or recent.

* The Government's view that there is no housing **crisis** is founded on that report, and if there is anything wrong with the report, there is something wrong with the Government's attitude.

* There are 22,000 fewer houses under construction than in 1951-52, yet this Government says that there is no housing **crisis**!

* Is that the kind of situation he says does not represent a housing **crisis**?

* Immediately attention is paid to figures such as those I have cited it will be seen that ample room exists for increased taxation and the kind of mal-distribution of income that is behind the housing **crisis** and every other **crisis** becomes apparent.

* He presided over the House in difficult times, times of **crisis**, and his coolness and courtesy made him an admirable  chairman  of the important deliberations of this House.

* What happens eventually is that they plan from one **crisis** to another.

* He described the position by saying, " The threatening **crisis** demands bold measures".

* I shall not go into the industrial causes of the **crisis**.

* I shall quote from the hoard's report on that subject - 
The Farmers Debt Adjustment Board contended that 75 per cent, of Victoria's 1,300 wheatgrowers were then facing a financial **crisis**.

* Every budget and every measure that this Government has brought in to defeat inflation in times of great **crisis** - it has been brave enough to introduce many unpopular measures - has been met with a scream of woe and havoc, but always the Government has been proved right.

* That was a time of great national **crisis**, when an organization declared war on the Labour government.

* I repeat that even in the most acute **crisis** of war, when this country was under the threat of immediate invasion, persons with Japanese, German and Italian associations who had been arrested or detained were enabled to present their cases to boards so that their loyalty could be investigated and, if necessary, a report made recommending their immediate release.

* Australia that this hill should he made a major issue while the economic **crisis** now facing the country is not even tackled.

* The stage has been reached at which Australia is entering a most acute financial and economic **crisis**, with costs rising higher and higher.

* If it will not do so then I say that it is not really interested in the suppression of the Communist party but wishes to use the bill merely to conceal the fact that the nation is entering a financial and economic **crisis**, and that the Government does not know what to do about it.

* The situation could have been met by a surrender to despair, by a catastrophic reduction in expenditure and the precipitation of a **crisis**, if the Government had listened to the demands for tax cuts and even tax eliminations, that would have brought to an end the most spectacular period of progress we have ever known.

* At the moment, and so long as there is no world **crisis**, we are the masters of our own economic fate.

* During the Quemoy  (Kinmen)  **crisis**, many were our friends throughout the Far East who privately counselled standing firm in the face of force.

* The party of which he is a member commanded a majority in both Houses of the Parliament, not for just a few years, but for a long period until the Labour party took over the reins of government in October, 1941, not because it had been voted to power at a general election, but because the anti-Labour Government - the team of misfits to which the Minister then belonged - fell to pieces and proved that it could not govern the nation in a **crisis**.

* We have to keep in mind that this international **crisis** has existed for many weeks.

* But it was decided to interrupt these " man-to-man " talks, and he was given the opportunity on this particular evening, with the co-operation of other commercial radio stations, to make his first statement with regard to the Middle East **crisis**.

* The very last thing the Government wants to publicize is the viewpoint of the Opposition with regard to this **crisis**.

* They made similar statements with regard to the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* The Minister for External Affairs has told us that there is no oil in Lebanon or Jordan, and that therefore, the oil question could not be involved in the present **crisis**; but does any one suggest that if there had not been a forcible overthrow of the Government in Iraq there would have been any British or American troop movements into Lebanon or Jordan?

* Unless Great Britain, the United States of America and France can give more consolidated leadership than they have given in this last **crisis** in the Middle East or in the Suez **crisis** they will allow the forces of communism, which are not answerable to anybody, to capitalize on their failure to unite the free peoples in a common policy.

* Mr. Bruce said the poultry industry in this Stale was going through an economic **crisis** and producers were going out of business " by the dozen ".

* Does the Government deny - as it denied early last year that there was a housing **crisis**, at a time when the Opposition was asserting that there was a housing **crisis** - that there is no employment **crisis** in Australia at the moment, that unemployment is not increasing rapidly and has now reached a figure of 75,000 registered unemployed?

* If there is one thing you can rely on the present Federal Government for when any sort of real **crisis** approaches, it is complete and absolute inertia.

* Evidently the party recognized that there was a housing **crisis** then.

* Everybody remembers how last year he ridiculed the claim made by the Labour party that there was a **crisis** in connexion with housing, and that housing had become a great social problem.

* No honorable member opposite should refer to these concessions as trifling, for had they not been granted I am certain that the need for each one of them would have assumed in the Opposition's budget criticisms the magnitude of a major **crisis**.

* If in a time of **crisis** certain interests have to be thrown overboard to lighten the load, those which are located beyond Singapore must bc the first for sacrifice- 
In regard to the allocation of television licences, we have been told that Labour receives little publicity, and that because newspaper interests have been allotted commercial television licences the Labour party will not be able to have its policy placed before the people through this new medium.

* Honorable members should consider the way in which the press attacked the Government during the economic **crisis** of 1951-52, in order to realize how the job of government was made difficult at that time.

* .- The old colonialism story, and the old exploitation story, that have come from the honorable member for Phillip  (Mr. Fitzgerald)  simply add to the mass of illinformed comment that has come from the Labour party during this debate, much of which has been anti-British iu tone, and is bound up in isolationism of the worst type which bodes the gravest possible ill for this country if we should have the misfortune to have a Labour government in office in an international **crisis**.

* We realized that the Parliament had not been progressively informed of a developing **crisis** and suddenly we found the need to spend an emergency grant of 20.000,000 on education in a very short time.

* We had to find 20,000,000, although the **crisis** had been developing progressively over a period of ten years, and no worthwhile reports had been made available by the Government.

* The Parliament had not been made aware of the magnitude of the **crisis**, and even the Prime Minister was shocked out of his complacency and his lethargy.

* If we can side-step them now we could have sidestepped them long ago and avoided the great **crisis** which developed in education.

* Therefore, this Government stands condemned because, as I have said, this **crisis** has developed menacingly over ten long years during which the Liberal Government has stood immovable like the Sphinx and absolutely useless in its attitude to this matter.

* There is a **crisis** throughout Australia in education, and I want to mention several facts which will tend to substantiate this view.

* That one major factor in the education **crisis** is the impact of the Commonwealth Government's migration policy.

* Is the Royal Australian Navy experiencing a **crisis** in respect of man-power and morale?

* If so, did this invitation arise from his recent statement that there was no **crisis** in the building industry?

* This is a social **crisis** of the first magnitude.

* The Federal Government seems to have become befuddled and paralysed by the financial **crisis** and just does not know what to do.

* If the Government does not know the difference between essential and mushroom industry what confidence can the people of Australia have in its capacity to deal with the grave economic **crisis** that has developed.

* It stumbles from one **crisis**- to another, as with its- policy of import restrictions in 1952.

* In highly educated people we have an asset which could make the nation in time of **crisis**.

* We have seen this condition exist in various times of **crisis**.

* We have a regular army which, I believe, will reach a state of **crisis** this year.

* A **crisis** will arise because the Australian Regular Army will not be able to meet its commitments.

* I believe that a time of **crisis** has arrived.

* The Melbourne " Age ", on 10th November, 1952, published an article under these captions, " Education now a ' grave **crisis** '.

* The article opened with this paragraph - 
Education in Victoria, grossly overburdened and completely out of control, encompassed so many evils that it had become a **crisis** of the gravest urgency, the Dean of the Faculty of Education in Melbourne University (Professor G. S. Browne) said last night.

* In December, 1956, a letter appeared in the " Sydney Morning Herald " written by Professor J. F. D. Wood, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, New South Wales University of Technology, warning of a **crisis** in technical education.

* In the Melbourne "Age" of 18th June, 1956, an article appeared under the heading, " Warning of technical education ' **crisis** ' ".

* But it is in the States, during the stages leading up to university education, where the **crisis** occurs.

* That is not a very real fear because in such a **crisis** we are well aware that help would be forthcoming, and indeed under clause 5* of Part 1. of the Financial Agreement, the States have a power unrestricted by the Commonwealth of borrowing for temporary purposes from certain institutions which operate within State boundaries.

* Such meetings would, also, permit constant consideration of the principal problems dividing the world, and often permit corrective action before the **crisis** became acute.

* The Suez Canal **crisis** of 1956- 
A Labour government came to the conclusion - a conclusion that it publicized by public statements and advertisements throughout the length and breadth of Australia - that the general coal strike was Communist-inspired and directed, and that it was a treacherous strike.

* They sought no part in that struggle and they had no desire to act in that way against fellow Australians, but they were asked by the government of their own country, in a **crisis** that had been stigmatized as Communistinspired, to assist in maintaining essential services.

* I say that the honorable gentleman slandered a body of his fellow Australians when he said that, if a Labour government, in a **crisis** of that kind, had appealed to the members of the Australian Workers Union to help it to maintain essential services, they would have rejected the request.

* Its hesitancy in facing up to problems confronting us is so marked that one wonders whether the expert advisers and planners with which this Government surrounds itself have the ability to gauge the immensity of the **crisis** with which we are now faced.

* We recently found that out in connexion with the so-called Suez Canal **crisis**.

* The disclosures made by this gentleman sent a shudder through the people of Australia who had accepted the glib assurances of our Prime Minister and the service Ministers that Australia would be at full strength should a **crisis** develop.

* The **crisis** that we are facing is rendered more acute by two factors with which we can deal in this Parliament and which I hope will be discussed before this debate concludes.

* When one examines these budgets, which really must be considered side by side, one should ask whether they will assist competitive production enough, because, ultimately, the matter of the settlement of the balance of payments will be largely determined by that issue, and whether they will bring us through this **crisis**, not merely quickly, but permanently.

* The inquiry sought to ascertain how best the nation could be equipped to deal with any future **crisis** necessitating greater technical efficiency.

* A year ago, the Leader of the Opposition  (Dr. Evatt)  described the unemployment situation as a **crisis**.

* No wonder he has shifted from the position taken up by the Leader of the Opposition a year ago when he described the unemployment situation as a **crisis**.

* I said that is the cause of the whole Middle East **crisis**.

* I have always claimed that the Minister for External Affairs would stick up for the United Nations and at the time of the Suez **crisis** I felt that he was in favour of the United Nations' actions and that he differed very strongly from the course followed by this Government.

* I have before me a copy of a report prepared by the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee, entitled The Crisis in the Finances and Development of the Australian Universities.

* The universities will have to examine their responsibilities also, because the present **crisis** in university finances has been developing over the past twenty years.

* requests the Prime Minister to call an all-party conference representing all State parliaments to meet with the Commonwealth representatives to discuss the educational **crisis**.

* I am afraid that the **crisis** is upon us.

* This **crisis** will be solved by the ordinary people - the farmer, the worker and the man in the street.

* This country faces an impending food **crisis** and other grave national problems that call for disinterested self-sacrifice from all sections of the community.

* I shall quote to honorable members from the book,  Caucus Crisis,  by Warren Denning.

* He has a balance of payments **crisis** every year or two.

* In his absence, the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  came along and said, " An international **crisis** is coming.

* After the **crisis** of 1951-52, imports fell away to a low figure, partly through import restrictions, partly because stocks had been built up, and partly through a slackening of internal demand.

* I wish to bring again to the notice of the House some salient facts about the financial **crisis** in the Australian dried fruits industry.

* Let me say, first of all, that the **crisis** in the industry has been brought about by rising costs of production and the slow sale of fruit in the United Kingdom.

* In presenting this bill to the Parliament, they have tacitly admitted that  a  policy of  laisser-faire  is a failure at a time of pretended or real **crisis**.

* Throughout the world, whenever a **crisis** comes upon a country, private enterprise has to be brought under government controls, and socialism has to take over.

* The plea has been made, and I want to repeat it in this House on behalf of professional educators, that the Commonwealth should take the initiative in conducting a nation-wide inquiry to find out the needs of primary, secondary and technical education in Australia, and that, in the interim, as an emergency measure, the Commonwealth should provide urgently needed aid for the States with a view to overcoming the **crisis**, as it has been truly called, in education.

* Those who belong to one school are content that the **crisis** is past, and that the private banks will not be nationalized.

* On a population basis, the rate of construction of houses in Australia in the last seven years has been greater, I think, than in any other free country in the world, but of course, now the Labour party, driven almost daft by its troubles, casting around, has seized hold of some false claim that there is a **crisis** - because it is a false claim - and is now seeking to make itself the friend of the people whom, on his showing, the honorable member for East Sydney must have deserted for the whole of the eight years that Labour was in office.

* On the other hand, it would be much better if we paid very much more attention to the A.T.C., or Australia's transport **crisis**.

* I would recommend, to those honorable members who are interested, two volumes, one which is obtainable in the Library, entitled " Australia's Transport Crisis ", which is a series of addresses given by transport experts at the twenty-second Summer School of the Institute of Political Science in Canberra, in January of this year, and the other the Australian Transport Advisory Council's publication in October of last year, entitled, " The Costs of Transport Operation in Australia ".

* He went on to say - 
The **crisis** that exists in New South Wales as a result of the failure of the wheat crop has been made clear by the honorable member for Parkes  (Mr. Haylen).

* This Parliament controls the purse-strings of the nation, and it must provide financial assistance to any State in which a **crisis** of this kind occurs, because the allocation of finance to the States is tailored to measure a year ahead and no provision is made for the States to meet catastrophes such as drought, flood and fire.

* The Government's refusal to provide 5,000,000 at the request of the New South Wales Government to meet this **crisis** will cause inflation.

* Am I to understand that, in time of **crisis**, telephone exchanges, aerodromes, and wharfs are not to be safeguarded and watched over?

* Let me say that if the public feels that a government can vote to reduce parliamentary salaries and allowances in time of **crisis**, then it should give this Government credit for knowing the facts of the situation when it says that the economy can stand these increases.

* As I said, I voted on one occasion against a rise in parliamentary salaries; I voted on another occasion to reduce them, and again, in a time of **crisis**, I voted for a 22^ per cent, reduction.

* The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  (Mr. McEwen)  and the honorable member for Robertson  (Mr. Dean)  have mentioned some very important and significant facts about this Government's achievements, as a result of the economic policy that it has applied, They are worth repeating, because they prove that the Government courageously set about stabilizing the economy of Australia, despite **crisis** after **crisis**.

* suggest that the Government is putting itself on the side of those who believe in compulsion, just as did other governments, in times of economic **crisis**, with the intention, whether they recognize it or not, of imposing authority upon the Labour movement in order to advance the interests of employers and businessmen.

* If the Government has not introduced this legislation for the reasons that I have stated earlier, I ask the Minister whether it has done so because of an economic **crisis** upon which we may now be entering.

* Tanker freight rates are currently lower than rates being charged immediately prior to the Suez **crisis**.

* He then went on to admit that he had stated to that gathering that there was no **crisis** in housing in Australia.

* They advised the committee, and the people of this country, that a **crisis** does exist, first in respect of the lack of homes for the people, and secondly because of the effect that the failure of the Government to deal with the housing shortage is having upon industry.

* But is it not ridiculous that although a housing **crisis** exists and thousands of our own people and new arrivals are living under intolerable conditions, this Government continues to bring to Australia approximately 2,500 additional settlers every week?

* We agree with the Minister for the Interior that we are facing a national **crisis**.

* It is, in fact, possibly a world **crisis**, because we all accept, as a fact, the division of the world to-day into two clearly denned political spheres.

* When the Suez **crisis** arose, the Minister for the Army  (Mr. Cramer)  said that we could send 2.000, 3,000 or 4,000 men to that area.

* In time of **crisis** we shall find it necessary to purchase our aircraft abroad.

* The British Labour party from the beginning has exercised commendable restraint, and officially,  Mr. Gaitskell  and  Mr. Bevan  have done nothing which would compromise the unity of the British people in this **crisis**.

* They realize that where international peace and security are involved, it is particularly important for them to be sure of their ground before taking steps to impede the actions of the United States and the United Kingdom which, after all, were the great Powers responsible for handling the **crisis** and the Powers which bore the responsibility.

* Opposition  (Dr. Evatt)  when this **crisis** blew up, a statement made in the strongest condemnatory terms of the British and French action, at a time when he could not possibly have been sure of the facts and when he must have known that his statement would divide the Australian people and thus reduce the effectiveness of any action which the Australian Government subsequently might be able to take.

* Most honorable members on this side of the House have received deputations in recent weeks on the subject of the Middle East **crisis**, deputations organized and led by Communists but including among their members a majority of good, decent Australians who were encouraged to join the deputations by the statements of the Leader of the Opposition and the arguments used by him.

* The tragedy is that what, three or four years ago was a simple matter capable of being solved by the means adopted by the British Labour Government in relation to India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma, ha1* developed into a great international **crisis** with a line-up of opposing powers and an undoubted threat of world war.

* The Prime Minister has told us that the Australian Government did not assume  n  passive role in the Indo-China **crisis**.

* The Minister asked whether the Leader of the Opposition knew that there was a grave world-wide recession in prices for primary products and that, as a result, a **crisis** confronted the Australian farmer.

* The Budget contains not the slightest indication that the Government proposes to assist the primary industries during this period of **crisis**.

* There is no vision in a government which stands idly by while the farming industries, which are the basis of Australia's prosperity, struggle against a severe **crisis**.

* He is making a great complaint that there could be, or there would be, delay in the upward adjustment of reserve deposits in the event of a financial **crisis**.

* But for the almost reckless manner in which the Government allowed the private banks to draw on special accounts and provide almost unlimited money for their importer customers the import **crisis** would not have occurred or it would have been comparatively minor in character.

* Seeing the situation that was developing at that time and the rapid increase that was taking place in overseas funds,  Mr. Chifley  watched the matter very carefully and avoided a **crisis**.

* It is part and parcel of a deliberate plan to bring industrial **crisis** to Australia, to exacerbate the injustices that may exist, and to try to weaken Australia's economy.

* Once again I point to the fact that the activities of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation are calculated to fit into a plan to bring about in this country **crisis** after **crisis**, and so to weaken the economy that the ultimate Communist objective can be achieved.

* During a recess, a great international **crisis** may arise, or there may be internal economic stress.

* Each time that it has to make a decision of that kind, there is something in the nature of an internal **crisis**.

* The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that the Opposition is playing a political game in a time of **crisis**.

* This Government has created its own **crisis**.

* That was at the time of the great Berlin **crisis**, when matters were very delicate.

* We should not adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Darebin  (Mr. Andrews)  and wait until the **crisis** is upon ais.

* He said that the basic economic issue underlying the whole of the Middle East situation, including the Suez **crisis**, was the struggle of the world monopolies to control oil supplies.

* A little later he said that is the cause of the whole Middle East **crisis**.

* If we are going to speak of aggression and the United Nations, let us recognize the further fact that had it not been for the military action of Great Britain and France, there would have been no action, effective or ineffective, by the United Nations in the Middle East **crisis** at all.

* I say that there is a **crisis** in the housing industry.

* But the real **crisis**, as I see it, is this: I know from my industrial knowledge, gained before my entry into politics, that the first evidence of a recession in any country is a slump in the building industry.

* Why is it that every time a **crisis** of this character develops in Australia, Government supporters and spokesmen, particularly Ministers and the Prime Minister, are quick to deny that a **crisis** exists and are always too late in controlling its effects?

* We had a **crisis** in the mining industry about twelve or eighteen months ago.

* Although it became apparent to almost everybody that a **crisis** existed, the Minister for National Development  (Senator Spooner)  told us that there was no **crisis** in the mining industry.

* Weeks went by, and it became quite obvious that a **crisis** did exist, as a result of which radical changes and transformations have taken place in the mining industry.

* I remind honorable members of the Government's attitude towards the housing **crisis**.

* I do not think any one will ever forget the classic statement of the Prime Minister that there was no **crisis** in housing.

* I think his statement that there was no housing **crisis** is on a par with his promise to put value back into the 1.

* A few weeks ago  Senator Spooner  told us that there was no **crisis** in unemployment.

* Let no Government supporter try to convince us that that money will be used to ease the housing **crisis**.

* It related to legislation designed to deal with the most desperate **crisis** that had ever occurred within living memory in Australia, and, in fact, in the world - the depression.

* Many Ministers have indicated that they do nol believe that there is  a  housing **crisis** in Australia.

* The Prime Minister has indicated that he does not believe that there is a housing **crisis**.

* His  serenity and his judgment in **crisis**, and his influence for good were such that he will go down in history as one of the great world leaders of his day.

* Though there will be inconveniences and some individual hardships, there is no reaSon why we should not readily surmount thi*  particular  **crisis**.

* In to-day's issue of the Melbourne  Herald  under the heading "Malayan Threat at Worst Peak" a message from Kuala Lumpur states that the Communist **crisis** in Malaya is more dangerous than it was before the British Army had been called in.

* The honorable member for Lowe quoted a statement that was made by the late John Curtin at a time of grave **crisis** for Australia.

* "With respect, I submit that it was unbecoming of the honorable gentleman to repeat such a statement in this House at this time of **crisis**.

* In view of the statement made on Tuesday night last by the right honorable gentleman on the Suez **crisis**, in the course of which he said that it might be necessary to apply- 
The honorable member also said, in effect, that Australians are different from the men of older countries.

* I do not concede that because the Australian has proved himself to be a man of great courage and initiative it is not necessary to train him to meet a **crisis** when it arises.

* The Treasurer complimented the Leader of the Opposition, in my presence, for the manner in which he was able to exercise restraint upon the Opposition side when he was apprised of all the facts of the Suez **crisis**.

* He and I are entitled to our own opinions on the Suez **crisis**, and we are entitled to our opinions as to the difference of opinion between the Treasurer, the Minister for External Affairs, and the Prime Minister on this question.

* A government cannot be judged merely by the fact that a **crisis** has occurred.

* It must be judged by the action it takes when the **crisis** arises, because we know that, by the natural law of consequences, crises must occur.

* A **crisis** occurred in 1951 when there was a sudden decline of the price of wool.

* The alternative to what Labour proposes is not only the present Government; it is inflation, **crisis**, and depression.

* In the past, in moments of **crisis** we have asked for confidence to be placed in us, and we ask for it again.

* It was this opposition, associated with the increase of unemployment in 1952-53  -  that **crisis** which was associated with the clamping down of import controls for the first time, when thousands of migrants were walking streets of the capital cities, such as Melbourne, looking for work - that compelled the Government to reduce its migration programme, so that the figures that I have quoted fell from 11,045 per month to 8,746, then to 5,274, and then to 4,282.

* The Suez Canal **crisis** also has affected the flow of imports, but, as a result of the settling of the **crisis**, that situation will be overcome in the near future.

* If the Suez Canal **crisis** is only half as serious as the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  has indicated in press statements that he believes it to be, then we ought not to be thinking of television, at least until we have done something for the soldiers of this country and for the increasing population of this country in respect of the primary needs for houses, schools, hospitals and the things that are essential to our well-being and national greatness.

* No more was heard about the **crisis** over Thailand, and the imminence of war, until the Minister for Commerce  (Sir Earle Page)  repeated last Monday - 
Modern warfare has made the heart of the British world tremendously vulnerable.

* Must we await a major **crisis** of peace before we show the imagination, courage and enterprise, not merely to develop a vision of Commonwealth, but to do something effective about the great inheritance which has come to us?

* I have always maintained that no government, irrespective of its political colour, could carry on without serious disruption of its economy while the dollar **crisis** lasted.

* During the economic **crisis** of the thirties, the proportion of unemployed workers in Australia rose as high as 33 per cent., and Professor Copland expressed the opinion that, after the depression had ended, we would always have 10 per cent, of our people unemployed.

* If the present intolerable industrial conditions are allowed to continue a **crisis** will descend upon us and we shall remain in that state until we are removed from it by somebody else or until we clamber out of it, perhaps leaving the honorable member for Watson behind.

* Even if that fails, I am still not without hope that out of their own **crisis** and out of their own' desperation the relatively fittest members of our community will take charge of the situation and will take measures to rectify the position.

* Further, unemployment in Tasmania and the housing **crisis** are as serious, in proportion, as they are in other States.

* In view of Tasmania's very real need, will the Treasurer genuinely consider making a special direct grant to that State of at least 500,000, such as has been made to other States when a special **crisis** has developed?

* In France, General de Gaulle's rise to power was brought about by the Algerian **crisis**; but the necessity and the reason for his overwhelming support was the chaotic value of the franc, with all its related confusion and misery.

* Britain arrived at that **crisis** which had to be met.

* The Government boosted the rate by 2 per cent, to its present level last September to fend off a **crisis** in which the pound sterling was in " peril ".

* I should like to conclude  my  speech  by  paying a tribute to one figure who emerges as a great world leader  in  this great **crisis**, a gentleman whose courage, persistence and ability have been underestimated  by  too many.

* Cabinet Ministers also have expressed the view that Australia is facing a grave **crisis**.

* The honorable member for Corio says that there is no need for gloom or despair, but in the last few days the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  has been closeted with the bankers of this country in order to find out what they are prepared to do to assist his Government in the present **crisis**.

* One source of the strength of a democracy is its ability to distinguish between times of national **crisis** and times when ordinary democratic freedom may be allowed to operate.

* That elasticity has preserved in Great Britain the idea that in times of **crisis** the country will take very strong action which would he regarded in normal times as being tyrannical and that when normal times return the country will revert to the ordinary rule of law.

* There can be no doubt that at present we are confronted with a world **crisis** and that the times are insecure.

* In other words, we are confronted with a **crisis** and action must be taken to defend the democratic system of government in which we believe.

* In times of **crisis** it has been the habit of British countries and countries that have adopted the principles of British justice and democracy to suspend the ordinary rights of the individual in order to ensure that in the long run those rights shall be preserved.

* It is only logical that the least step that can be taken in the interests of national security, if we admit that there is a **crisis** to-day, is to remove Communists from the Public Service and from positions in which they are likely to do harm to national security before they actually do it.

* It would appear, therefore, that we must concentrate upon impressing upon honorable members opposite that there is a **crisis** in the world, that there is a danger to Australia from communism and that Communists inside Australia are working for the destruction of this country in obedience to orders from Communist Russia.

* Regardless of the present **crisis**, all honorable members would think that, as a necessary part of the defence of the country, this Parliament should have power to deal with any hostile threat.

* **crisis** with which this legislation is intended to deal.

* At the time of the Suez Canal **crisis**, the Brisbane " Courier-Mail " severely criticized the action taken by the United Kingdom and France.

* He intervened on behalf of the Greek Communist murderers who were due to be executed, but he did not intervene on behalf of the Polish socialists who were murdered by Stalin behind the Iron Curtain, lt will be recalled that he was concerned with the appeasement of Russia in the 1948 Berlin **crisis**.

* I shall read some comments upon that **crisis** by  Mr. W.  H. Chamberlin, one of the foremost authorities in the United States on international affairs.

* He said - 
In a time of political **crisis** if we had a middleclass party, a conservative party, a Liberal party, an Australian Labour party, and other political parties, some fragmentary section of the people might secure representation.

* The Government could have decided, logically, that the wool stores owned by the Joint Organization should be retained, in the present days of tension, in the interests of wool-growers against the contingency of their being needed again in a **crisis**.

* In view of the warning of the international **crisis** in the Middle.

* Can he inform the House whether the destroyer " Arunta " is to be put away in mothballs and refitting work on this modern destroyer discontinued despite the Middle East **crisis**?

* The Government can blame only it:eli for having failed to attempt to deal with the economic **crisis** that now exists because rectification of all our economic ills rests in its hands under the measures to which I have referred.

* It was summoned by the Government to enable it to pass the buck and thus escape criticism of its own inaction in the face of the economic **crisis** that confronted the nation.

* The Government is incapable of governing the country in this period of economic **crisis** just as an earlier government of similar complexion and with the same leader was incapable of governing it when we were facing the prospect of war against Japan ten years ago.

* Honorable members will recall that on that occasion the present Prime Minister, who was then Prime Minister of this country, walked out of office, not because he was compelled by the people to do so, but because of his incompetency to guide Australia through what proved to be the greatest **crisis** in its history.

* A similar negative policy has been adopted by the present Government in the face of the existing economic **crisis**.

* Did he receive a telegram from the Building Industry Congress contesting his claim that no **crisis** existed in the home-building industry and offering to send representatives to Canberra to place evidence before him to prove just how desperate the position is really becoming?

* Prom press reports that were published at the time, it appeared that a great **crisis** had developed in the course of the conference, and severe criticism of the United Kingdom delegation was attributed to some representatives of other countries.

* That **crisis** ' lasted only for 24 hours, and agreement was reached in the end.

* Unfortunately, the Suez **crisis** and the dispute between Egypt and Israel are only two of the many serious problems that have confronted the world during the last 200 years.

* In addressing a question to the Acting Prime Minister,  I  refer to the decision announced six months ago to appoint a committee of inquiry into the urgent problem created by the **crisis** in the dairy industry.

* Has the committee, indeed, yet been appointed; or did the urgency of the **crisis** disappear with the election results?

* the  cause of this **crisis**, and until the **crisis** is resolved - and it can only be resolved by the valiant efforts of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and as a result of a complete understanding In the community of the true position - these wretched discussions will continue  ad infinitum.

* The honorable member for Batman referred to the fact that hospitals are living from **crisis** to **crisis** and leading a handtomouth existence.

* There is a  Teal  **crisis** in education.

* I will illustrate just how grave this **crisis** can become and is becoming to the nation.

* Two years ago spectacular measures were necessary to meet a balance of payments **crisis** - a **crisis** that arose because the value of imports greatly exceeded the value of exports.

* Australia should place itself in the position of being able to meet a similar **crisis** with the export remedy.

* Ability to meet a similar **crisis** in this more acceptable way depends upon ability to cut costs.

* I shall refer to what is recognized as the real **crisis** in the nation at present, which is our balance of trade position.

* If we had reserved that 600.000,000 in 1952, and added it to the 400,000,000 that we now have in credit, we would not have an overseas balance **crisis** at the moment.

* The late  Mr. John  Curtin became Prime Minister in October, 1941, when Australia was facing probably the gravest **crisis** in its history.

* As the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr. Casey)  said this afternoon, and as we know from our study of newspapers during the past months, ever since the Suez **crisis** occurred and  President  Nasser obtained influence among the Arab nations, he has used propaganda and bribery in an effort to subvert the controlling powers or governments of various countries in the Middle East.

* I feel a great deal of apprehension for Turkey in this **crisis**.

* We have to bear in mind that Australia might well be faced with such a **crisis** in the not distant future.

* It could be that this situation in the Middle East will be exploited by the Chinese Communists, because the tactics of the Communists in the past have been to move points of **crisis** from one place to another - from Europe to Asia, from Asia to the Middle East and then back to Europe.

* Of course, the co url has had to cope with the situation existing in times of financial **crisis**, in times of peace, and in times of war, and it has had to do the best it could do as a body of practical men.

* The Suez **crisis** has also had some influence on the rate at which imports have arrived.

* At a time when an economic **crisis**, a3 it was called, occurred, this Government taxed luxury goods such as fur coats, but as soon as the waves of recession or depression, or whatever it might be called, receded, the tax, not on the basic items, but on luxury goods, was reduced.

* We speak of the housing **crisis**.

* .- I want to raise for the attention of the House tonight a very urgent and important matter, namely, the **crisis** in Indonesia and recent' developments there.

* Indonesia to-day is in a condition which is nothing more than a continuation of a **crisis** of seven or eight years' duration.

* The only answer of this Government, and of those with which it is associated, to this **crisis**, is to supply arms to Indonesia.

* It consists of waiting to take action until there is some **crisis** or disturbance.

* I say that the problem in Indonesia is one of economic instability, and unless that is dealt with, there will continue to be a **crisis** and problem of the nature that exists at present.

* Are we to see develop a **crisis** of that sort, which can be met in the end only by military occupation?

* this **crisis** as, it has done in.

* Why did not the one-man controlled Commonwealth Bank of that period, under  Sir Denison  Miller, do something to avert the **crisis**?

* A major catastrophe was averted by an over-night change of financial policy in the United States of America that was reflected throughout the world, just as the dollar **crisis** to-day affects the economy of the entire world.

* The action then taken to enable the bank to reconstitute its management saved the bank from serious embarrassment, and saved the people of this country from even greater embarrassment, in the **crisis** of World War II.

* The principal argument advanced by Opposition members against this measure is based on the erroneous belief that under one man control, the Commonwealth Bank can make limitless millions of pounds available in time of **crisis**, whereas, under the control of a board, that cannot be done.

* How then do honorable members opposite sustain their argument that a one-man controlled bank can make available limitless credit in time of national **crisis**?

* If so, is he in a position to give particulars of them now, and can he also state in what way further overseas loans will affect Australia's serious adverse trade balance of 256,000,000 as shown in the figures for the financial year 1954-55, which is, in effect, the cause of the approaching economic storm and one of the reasons why the Prime Minister is rushing on the general elections in order to avoid the **crisis** which will probably arrive about next May?

* Over the last few weeks and months it has been obscured, possibly, by the amount of publicity that has been given to the Suez Canal **crisis**; but even now, in parts of South-East Asia, the Seato forces are doing their job of containing the inarch of communism southward from red China.

* .- It is rather interesting to note that the honorable member for St. George  (Mr. Graham)  devoted just on two and a half minutes of his time to dealing with the economic **crisis**.

* I refer to the present economic **crisis**, and the pending depression.

* At least, we can say that neither the honorable member for St. George nor any other honorable member on the Government side has followed his usual practice of blaming the Communists for the present economic **crisis**.

* Listening to the twenty minutes of eloquence and headlines that he gave to ns, I think that any person would have had some difficulty in realizing until  the  last five minutes, that the subject with which he was dealing was an economic **crisis** in the Australian nation.

* What did he put forward as a suggestion from the Labour benches as to what should be done in this **crisis**?

* Then came the even greater **crisis** of World War II.

* We shall always associate his trimfigure in Air Force uniform with the **crisis** of World War II.

* At the same time, this Government i3 endeavouring to meet the present economic **crisis** by living within its revenue.

* The Leader of the Opposition complained of the failure of the Commonwealth Bank Board during the financial and economic **crisis** in the early 1930's.

* There was no real understanding on the part of any body in this country - and, judging by the advice that we received at that time from overseas, in any other country - of the real nature of the economic **crisis** that was then affecting the world.

* The New South Wales Government with which I was subsequently connected between 1932 and 1941, more and more appreciated the factors that were really operating and that could be used to mitigate the effects of that **crisis**.

* We saw the total collapse of a Labour government in New South Wales that went down in  wallow of debt and unemployment such as we had never seen before, and we saw our own Government gradually pull New South Wales out of the **crisis**.

* 1 do not claim the credit for that fact, but I do say that when a right, honorable gentleman rises in this House and derides the point of view adopted by other  nien  at that particular time because they did not understand the **crisis** al first, he hardly assists the present argument to any sensible conclusion.

* There cannot be a shadow of doubt that in recent months, as **crisis** after **crisis** - domestic and international - piled Pelion on Ossa, the Cabinet in Canberra has been quite unable to exercise any collective control over the ministry and over the several departments.

* On the other hand, any fair-minded motorist who is also a loyal citizen, a family man and a general taxpayer would resent the spending of money on roads at a time when it was more important to spend it on schools, on hospitals or on housing - about which Opposition supporters so frequently tell us - and even, in time of **crisis**, on defence.

* Having said this, I would like to say to such people in other nations as may be willing to listen, that there are three aspects of the present Middle East **crisis** which deserve the urgent and earnest consideration of all men.

* But the whole history of this century is so full of friendship between our two peoples, and the whole outlook of the United States has been compounded of such generosity and understanding, that I believe that the more the position adopted by Great Britain on this **crisis** is understood by our American friends, the more they will come to understand that what has been sought is not war, but the averting of war; not aggression, but the effective settlement of disputes which could, if left to work themselves out, involve all the peace-loving people of the world in the kind of conflict which they all hope honorably to avoid.

* Throughout the history of democracy, the democracy that was founded in the United Kingdom, in times of **crisis** the government has become a national government, and the leaders of it have brought to the service of the country all their ability and brains.

* It would be quite stupid to say that there are not honorable members opposite who have brains and ability, but in times of **crisis** they refuse, on party political lines, to give the benefit of their brains and their ability to the country in the way that they should.

* The Opposition does not say that any one of the proposals that it has advanced would of itself constitute a remedy for inflation, but it does say that the onus is upon the Government to explain to the people of Australia the positive action that it proposes to take to deal with the economic **crisis** with which we are faced, and which may result in tragedy and disaster.

* Much more must be done and I can only hope and trust that this Parliament will stimulate the Government, rouse the Ministry from its slumbers, remove its self-satisfaction in regard to these matters, and dispel its belief that there is no **crisis** in the building industry, that there is no shortage of money and that the problem is one of man-power and materials.

* In the last few moments before my time expires, I shall refer to a grave **crisis** in the mining industry.

* The Minister for National Development, whom I describe more aptly as the " Minister for No Development ", has also stated that there is no **crisis** in the mining industry.

* In the view of the Minister, of course, there is no **crisis**, but in the mine fields over the last year or two about 1,900 fewer employees have been engaged.

* It appears to me that this nation may experience a **crisis** in the future.

* In a time of **crisis** it is extremely difficult to train miners and open up mines.

* If the Government is not concerned with its preservation at present, it should at least take into account the fact that it would be extremely valuable in a **crisis**.

* We are attempting by this legislation to deal with- something that is in the nature of a national **crisis**, and I desire again to refer to the fact that when a state of emergency existed in .this country last year the then 
.- When the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr. Casey)  made his statement, which dealt mainly with Asian affairs, he implied that, in the fairly near future, he would be making statements on matters pertaining to other aspects of global affairs.

* In the recent past, we have had statements on Poland, Hungary and the Suez **crisis**.

* We must bear in mind, too, that at the time of the Suez Canal **crisis** America - I am sure my friends of the Opposition will not like this as much - was accused of intervening in the Suez **crisis** to look after her oil interests.

* As British protection for our dried fruits is now almost non-existent, the dried fruits industry is facing its worst **crisis** for twenty years.

* Since canned foods, particularly fruit and vegetables, have to be grown before they can be processed, will the Minister explore the possibility of entering into an arrangement with the British Ministry of Food so that an advance estimate might be made of the quantities of canned foods likely to be required in any one year, to enable producers to plan in advance a production programme to meet the demand, and thus avoid a repetition of the **crisis** of scarcity which preceded the outbreak of World War II.?

* until the production **crisis** lias been mastered.

* Only the Labour party can lead in a **crisis**, whether it be in peace-time or in war-time.

* He is a dangerous man in a **crisis**.

* According to one newspaper he was so much concerned with the Suez **crisis** that he actually turned off the television set in the Daimler car, because he could not concentrate on Australia's problems while he was viewing the test cricket.

* It is perfectly true that he has initiated a debate on the Suez **crisis**, which is now listed on the notice-paper.

* Therefore, a threefold **crisis** exists, shortage of teachers, a tidal wave of students and insatiable demands for school accommodation beyond the resources of the States.

* We are told that an additional 10,000,000 could be used, in New South Wales this financial year in helping to relieve the **crisis** facing secondary education.

* It has clearly indicated that it has no concerted plan and no vision in respect of the **crisis** in the coal industry.

* The honorable member for Petrie  (Mr. Hulme)  changed the theme slightly by saying, since he came from Queensland, that the housing **crisis** was due to the action of the Queensland Government.

* What is our undoubted strength in peace becomes an equally undoubted liability in times of **crisis** which demand the adoption of swift methods to counter the machinations of totalitarian foes.

* An illustration of the Government's desire to convoke Parliament whenever necessary was the speed with which the House was summoned when the Korean **crisis** occurred.

* In times of **crisis** and emergency such as those through which we are undoubtedly passing it is the duty of an opposition to assist in the government of the country.

* If ever there was a **crisis** in housing it was the **crisis** that they faced in the immediate post-war years.

* I do not blame them for that **crisis**.

* It was inevitable that after a war of the magnitude of the one in which we had been engaged there would be a **crisis** in home building.

* If there is a **crisis** to-day, how much more serious was the **crisis** in 1947?

* Therefore, the position seems to be that it is quite impossible to say logically that a housing **crisis** has arisen at this time.

* The universities in Australia are meeting a **crisis** in numbers.

* As honorable members will recall, they met  a  **crisis** in numbers immediately after the war, when the bank-up of persons of normal university age coming out of the services swelled their numbers for a few years after peace was declared.

* is the reason why I have been late in asking the question - from the general secretary of the miner's federation, who has informed me that a **crisis** is developing.

* If not, there will be a **crisis** in the industry.

* Both the Minister and the honorable member have stated that there is no **crisis** in the dairying industry.

* That statement ought to be a sufficient indication that now is the time for the Government or, for that matter, the Parliament to take cognizance of the fact that we may be facing a **crisis** in the dairying industry.

* .- If it is true, as the honorable member for Forrest  (Mr. Freeth)  declares, that immigrants have made a major contribution towards solving the housing shortage, it must be clear that a scarcity of finance, and not of material or labour, has produced our present **crisis**.

* I believe that the housing **crisis** in Australia is far more acute than honorable members realize, and that the shortage of houses throughout Australia is thousands worse than statistics reveal.

* For a policy in a time of **crisis** that just about takes the bun, because two referendums have already been held on that specific matter and the proposals to alter the Constitution were in both instances overwhelmingly rejected by the electors.

* It cannot be emphasized too strongly that preparations for defence must be made before any **crisis** occurs, if they are to be effective.

* Let us remember that these things must be done before the **crisis** occurs, or not at all.

* For example, after the 1892 economic disaster which lasted until 1895, the Australian people manifested in a number of ways the need and desire for a banking system that would free itself from the hazards that precipitated that **crisis**.

* The Leader of the Opposition is horrified at imperialism and colonialism in the Middle East - the imperialism of Great Britain as shown in the Suez **crisis**, and in Cyprus; and the colonialism of France in Algeria!

* Then, we have the resolution that was passed some years ago during (he accidental absence of Russia at the time of the Korean **crisis** - the " combining for peace resolution ".

* Who knows but that the increased price for wool is not the result of the Suez **crisis**, and that if the dispute were satisfactorily resolved the price would fall again?

* Sir Frederick also confirmed that we had been equally as unready in the previous **crisis** in 1953.

* In view of the threatened **crisis** in the Middle East, and also in view of the declaration of  Sir Frederick  Shedden, the former permanent head of the Department of Defence, that Australia's defences were in a hopeless position, will the right honorable gentleman inform the House: First, as to the overall strength of our defence forces; secondly, as to what extent Sydney and the other capital cities of Australia have adequate radar detection equipment; and, thirdly, as to what extent they have an air umbrella defence?

* The import **crisis** was caused by the failure of the Government to ensure that the special accounts were drawn upon only in a prudent manner in the national interest.

* Suppose a **crisis** was developing, and the Government needed to call in a substantial portion of the assets of the banks.

* Because of the turmoil in Indonesia and the rumblings in the Arab states and Persia, it is easy to see that Australia could, almost over-night, be faced with a fuel **crisis** affecting her industries, particularly her transport system.

* So I raise the matter again to-night because I feel that Australia could quite easily face a fuel **crisis** within a very short time.

* Many people, even many of our leaders, are still under the domination of the Russian-sponsored thesis that our present defence policy is sufficient to meet the gathering atomic **crisis**.

* It is a good omen that Churchill is taking with him to Bermuda, his chief atomic adviser, Lord Cherwell, because it may indicate that Great Britain has some realization of the imminence and importance of the atomic **crisis**.

* Apparently, the Prime Minister does not even recognize that a **crisis** exists in the building industry.

* there has been a sudden campaign in some sections of the press and elsewhere designed to convince the people that there is a housing **crisis**.

* a tragic situation, which gives the lie direct to the Prime Minister's contention that there is no **crisis** in the building industry.

* I believe it to be the duty of any government in a real democracy, to consult the Parliament in every time of **crisis**, and particularly at a. time when lives are being risked in warlike action.

* In .view of those utterances, assurances of support for the United Nations in this **crisis** come rather astonishingly from the toughened lips of Government spokesmen.

* Lie  was Foreign Minister of Norway at the time of Norway's greatest **crisis**.

* We acted in perfectly good faith in .1948 during the Berlin **crisis**, which was settled on just terms, and I make no apology for anything that I did as  President  of the General Assembly of the United Nations.

* The inflationary and economic **crisis** is deepening, but the Government has no plan to meet it.

* I agree with those honorable members who expressed regret that it was not called upon to intervene in the **crisis** in IndoChina shortly after the conflict in that country commenced.

* The next **crisis** was the Berlin blockade which was followed by disputes in Palestine and several other countries in the Middle East.

* That is the only reason why we did not reach this **crisis** in our economy some years ago.

* But the Government is quite willing to write into legislation something that will be very public in the event of an economic **crisis** occurring in this country.

* In the annual report of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for 1957 this passage occurs - 
It is good that a United Nations committee is to look for facts about the Laotian **crisis** .

* The reasons can be traced home again and again to this Government, and to those backbenchers who fomented this **crisis**, as we can prove, and forced an unwilling Minister and a most unwilling Prime Minister, at the point of the political sword, to do their bidding.

* It was to be expected that, as this is a moment of **crisis**, which will deepen and worsen as the days go by, the Government would have something positive to put forward.

* To use words from the play  Henry V.,  he may be described, if cut to size, as follows : - 
Sufficient has already been said during the course of this debate to indicate the complete baselessness of the Prime Minister's absurd and cynical assertion that there is no housing **crisis**, but only a shortage of man-power and materials.

* The present housing **crisis** is but one of the many warnings which this Government has received for some time now.

* At this time last year, Australia was faced with an economic **crisis** of a severity paralleled only by the economic **crisis** of the 'thirties.

* In the latter year a Labour Government was in office under the Prime Ministership of  Mr. Scullin,  but it did nothing to meet the economic **crisis** that then engulfed the country.

* Every thinking person in the community is now able to say that Australia has emerged from the **crisis** and can look forward to the future with the greatest confidence.

* Two years ago, there was a **crisis** in Guiana.

* The Colonial Secretary, describing in a white paper the **crisis** which developed, traced it to five people, and ultimately to one person,  Mrs. Jagan,  operating on a situation of poverty among sugar workers.

* Dr. Jagan,  in one of his speeches, showed that he thought on a global scale, and he tried to influence global opinion when he said this in his election speech - 

 Dr. Azikiwe was met by this Nigerian student, who had come to realize that bitterness and hatred were weapons in the hands of people who were not at all concerned about the fate of Nigeria but who wished to create a **crisis** or a situation of tension in Nigeria which could be used, when it came to bloodshed, to heighten racial tension throughout Africa, and which could be used in Asia.

* There, he said, "I have found an island of peace in a sea of discord and I recognize it is not a question of whether Britain has been right or Nigeria has been right, but of what is right for Nigeria ; and that I was being used by people who were not at all concerned about the settlement of the **crisis** in Nigeria, but who were using the **crisis** in Nigeria ".

* Ti; was not that he became any less determined for Nigeria's self-government; it was that he realized that the people who wished to provoke a **crisis** of bloodshed were not interested in Nigerian selfgovernment.

* They were interested in the ideological effects of a **crisis** throughout the world.

* A **crisis** provoked  in  Tunisia, Morocco,  or  Algeria could be used as a wedge to detach Pakistan from the Baghdad pact, or  to  put out propaganda against the Baghdad pact,  or  Pakistan's association with the  Western  Powers.

* It was a **crisis** of such a nature that one might expect that the races which had been involved in it would never wish to look at one another or to speak to one another again.

* My own feeling about the matter is that the central bank has insufficient authority to meet an economic **crisis**.

* However, the bill now before the House does not strengthen the power of the central bank, or provide proper machinery to enable an economic **crisis** to be met.

* The decision of the High Court in declaring invalid section 48 of the Banking Act caused the Labour Government at that time less concern about its powers in the event of a future **crisis** than did the knowledge that the private banks were unwilling to accept, the guidance of the central bank.

* In view of the fact that an appreciable period has elapsed since the double dissolution constitutional **crisis** of 1951, is there now any good reason why the papers concerning the granting of the double dissolution should not be placed before the Parliament?

* There is no use in having a democracy unless it can rise to a **crisis** as well as a dictatorship.

* Apart from accredited representatives that are sent by Australian newspapers to Asia to cover some **crisis** or some particular aspect- of their work, the Australian press relies mainly on Reuters or some similar news organization.

* I admit that, in the coal **crisis** in 1949, that jurisdiction was exercised under a special act that was of a temporary nature only and was repealed when the **crisis** was over.

* It was only because the war brought a **crisis** and because people were prepared to make sacrifices that Labour was able to stay in power a little longer during the last war.

* The honorable member for Bendigo  (Mr. Clarey)  asked in the course of the debate who felt the brunt of an economic **crisis**.

* Further, if the Minister has an opportunity of reviewing this agreement, will the Government give serious consideration either to wholly freezing repayments, including rentals and other commitments, or to reducing substantially these yearly charges until the economic **crisis** on the island has been overcome?

* .- During the course of this debate on the Middle East **crisis**, there is always a danger that the fundamental facts relating to it will become obscured, so 1 think that we should just have another look at them.

* Dealing with the Middle East **crisis** that conference decided - 
I should like to take some specific statements from that speech, analyse them and show, I hope, exactly what they imply.

* He said, " The responsibility for the farming **crisis** lies squarely at the Government's door ".

* To show there has not been in  any  sense a **crisis** - the word as used by the honorable member for Bendigo and the Leader of the Opposition is  a  complete exaggeration  -  T point out that last vear the gross value of farm income was 1.116,000,000, which was only 13 per cent,  lower  than that of the highest year, 1956-57.

* The Prime Minister, it will be remembered by honorable members, brought this question up for general debate on 25th September, when he came back from the meetings in connexion with the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* 1 do not wish to be misunderstood foi a moment, and I shall repeat that in referring to Great Britain in this **crisis**,- one knows perfectly well that the Government does not, or at any rate it is by no means certain that it does, represent the majority of the people.

* That was surely the original intention, but for some time Britain and France were dissuaded, and then darker forces and evil advisers got to work, and in the **crisis** affecting Israel some one said, "This is the time to make our attack ".

* It was appalling to think that these were the people upon whose army we must rely in the **crisis** that was then beginning to threaten under Hitler.

* These things may clear up, but a **crisis** may develop.

* In view of the statement by the Liberal Lord Mayor of Brisbane, which city is facing a loan money **crisis**, that the Australian Loan Council had fixed an interest rate which at present is completely unrealistic, and that various financial institutions would gladly lend the Brisbane City Council money if it were permitted to offer a higher rate of interest, would be the right honorable gentleman  infform  the House if there is any likelihood of the maximum rate of interest on local government loans being raised?

* The budget recognizes that we are at a certain point of re-adjustment, not only in our own affairs, but also in the international **crisis**.

* On that occasion, the great United States of America held out for the last penny from its creditors, the main creditor being Great Britain, and thus helped to precipitate a **crisis**: but since World WaT II., with wisdom and generosity, the United States of America has poured countless billions of dollars into other countries of the world, not only to prop up the partially destroyed economies of those countries, but also to help its allies.

* I suggest that whilst we have not yet reached the point of **crisis**, this country may yet have to face up to a policy of reducing prices of primary products and, at the same time, paying a subsidy in order to keep incomes from primary production on the same level as incomes in the rest of the community.

* At all periods of **crisis** in the history of the Australian nation the people have turned to the Australian Labour party for help, and I believe that we are facing a **crisis** again to-day.

* I am certain that, just as in 1953 the people turned to the Labour party in the economic **crisis** of that time, and just as they turned to the Labour party in the national war-time **crisis** of 1941, they will turn again to the Labour party now knowing full well that it is the only party that can meet the **crisis** that we are facing.

* In spite of these things, the Minister for Primary Industry and the Government adopt a smug attitude and say that there is no **crisis** in housing, and no unemployment **crisis**.

* He said, " I admit no **crisis**.

* He said, " I admit no **crisis**.

* I admit no **crisis**.

* If that persists the housing **crisis** will be not a **crisis** but chaos.

* The Prime Minister said " I. admit no **crisis**.

* Are we to believe that she, sitting with her aspidistras, and knitting a sock for the Red Cross, is the villain of the housing **crisis**?

* he issued a challenge to the Prime Minister to come into New South Wales, where the **crisis** is deepest, and said that he would show him 83 timber mills closed.

* And still the Government persists in saying that the **crisis** is one of man-power and materials only.

* In a **crisis** of this nature we should not look at the Middle East from the narrow, miserable political viewpoint of for and against.

* Russia's right to participate as an equal of the Western powers in a settlement of the Middle East **crisis** cannot be denied.

* Events over the past week or so point to the fact that the Middle East **crisis** has got no worse.

* Although Australia is not worse off than are other comparable countries of the world, no thinking person will deny that in spite of our apparent prosperity we are rapidly approaching an economic **crisis**, and shall reach that unfortunate stage soon unless something is done to prevent it.

* The honorable member for Gippsland  (Mr. Bowden)  said that we are now facing a period of economic **crisis**.

* I believe that that **crisis** has been caused by the failure of this Government to concentrate upon the task of finding a- solution of our economic problems.

* A situation of that kind can occur only when there is a condition of such acute economic **crisis** in a community that the people say that normal methods of dealing with such a situation, by parliaments and other established institutions, have failed.

* We have a Prime Minister who, in the Australian constitutional situation, and in practice, has from time to time been the de facto Minister for External Affairs, and very particularly so in important matters like the Suez **crisis**, where, it seems to me on the evidence, the decisions made by Australia were made by the Prime Minister without much reference even to the Minister for 
I should like to direct the attention of the committee to the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* I direct the attention of the House to a particularly scandalous and gross breach of confidence that occurred in this House this morning, when the Leader of the Opposition  (Dr. Evatt)  referred to incidents which are alleged to have occurred during the Suez **crisis**.

* The Leader of the Opposition referred to incidents which took place, or which he alleged took place, during the Suez **crisis**.

* The Leader of the Opposition said, " During the Suez **crisis**.

* I invite the attention of the House to what has been done and what has been said in this House, and I invite the Leader of the Opposition either to get up and confess that it was a fabrication or, alternatively, to apologize to the Ministers and to the House for the gross breach of confidence that he committed in saying that the Treasurer, then Acting Prime Minister, and the Minister for External Affairs said to him certain things in confidential discussion during the Suez **crisis**.

* Australia's attitude was that, in an overseas funds **crisis**, it must be able to exercise its own judgment on the need to restrict the flow of imports, and on the extent, of restriction necessary to protect its international solvency.

* The time has come for us to co-operate intelligently in order to meet the threat to the security of our economy and to avert, if not another economic **crisis**, at least a very embarrassing situation.

* Let me move on now and say something with regard to the Leader of the Opposition  (Dr. Evatt)  because it is rather interesting to note that he launched an attack upon the Government for having dared to ask for power in this time of great **crisis**.

* The Government, in the teeth of trade union opposition and realizing the difficulties that confronted it in the world **crisis**, increased the period of national service for the troops.

* The first was the action taken at the time of the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* I do not wish to name individuals, but the work performed by our Minister Plenipotentiary in Cairo during the Suez -**crisis** and the excellent report on Hungary promulgated the other day by one of our Australian diplomatists are splendid examples.

* One recalls the great international **crisis** of last year over the Suez Canal.

* I realize that such an action by the Australian Government would cause a financial **crisis**.

* What have we done for Asia over the last 200 years to entitle us to claim its allegiance and co-operation in the present **crisis** in that vast areas?

* I ask the Minister for External Affairs, by way of a supplementary question, arising out of the last question, how he reconciles his puerile sycophancy of  Mr. Dulles  with the statement made by  Mr. Dulles  at the time of the Suez **crisis** that he would prefer, if he were an American serviceman, not to fight alongside British soldiers?

* Mr. John Foster Dulles with the statement made by that gentleman, at the time of the Egyptian **crisis**, that he would not wish to fight alongside a British or French soldier.

* Secondly, how does he justify his- 
Now let us review the honorable member's speech, and consider whether he spoke with sincerity or whether he was just talking in the manner that is characteristic of the Opposition whenever a matter arises, even a national **crisis**, out of which it can make political capital.

* He spoke with his tongue in his cheek merely for the sake, of making party political capital out of the **crisis** that besets the country.

* I remind honorable members that that sentiment was expressed six weeks after the Munich incident, when it must have been obvious to anybody that Australia and the whole world would soon face a **crisis**.

* This Government inherited a position of grave defence unpreparedness  espe- cially  having regard to the **crisis** which confronted it shortly after it took office.

* Is it suggested that in a time of **crisis** like the present we should not obtain more jet engines and Merlin engines, that we should not build more aeroplanes in government factories, including Lincoln bombers, or that we should abandon the Hawker and Canberra projects?

* At the last general election, the people of Australia took the view that the present **crisis** was sufficiently urgent to require the return of this Government with a clear mandate to take strong and definite action to put the country in a state of preparedness.

* The right honorable gentleman made the following statement : - 
Thus, the judgments of the members of the High Court, the body which protects the liberty of the subject, show that the members of the Bench are fully seised of the necessity for the Government to have some power to make regulations in order to meet a **crisis** that might threaten the security of the country.

* It found it necessary to prepare the country's defences so that in the event of a **crisis** we should be able to defend ourselves.

* The Government's policy to meet this **crisis** was made known on a nondiscriminatory basis, not only to the A.N.A.

* which borders on disaster, and threatening **crisis** demands bold measures.

* We are face to face with a butter **crisis**, not only in Australia but throughout the world.

* We have given close attention to the **crisis** in which the dairying industry finds itself through no fault of its own.

* The time of **crisis** had not arrived.

* The Labour party, unfortunately, is a **crisis** party.

* This afternoon we listened to a comprehensive, closely reasoned statement of the views of this Government on the recent **crisis** in the Middle East.

* What has occurred there and what could occur there may have a profound effect, and the Australian people are entitled to know the attitude of their Government on such a **crisis**.

* We applaud the unity of the United Kingdom and the United States in this **crisis** and in the common action which they have taken.

* We favour United Nations action in this **crisis**, and we hope very much to see the establishment of a United Nations commission, backed by the strength of a United Nations police force, in the Middle East.

* That is my own summary of the Government's attitude in this **crisis**.

* This **crisis** in the Middle East blew up quickly and without notice.

* It is significant that the propaganda of Russia and the propaganda of Egypt in the months preceding this **crisis** bore a very striking resemblance.

* This **crisis** can be seen in true perspective only against the whole struggle of the free world to survive against the menace of Communist aggression.

* It is profitable, I believe, to recall in this **crisis** the main lines of Communist propaganda in recent years.

* I refer to the great Suez **crisis**.

* We saw all the cables and all the communications on the Suez **crisis** and we gave our advice to those Ministers.

* If our advice had been taken - and I think I can say that our views were identical with those of the Acting Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs - there would have been a very different solution to the Egyptian **crisis**.

* We might make it a practice to do what was done during the Suez **crisis**.

* There' was no better Australian in that **crisis** than the present Leader of the Opposition.

* Now that we have General Motors-Holden's Limited in Australia and know how to make motor cars, we are in a better position to defend Australia in the event of a **crisis*** We finished World War II.

* I have chosen transport as my subject because, within twelve months, we will be facing a **crisis** in transport.

* Indeed, there is already a **crisis** in that field and if the transport problem, in all its aspects, is allowed to drift along from bad to worse, we shall soon be in a very serious position in every State of this country.

* As I said at the outset, if we do not begin now, we shall have very few roads worthy of the name within twelve months, and we shall have on our hands a major **crisis** in road, rail and other transport services.

* - The remarks of the honorable member for Calare  (Mr. Howse)  about the transport **crisis** were a timely contribution to this debate.

* I refer to the economic position and the gradual building up by the Prime Minister of an atmosphere of economic **crisis**.

* In the absence of the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden),  he told us what the economic **crisis** was.

* He said, " It is a real economic **crisis** " ; but the truth is that the **crisis** is mostly imaginary and has been caused, to a large extent, by mismanagement on the part of the Government.

* He did so in the hope of saving the humble people, who looked upon him as a champion, frOm the worst blows of the **crisis**.

* The ease of the other path, and the difficulties of the path which he chose in order to try to save the people from the severest scourgings  of the economic **crisis**, are, I think, obvious to all.

* .- The committee this afternoon has heard submissions from honorable members opposite supporting the argument put forward by the Government that there is really no housing **crisis** or housing shortage in Australia at the present time because the Government has maintained an adequate level of home construction during its term of office.

* They are ten actual cases which show the true **crisis** in housing at the present time.

* To use a term favoured by economists we have a " scissors " **crisis**.

* The **crisis** is not fundamental, hut has been caused by a lack of policy and a lack of action by the Government, which has been indifferent to the difficulties that have confronted the country as a whole and the people individually.

* At the time of the freezing of the basic wage, in September, 1953, there was talk of a **crisis**.

* Lord D'Aliernon, British financier, statesman and diplomat, speaking on the economic **crisis** in 1931, said - 
Before the suspension for lunch the right honorable member for Barton  (Dr. Evatt)  rebuked the honorable member for Angas  (Mr. Downer)  for being so caustic in his remarks concerning the honorable member for East Sydney.

* Then the right honorable member for Barton, with characteristic immodesty, said, " During the Suez **crisis** I advised the Government what to do.

* As I have said, on the occasion to which I have referred, the process of declining wages was hastened by a 10 per cent, cut because of the economic **crisis**.

* My object in drawing the attention of honorable members to these matters is to show that the system of quarterly adjustments of wages, which has been attacked in many quarters during the last six months, has operated fairly for 30 years, including seven years of prosperity, seven years of depression, six years of war, and the years of economic **crisis** through which we are now passingTo suggest that the economic problem can be solved by the mere process of discontinuing the automatic adjustment of wages is simply to pay attention to the symptom when the cause is ever so much deeper than is realized.

* Bank for the economic depression, at least it can he said that, had the Commonwealth Bank Board been fully cognizant of its responsibility to the community, thoroughly efficient, and well versed in world economic developments, it would have done much to protect the nation from the worst effects of the **crisis**.

* .- The Opposition has brought forward this matter to-day as a matter of urgency, in the only way it can do so, because members on this side feel that the Government has not been frank or reasonable concerning the wheat **crisis** which has come upon this country but has left this House and the nation completely in the dark in regard to the wheat position generally.

* At the present time, as everybody knows, there is a **crisis** in the wheat industry.

* The Australian Country party supports the Liberal party for the sake of five portfolios in a coalition government; but the Australian Country party has not uttered one protest in this Parliament about wheat, although its leader in the New South Wales Parliament,  Colonel Bruxner,  and his associate, are solidly behind the Premier of New South Wales,  Mr. Cahill,  in asking that since a **crisis** exists in New South Wales, the Commonwealth Government should, for the sake of wheat stabilization, provide some of the additional cost of 5,000,000- 4,000,000 for freight and 1,000,000 for distribution costs.

* While the Government pares the wheatfarmers down and allow prices to be increased to the consumer, it lets the middle man get away with cold-blooded murder in a time of **crisis** and shortage.

* They lack the rather moderate amount of brains necessary to appreciate the fundamental cost **crisis** facing the nation.

* The present " grab-all " habit, concentrating on demand after demand to raise the basic wage, has not only precipitated a cost **crisis** that has priced Australia out of world markets in secondary industry and is rapidly pricing her out of primary markets as well, it hag created the margins **crisis** in the trade union movement itself, and denied the skilled man anything like a fair return for his skill.

* This **crisis** has been coming for 12 years.

* Any one charged with the responsibility of governing the country did not need to be very bright to be able to add 12 to 1947 and arrive at 1959 and so to see that this was going to be a year of **crisis** in the secondary education system of Australia.

* If there is one thing you can rely on the present Federal Government for, when any sort of real **crisis** approaches, it is complete and absolute inertia.

* Nothing less will suffice to meet the growing **crisis**.

* It appears to me that these indispensable institutions are left to flounder from **crisis** to **crisis**.

* As for what has happened in the past, I propose, next week, to make a statement on the matters that we are concerned with, and as the right honor.able gentleman has asked me this question, I should perhaps take this early opportunity of saying that what we are considering, and what we propose to deal with in one way or another, is not some **crisis** but a problem which ought to be dealt with now, in order that we may not have some critical state of affairs in the future.

* Every honorable gentleman knows that that restriction of the normal flow of finance became a major **crisis** in his own electorate.

* It is a major **crisis** for the man who, after having served his country in war-time, has no home for his wife and children.

* Lack of housing is a major **crisis** to the unfortunate ex-servicemen who have no homes for their families.

* It is an additional **crisis** when we realize that the War Service Homes Division itself has closed one of the Government's escape hatches, because financial assistance will not be granted the ex-servicemen who desire to purchase existing dwellings.

* Red China's action, well-timed to divert attention from the mounting Berlin **crisis**, has placed her virtually astride the Himalayas and on the borders of neutralist India.

* Theright honorable gentleman discussed at some length what he claimed to be an [impending **crisis** inthe textile industry in Australia.

* The significant point is that, on the one hand, we have the Leader of the Opposition claiming that this agreement will cause a **crisis** in the textile industry, and, on the other hand, we have direct evidence in the facts that I have just related, and in a matter that I shall mention in a moment, that imports are the lifeblood of the industry.

* Trade with great textile manufacturing countries, such as India, which are low-cost countries, has not so far caused any **crisis** in the Australian textile industry such as the Opposition now predicts will result from the entry of another low-cost country into the field of Australian trade.

* The Australian Shipping Commission cannot compete in the charter trade unless there are very special circumstances such as the Suez **crisis** which temporarily bump freight rates above their normal level.

* Was the price of petrol per gallon to the consumer increased as a result of higher shipping rates following the Suez **crisis** of last year?

* Have these rates now fallen below the level reached as a result of that **crisis**; if so, what is the reason for the continuance by the oil companies of the increase of id.

* Sales tax has now reached an aggregate figure which is far higher than it was in the years of greatest **crisis** during World War II.

* Has the dollar gap in payments between the United States of America and some other countries become so serious as to be described as more serious than the Middle East **crisis**?

* If the position is as stated, will the Treasurer, during his visit to North America, emphasize the significance of the dollar gap **crisis**?

* Honorable members are becoming accustomed to financial statements from the Prime Minister from time to time, each one telling of a new economic **crisis** or giving a further description of other crises that have plagued Australia since the Liberal party-Australian Country party Government came into office.

* Australia is passing through a period of severe economic **crisis**.

* But the trade union movement knew that, in a great **crisis** such as that which existed in  1940,  private enterprise could not be trusted.

* During the period when the Curtin Government was in power, its pro-Russian faction happened by accident to be onside, but that faction will not be onside if the present world situation should reach a **crisis**.

* Only a few years ago, during the **crisis** of war, when the Curtin Labour Government was in power in this House, but not in control of the Senate, the anti-Labour Opposition in the Senate resorted to all sorts of manoeuvres to defeat its legislation.

* In two of the greatest periods of **crisis** in the history of the Commonwealth - the economic depression of the thirties, and, during the years of World War II.

* It is only in times of great **crisis**, such as war or a national disaster, that people will allow their representatives' attention to transcend the boundaries of their electorates and permit him to act in the national interest.

* .- During the last two months in which we have been, passing through this **crisis**, we have heard two spokesmen announce what people -thought was the policy of the Government.

* The first was the Prime 
A victory for Labour in this election would, beyond the slightest doubt, land this country into an international and internal financial **crisis**.

* Such a **crisis** would set back the great and dynamic development -which it ha been and is our principal ambition to' encourage.

* I think it was the honorable member for Evans  (Mr. Osborne)  who said that this Government had inherited an economic **crisis** from the Labour Government in 1949.

* The Prime Minister also said that the Opposition was recklessly eager to convince the people that there is an economic **crisis** in this country.

* We do not have to convince the people of that fact because they already know that such a **crisis** exists.

* If a **crisis** comes, all of us, irrespective of political creed or religious philosophy, will be involved as before.

* I suggest that if one reads carefully between the lines of the budget speech which was delivered by the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden)  recently, and if one reads the economic homily that was delivered by the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  on what has been called the " **crisis** of the nation ", which seems to have evaporated in the few weeks since that speech was delivered, one comes to the conclusion that there has been .rather too much private development in the economy as a whole.

* I ask: Does the right honorable gentleman agree with the belated statement by the Minister for National Development, last week, that the coal industry faces a **crisis** owing to the trend towards the increasing use of oil as a fuel, and that, if the trend continues, coal will be relegated to a minor position as a source of fuel?

* One would have thought that we were back in the depths of depression because these men were accomplishing nothing of a permanent, nature, and the Government was using a transparent expedient to tide itself over a time of **crisis** in the hope that the community would forget all about its handling of the immigrants.

* Middle East affairs have been so complex that, for the ordinary individual, it is very hard to follow the meaning of events of years gone by and right up to the time of the Suez **crisis**.

* This caused Egypt to seek and obtain arms from Russia, thereby giving the Soviet political influence in the whole Middle East area - a feature which brought Israel and Egypt to war with each other, and ultimately precipitated the Suez **crisis** and the nationalizing of the Suez Canal.

* In fact, the- Israeli-Egyptian affair and the Suez **crisis** demonstrated that the time had passed when peace could be achieved' through war.

* When I assumed the portfolioof Defence Production I made up my mind that, if T were to continue to occupy it, 1' must ensure that Australia would not be faced with a shortage of munitions in a time of **crisis**.

* There can be no doubt that to-day we are facing an economic **crisis**, and every one must remember that this Government has been in office since  1949.

* Australia is now confronted with a production **crisis** that demands wholehearted co-operation to ensure the general welfare and full employment.

* A serious production **crisis** is now being experienced in the dairying industry with a resultant shortage of butter and other dairy products for Australian requirements.

* That **crisis** largely arises from the inadequate reward which is received by producers for the number of hours worked by them weekly, and which is insufficient to enable them to compete for labour with more remunerative industries'.

* The Prime Minister tried to make the point that there was no dislocation of building activity and no **crisis** of any kind in this country, and he went on to dismiss as being of no importance the present level of unemployment in the building trades.

* He and other Government supporters tried to substantiate the argument that there is no **crisis** of any kind in the building industry.

* All the Government does is to try to make the people believe that there is no **crisis**, and to attack the achievements of Labour governments.

* This Budget is documentary evidence of the fact that the Government is bankrupt of ideas and completely incapable of coping with the enormous ramifications of the economic **crisis**.

* In what manner did the Treasurer approach the preparation of this pitiful apology for a Budget in the face of the economic **crisis** and threatening recession?

* It will not see that these problems have to be faced boldly, and its conduct over the last six or seven years as one **crisis** succeeds another shows that it 'has no idea of the manner in which the economic problems of this country can be solved.

* That the banking section of the community, which has been so favoured by this Government, should be permitted to escape its obligation to make a contribution towards Commonwealth revenue at this time of **crisis** is indeed shameful.

* The  Sydney Morning Herald  has published the following report : - 
It will be of interest to the House to have some brief information on this matter in order to appreciate that the industry is again, in 1959, facing another **crisis**.

* So, once again, the industry is faced with a **crisis** which, unless it can be surmounted, could have very serious effects upon the fruit-growers, the canneries, the cannery employees and the economy of the Commonwealth, because the millions of pounds that are being earned each year by the export of canned fruits will be reduced.

* The employees are just as much entitled to have a say in the protection of their economic interests when a **crisis** occurs in the industry as are the other interests which are represented on the board.

* I should like to point out, also, that, in every **crisis** that has arisen in the canning industry, the employers have always sought and received the co-operation and support of the unions in making representations in respect of matters such as a proper form of organization, the constitution of the Australian Canned Fruits Board, and proposals for assistance as a consequence of the increase in the price of sugar - which resulted in the establishment of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee.

* I am advised that there is simply not enough wheat left in this country to feed our poultry and pig populations, and that farmers are being advised to slaughter off their flocks and herds as the only solution to the **crisis**.

* Let us consider the intolerable position in which a government is placed when a bank board has the right to determine what that government shall do in the legislative field to deal with an economic **crisis**.

* I believe that men who have indicated that they are prepared to serve their country in a period of **crisis** are entitled to this badge.

* No doubt many of the new members, regardless of whether they are on the Opposition or the Government side, who have been relatively close to the people and have some appreciation of their problems, find it difficult to relate this flexibility to the failure of the Government to side step, for example, the great **crisis** of unemployment or to meet adequately the housing needs of the Australian people.

* A financial **crisis** of unprecedented proportions is evident in every State, and it affects seriously the third arm of government, that is, local government.

* In these difficult days of national **crisis** the ranks of ' the trade union movement and the manufacturing and producing industries should be closed.

* If the situation arose that the fund for wool research and publicity were short of money, this Government, which is confronted with a **crisis** with which it does not know how to deal, might provide the extra money that the fund required, but it is far more likely that, by regulation, it would force the wool-growers to pay an additional ls.

* The **crisis** that exists in the primary producing industries of this country has been caused by the indecision ofthe Government and bythe attacks that it has made upon primary producers in general, and upon wool-growers in particular.

* They have not given attention to the acute domestic **crisis** which is at present mounting in every direction in this country.

* There is, for example, the rapidly developing credit **crisis** - a carefully calculated policy fostered in recent years by the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden).

* It is, of course, an artificial **crisis**, which has been brought about by the restrictive central bank policy of the Government.

* One of these I shall call the rural **crisis**.

* Not only have we ceased to export many of our most important basic items, but we may also have to start importing food; yet the Government failed to indicate in the GovernorGeneral's Speech how it proposes to meet the rural **crisis**.

* He has declared, both outside and inside this chamber, that a **crisis** faces Australia.

* We face yet another **crisis** in the succession of them that we have experienced under this Government's administration.

* It gave away that power and is now dependent upon the goodwill and beneficence of those institutions, which are seeking to make profit out of the community, in order to meet increasing inflation and an economic **crisis**, as the Treasurer has stated.

* Last year, when a storage problem arose in an atmosphere of **crisis**, .the Australian Government made certain arrangements for the Australian Wheat Board to establish wheat stores.

* Concurrently with the **crisis** in the Middle East, events in eastern Europe have indicated the strains and stresses to which the satellite States are subject.

* The then member for Henty and an independent member named Wilson voted that Government out of office so that John Curtin and other members of the Labour movement could take charge of our affairs in a great **crisis**.

* Throughout Australia, there is a growing demand for a defence programme that will give us some protection in a **crisis**.

* Often, situations have risen that have caused us some anxiety, but we have believed that he is carrying out a most difficult job, and in the post-war period we have given General MacArthur the same support as the servicemen, the Government and the Parliament gave to him during the **crisis** of war.

* I believe it is an indictable deficiency on the part of the Government that I am the third successive Opposition speaker to rise to deal with the obvious **crisis** in the coal industry.

* No one can deny that there is indeed a very serious **crisis** on the coal-fields, and one would feel that a responsible government would take the opportunity to announce for the benefit of the people of Australia the manner in which the **crisis** may be overcome.

* The mining work force has responded remarkably well to this great **crisis**.

* In time of **crisis**, the board has suffered from an absence of co-operation on the part of the Commonwealth.

* Is the Prime Minister aware that the Opposition approves of the similarity between the newly adopted policy of the Government in relation to the Middle East and the long-standing policy of the Opposition in this matter, as stated, for example, by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech on the Suez Canal **crisis** last year, in which he enumerated five of the points now accepted by the Prime Minister?

* .- The Labour Opposition, in making this question of transport a matter of extreme urgency, feels that if the Government does not bestir itself in regard to Australia's transport problem this country will be faced with a **crisis** that could do irreparable harm to our economy.

* Oh, yes, he said it was a **crisis**.

* The honorable gentleman, unlike the newly appointed doctor from Yarra- 
In the period 1933 and 1934 we noticed an emergence from the **crisis** with a stabilization of prices.

* Should a **crisis** arise, I suppose we shall be told - as is indicated by the further amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition - that the present Government is to blame.

* Secondly, the growing adverse trade balance creates another **crisis** affecting the employment of many workers.

* The weakest link in Australian defence at the present moment is the Federal Cabinet The **crisis** of September made thousands of Australians realize, probably for first time, that Australia's powerful neighbour in the Pacific was a potential enemy and that Australia could not, under every set of circumstances, completely rely on a strong British navy in the Pacific to protect her from invasion.

* When a **crisis** arises, whether an economic **crisis** or war, the Labour party has to be sent for in order to clean up the mess, and get the job done.

* .- The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr. McMahon)  has succeeded admirably in further confusing his own supporters and the general public as to where the Government really stands in the present **crisis** confronting the nation.

* Lurking behind the scenes of  thi3  present **crisis** and of other past crises in this country are the directors of the private trading banks.

* say that there is a housing **crisis** in the true meaning of the word " **crisis** ", even though it is possible to admit that there is a housing shortage in the community.

* this House, will not agree that there is a national **crisis** in housing.

* If, as I maintain, our system is  not  working well at the moment, we should consider what would happen if it were submitted to the larger stress that might be laid upon it should there be any intensification of the present internal **crisis**.

* We have had too long and sad an experience of how overseas investors get all they can out of the country and then, if a **crisis** comes, take their money out and leave many people destitute and in misery in Australia.

* If that policy was good enough in a time of national **crisis**, when we were threatened with invasion, surely it is good enough to-day !

* I1-  admitted that it was bold legislation, but said that it was justified in view of the **crisis** that had arisen as the result of the coal strike.

* Surely, the **crisis** tint exists at present in this country constitutes a greater menace to our security than did the coal strike that occurred last year.

* The ratification of these conventions by this Parliament postulates that in time of war or in time of **crisis**, Australia will behave in accordance with certain standards; certain proprieties will be observed; certain things will be done, and certain things will not be done.

* A person does not create a housing **crisis** merely by saying that there is one, and we have been arguing here for a day and a half only on the name of something.

* We have been engaged in this argument because it has been said that there is a **crisis** in housing.

* It might even be said, and equally well, that there is a **crisis** in the position of the States' hospitals.

* And that there is a **crisis** in the States' schools.

* And that there is a **crisis** in road construction in the States.

* If, through any unforeseen circumstance such as a war, the Government is put to extra expense, or if there is a sudden drop in income due to an economic **crisis**, the Government could bring down an emergency budget.

* The early part of the debate resolved itself into an argument as to whether or not there is a **crisis** in housing.

* I believe that the dictionary defines a **crisis** as something concerned with a peak.

* I venture to say that there is no **crisis** in housing, even though it may be shown that there is a shortage of housing.

* A **crisis** in housing in this country was reached about the year 1948.

* this Parliament were themselves badly affected by that housing **crisis**, and have painful memories of that period.

* But when we reach the point where a house is offered to a person and is rejected because of its location, or its distance from a person's place of work, it can hardly be claimed that there is a housing **crisis**.

* So, there has been no great response by the individual manual worker to the severity of the **crisis**, as it is described inside the industry.

* If the **crisis** is of the magnitude described by the right honorable gentleman, he might very well take up with his colleague, the Premier of New South Wales, the question of priorities, particularly as the Premier of New South Wales can set aside at least 1,500,000 in this year's Budget to extend annual leave from two to three weeks for his employees and to introduce the principle of equal pay for male and female employees.

* However, if there is a **crisis** in the coal industry of New South Wales, with coal-miners unable to find proper, opportunities for work, how can the Premier of that State afford the luxury of an additional expenditure of 1,500,000 on these matters?

* The Middle East **crisis** has been fully commented upon by my colleagues, but let me quote Labour's policy in that regard.

* It is as follows: - 
On the contrary, the Australian Government has, by the Prime Minister's action in the Suez **crisis**, completely abandoned the principles of the Atlantic Charter, deliberately repudiated Australia's pledged adherence to U.N.O., and gravely injured Australia's reputation throughout the world.

* They will have to choose between what we stand for - sound finance with a maximum restraint to inflation in order to preserve the value of money and of savings - or, on the other hand, crazy finance with wild inflation, rocketing prices, fabulous costs - which would, of course, be involved - for works and housing, a crippling blow at the export industries and, above all - and I hope that this will never come upon us; it certainly will not so far as we are concerned as a government - a financial **crisis**, which is the only thing that could be produced by this queer alternative policy, leading, for the first time since the depression, to mass unemployment.

* In this **crisis** in the nation's economy let us use our resources upon things that really matter."

* I think that an honorable member is entitled to ask the right honorable gentleman whether his decision to open that hotel is representative of the kind of leadership that Australia requires in this present period of economic **crisis**.

* Bui when the Suez **crisis** arose and oil supplies from the Middle East were interrupted, these great patriots whom honorable members opposite are so prone to talk about, the oil monopolists, immediately raised the price of oil in their own country of America by 1 2 per cent.

* This is what the New York " Post " had to say about this action of the oil monopolists - 
The fact that a **crisis** exists in the timber industry has been denied by the Prime Minister.

* One-third more finance is needed in each State to bridge the gap and avert a great **crisis** in the building industry.

* **crisis** in its history.

* If Opposition members really believe that what we are doing has not the approval of the great majority of the people of this country,  let  thom bring the **crisis** to a head in the most rapid possible way.

* During the whole of this debate honorable members opposite have moaned because, they contend, we are facing an economic **crisis**.

* The Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden),  in his budget speech, declared that we are still living in an era of prosperity, and at the same time he stated that we are about to face a **crisis**.

* The Minister for Health  (Sir Earle Page)  indicated in no uncertain manner only the other day that we now face a **crisis**.

* The only cure that the Treasurer can propose for the **crisis** that he contends we are now about to meet is the old story that the wage-earner must pull in his belt.

* The Government admits that Australia is confronted with a **crisis** - and there is no doubt that, it is.

* Perhaps of even more importance than other considerations, in the short range, is the fact that, as I have said, our oil supplies, along with those of a great part of the free world, are threatened by the present **crisis** in the Middle East.

* That **crisis** has had one salutary effect so far as the future of the Australian coal industry is concerned.

* They have read well the warning given us by the present position &gt; the Middle East which is, in effect, that we cannot forever rely on obtaining Middle East oil, and shall have to see what we can do about producing oil for ourselves for use in the event of an international **crisis**, just as Germany had to do in World War I., using her own coal resources for the extraction of oil.

* The trading banks say that they are prepared to accept the leadership of the central bank, but have they concealed it in time of economic **crisis**?

* But in time of **crisis**, when inflation rears its ugly head, or deflation is the order of the day and the people's assets are threatened, the private banks safeguard their own welfare and disregard the common good.

* I want so many jobs to be available that people from other countries can come to Australia, secure employment and help to develop the country during its time of need and **crisis**.

* Our opposition to the measure is also based on the record of the previous Commonwealth Bank Board during the economic **crisis** from 1930 to 1934  -  Australia's economic Dunkirk - when the bank failed this country in its hour of need.

* The test of any government is how it handles its job in a **crisis** and that observation applies also to individual leaders, or persons, charged with grave responsibility in any sphere.

* During the economic **crisis** from 1930 to 1934 when the Commonwealth Bank was under the control of a board it failed the country abjectly and completely.

* During that **crisis** those who controlled the Commonwealth Bank made finance our master instead of our servant.

* Members of the Government have eulogized the system of board control, even though it failed us in the greatest economic **crisis** in our history.

* Is it also a fact that the honorable member for Balaclava was the member selected to replace  Mr. Speaker  for this purpose, but that the plot failed wl.en he was deserted in the hour of **crisis** and secured only thirteen votes out of a possible 83?

* There is no **crisis**.

* In 1931 1 was a Minister when the great financial **crisis** occurred.

* I shudder, on looking back to the days of **crisis** in the early 1930's, to think that this Government intends to re-establish the board system.

* I shudder also to think that in the event of a national economic **crisis** such men as those who constituted the former bank board, excellent citizens though they were, would once again be the guardians of the economic life of this country.

* Housing, the most important issue of all, was passed over by the Prime Minister with the assurance that there was no **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister, in replying to the Leader of the Opposition, said he was satisfied that there was no **crisis** in the building industry, and that it was a question not of money but of materials and labour.

* Though the Prime Minister said that he was satisfied that material and labour alone were holding up the housing programme, one of his own Ministers - who, incidentally, is personally interested in this phase of activity - admitted on at least three or four occasions in his speech last week that there was a serious housing **crisis** in Australia.

* He made certain suggestions with a view to overcoming that **crisis**, thus contradicting his own Prime Minister.

* Further proof that the Prime Minister has made an untruthful statement is provided by the fact that last week the State Housing Ministers of Australia, at a lengthy conference in Melbourne, were unanimous that there was a housing **crisis**.

* They agreed that the **crisis** was attributable to the attitude of this Government in refusing to allow the States sufficient money to carry out housing programmes.

* He was the man for the job in a great **crisis**.

* It was a great honour to bc associated with him, as some of us were, during earlier periods, and he was intensely grateful to the people of this country for the economic help that came to Ceylon in a time of great **crisis** during the last war.

* The financial **crisis** in Australian National Airways which has received so much publicity in recent weeks was not peculiar to that company, but was in our view symptomatic of the economic condition of the entire air transport industry.

* It is not very rewarding in these circumstances to find a financial **crisis** developing in the industry every few years.

* Housing, education, local government, hospitalization, trade and many basic industries are in a state of **crisis**.

* As  a  matter of fact, it was framed to meet this hour of **crisis** in Australia's history.

* We may sum them up as follows: - First, we must deal with home policy and arouse the nation to the seriousness of the **crisis** and its possible effects on our future.

* Australia has never yet failed to measure up to its responsibilities, and even more than its responsibilities, once it knew the nature of the **crisis**.

* The result is a mounting financial burden, and an economic **crisis**.

* The Government has proved that it is incapable of controlling Australia's destiny in a time of **crisis**.

* It evades its duty to mend and end the housing **crisis**.

* The weakness, the uncertainty of the bond market, exists because this Government did not play fair with the bondholders who came to the assistance of this country in the **crisis** of war.

* The responsibility for the farming **crisis** in Australia lies squarely at the Government's door.

* Having let inflation run riot, they passed from one economic **crisis** to another.

* I say that advisedly after having listened very patiently to the Leader of the Opposition, who said, in effect, " In this **crisis**, not a man and not a shilling".

* Let us see what the Minister says is the Government's policy to meet this **crisis** in which several groups made overtures for the purchase of A.N.A.

* The present **crisis** is due to a combination of world factors arising mainly from war and its aftermath.

* Referring to the depression of the 1930's, I made my analysis in these words - let me emphasize one lesson which emerged from that great **crisis**.

* I feel some relief in knowing that one aseminent as Professor Colin Clark holds the view that this course is not the means of combating the present **crisis**.

* .- I agree with the honorable member for Flinders  (Mr. Lindsay)  that the situation in the Middle East could easily provoke a **crisis** in which Australia could be involved, but I am immediately concerned with a **crisis** that exists within this Commonwealth, of a most explosive nature, and which could cause great dissatisfaction, and even disaster, for many Australian people.

* It is this Government which must accept the whole of the blame for the **crisis**.

* It would appear from the speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  last night that he refuses to believe that there is a housing **crisis** in Australia to-day.

* In the course of his speech he said, " I deny a **crisis**; I deny a slump ".

* Must insist that all sections building industry now facing **crisis**.

* I shall conclude by repeating that there is a **crisis** in the building industry in Queensland, where the Housing Commission is labouring under great difficulties.

* the whole of the Middle East situation, including the Suez **crisis**, is the struggle of the world monopolies to control oil supplies,  ls  that seriously disputed?

* With a board constituted along the lines for which the bill provides, the members with a practical knowledge of primary and secondary industries will be able to submit their views in the event of a **crisis** and thus induce the board as a whole to adopt a reasonable attitude.

* Similar legal victories were gained in the coal **crisis** of 1949.

* The Minister for National Development  (Senator Spooner)  had the audacity to say at a Chamber of Commerce dinner in Newcastle last year that there was no **crisis** in the coal industry, that the coal industry was producing more coal with less labour.

* As the Government's precipitate action in curtailing imports has caused a national **crisis** and a weakening of the entire British economy, when docs the Treasurer envisage the restrictions being removed and what action is the Government taking to ensure that it will not be necessary to re-impose them?

* Perhaps 10 per cent, is a very high percentage  because  a* an international trader, he has so many other irons in the fire that an industrial **crisis** on the Australian waterfront will not deal him the crippling blow that will fall upon the Australian shipowners.

* The truth is that a foolishly-led strike - and I think personally the man who led it put his men into a critical union conflict without their real moral consent, and without any thought for the general position or opinion in New Zealand - produced a **crisis** in which the Government of New Zealand brought out an 18-in.

* The situation there now is of complete bitter resentment, and I am pretty sure that in that well-known situation we will find that the smashing of that union by the full coercive powers of the New Zealand Government two years ago, at the time of that **crisis**, will have embittering consequences on the New Zealand waterfront for many years to come.

* I firmly believe that the intervention of the United Nations in the Suez **crisis** started a chain of events that could easily become the pattern for the settling of future international disputes.

* Its action precipitated a **crisis** the manifestations of which are only now being felt, and are likely to increase as time passes unless we do something to remedy the situation.

* They are as follows :- 1930, 3,500,000; 1931, 8,500,000; 1939, 9,000,000; 1943, at the height of the war **crisis**, 2S,000,000; 1946, 33,000,000; 1948, 34,000,000; 1949, 39,000,000.

* For every 1 collected from sales tax in 1943, during the peak of the war **crisis**, by a Labour government, he proposes  to collect 3 in a time of peace.

* The fund should be retained so that, in the event of financial **crisis**, the recipients of social services will not be the first section of the community to suffer a reduction of thenbenefits, as happened in 1929-30.

* Licensing is done on a quarterly basis, and in the quarter which ended on the 30th September last category A imports were permitted at 85 per cent, of the base year, but owing to the present **crisis** against which action was taken on the 1st October last, a further cut of 12- per cent, was imposed.

* Unless, within- the next two years) we place ourselves in- a more advantageous position, Australia may well face an economic **crisis** of the most formidable magnitude.

* I have seen some press reports regarding the **crisis** in Pakistan that do not appear to be wholly accurate.

* His report is awaited not only with eagerness, but with anxiety, so that the House may have an opportunity to debate it and to express an opinion as to what Australia should do in this great **crisis**.

* I desire to address my remarks to that part of  His  Excellency's Speech in which it is indicated that the Government proposes to adopt certain methods to meet the economic **crisis** that it fears may he facing us.

* I also fear that an economic **crisis** is coming to this country, because I have lived long enough to remember the economic **crisis** that we suffered in what is known as the hungry 30's.

* Because present conditions are similar to the conditions that preceded the economic **crisis** of 1929 and the 1930's, I am of the opinion that another economic **crisis** is likely to overtake us.

* If those in authority will act humanely they may be able to maintain peace in this  industry,  and prevent an economic **crisis**.

* If  n stoppage occurs, it may lead to a great **crisis**.

* In that year of **crisis** the amount that was withdrawn and undistributed profits were considerably more than double the total that came in.

* The outflow of funds necessary to service overseas investment is growing continuously, becoming a bigger and bigger proportion of the inflow of investment, and possibly, in periods of **crisis** such as 1952-53, greatly exceeding it.

* 1 want to refer to two of these crises which have been blown up and one of which is almost past, because the press, like the political propagandists, stay with a **crisis** for a little while, then put it aside and it is forgotten.

* I suggest to the House that the housing **crisis** as a national issue will also be put aside in very much the same way as the coal **crisis** has virtually been put aside.

* I refer, in passing, to the **crisis** in the coal industry.

* That may produce a situation in which the individual workers in the industry, disturbed and displaced as they are, find themselves in a state of personal and individual **crisis**.

* If we were forced to depend on the sale in international markets of the products of our secondary industries we would be having an extremely thin time, and the debate we are having to-night would be in much more bitter terms, because there would indeed be a real national **crisis** in this country.

* one or two stormy meetings with members of the coal industry concerning this so-called **crisis**, to look at the figures.

* I believe the figure should be even higher, but how is the honorable member's figure reconciled with the statements of the Prime Minister and the Minister for National Development  (Senator Spooner)  who have both said there is no **crisis** in housing, implying, no doubt, that ample houses are being built to-day to meet the needs of the Australian community?

* On the following evening, I heard the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck),  in answer to an interjection made by an Opposition member, inquire whether Opposition members did not realize that we were dealing with an economic **crisis**.

* Japan is most strategically placed to-day, but is suffering a serious economic **crisis**.

* Secondly, the financial **crisis** in our economy forced the States, particularly the principal States, to reduce allocations of money for soldier settlement so that they would be able to continue other projects with which they were concerned, at the time.

* The appointment of a board with power to direct the Governor is a retrograde step, and is in keeping with the policy of past antir Labour administrations which only in times of national **crisis** such as war have been prepared to allow the Commonwealth Bank to remain under the sole control of.

* Now, when public confidence is an important factor in the economic **crisis**, the difference in the attitude of the two leaders who have spoken is notable.

* a year of **crisis**, the Labour party again has such a leader for the Australian people.

* particular **crisis** - by the Government's action to increase interest rates in this country.

* Sacrifices were called for by the governments of the day, Federal and State, which asked workers to remedy the **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister was opposed to the reduction of interest rates in the **crisis** of 1929 to 1932, but in the **crisis** which he says is now upon us in 1956 he is prepared, through his Treasurer, to bring pressure to hear on the Commonwealth Bank  to  increase the interest rate by from  per cent, to 1 per cent.

* If the Prime Ministor did not actually give such an instruction, he had sufficient assurance from the 
In regard to housing commission homes and in regard to everything that involves the expenditure of money for production purposes, either direct or indirect, for where it is not direct it is indirect, there will be a rise in prices that will accentuate the existing economic **crisis** in Australia.

* When the government faced a foreign and domestic **crisis**, the Communist party had established a leverage strong enough to threaten civil war.

* They think that it might be better to tie up ships now and bring all transport to a stop than to continue to tolerate intermittent stoppages I warn them that the precipitation of a **crisis** will not overcome industrial troubles.

* I desire to direct the attention of the right honorable Minister for External Affairs to the serious situation which confronts a British dependency, Malta, where, I believe, an initiative by Australia and the Australian Government might produce satisfactory results and the easing of a serious **crisis** - a result which would certainly be of benefit to the Commonwealth as a whole and to the people of Malta, who displayed such special and superb courage in the war that they received the unique honour of being decorated, as a people, by  His  late Majesty, King George VI., with the George Cross.

* I assure him that if he does so we on this side of the House will support every attempt to bring the **crisis** in Malta to an end on a basis of continuing membership of the Commonwealth by Malta, and on a basis of justice to its people as well as to the people of the United Kingdom.

* In view of the prevailing **crisis** in the programme for marketing Australian beef, has the Minister any information on the potential meat markets in far eastern countries where consumption is rapidly expanding?

* We have only the say-so of the Prime Minister about the international emergency which he asserts has arisen, but he asks the Parliament to give him a blank cheque to enable the Government to meet that **crisis**.

* While the dairying industry faces its present severe **crisis**, much greater assistance than that which is being given by the present Government is justified.

* In the course of debate on a matter of urgency in the House on Tuesday last, the Leader of the House informed honorable members that the Minister for Territories, upon his return from the Northern Territory, would make a statement concerning the **crisis** brought about by the resignation of all six elected members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council and the issues involved in those resignations.

* Although it is ten weeks since the Netherlands elections, the country is still without a stable Government to meet the impending **crisis**.

* Yet in the last few weeks, there has been a sudden campaign in some sections of the press and' elsewhere designed to convince the people that there is a housing **crisis**.

* That is why we refused to be stampeded into any **crisis** treatment of a problem which, more than any other, requires sober judgment and a clear understanding of the importance of not building too much false debt into the new home.

* It will suffice to show that talk of **crisis** and of slump is grossly exaggerated.

* I deny a **crisis**; I deny a slump.

* There is one thing on which the Opposition can agree with the right honorable gentleman, and that is that we are facing the greatest **crisis** in our history.

* They have now been in office for almost two years, and yet they admit that we are facing the greatest **crisis** in our history.

* One cannot but feel, after having heard the eloquent speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies),  the supporting speeches of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Chifley)  and the right honorable member for Barton  (Dr. Evatt)  and the statements on behalf of the Government by the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr. Spender)  and the Leader of the Australian Country 'party  (Mr. Fadden),  that the House should congratulate itself that in a time of great international **crisis** a united Australian approach has been made to the question now before it.

* brought about **crisis** after **crisis** in the affairs of nations, but in the face of those crises there were divided counsel and weakness.

* One  control"  gives  rise  to the  need  for  another control' audi  as  the controls multiply new  disequilibria  appear.- audi create an apparent need  for still,  more- controls ; crises  of  ever-growing intensity, occur, each in turn seeming to cry for direct government handling, which after an interval produces a- further- **crisis**.

* It is suggested, and undoubtedly is largely true, that the special circumstances of shortage of shipping arising from the Suez **crisis** enabled this profitable operation.

* However, there seems to be no doubt that Australia can earn freights in overseas trading, notwithstanding the Suez **crisis** and its effect on the availability of ships.

* We should make our position very much more clear than that because we are approaching a **crisis** in our Pacific relations.

* If he can gain control of Dutch New Guinea, in another **crisis**, Japanese imperialists or Chinese Communists might be given access to that territory and our national existence would then be gravely endangered.

* Soekarno would be a rotten reed on which to rely in any **crisis**.

* This was particularly true of that part of his speech that referred to the Suez Canal and the Middle East **crisis**.

* In the British House of Commons,  Mr. Gaitskell,  the putative and the likely Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the very near future, said that the only country that came out of the Suez **crisis** with clean hands was the United States.

* One would have thought that an economic **crisis** was imminent and that this country was in such a dire position that no concessions could be made to a long-suffering public.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Dr. Evatt)  has said that the budget does not contain any remedies or any plan to deal with the economic **crisis** that is apparent to all.

* But we know that it is action, not words, that is needed to overcome the economic **crisis**.

* The **crisis** reveals itself externally in our overseas funds.

* The economic **crisis** threatening Australia will remain until power is given to the National Parliament to correct it.

* Moreover, one of the great political parties in England was experiencing something approaching a political **crisis**, because of one woman and her husband coming into a situation where there were certain grievances, which they knew how to exploit.

* He goes on to state that that is exactly the analysis of imperialism that the Communists will never make, because they are practitioners  par excellence  of this drive for power, and every **crisis** in their political structure resolves itself finally into a struggle between the leaders of the two supreme points of power, at one stage the army and Beria.

* It is not the will of the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden)  that it is brought down, because we know his general attitude, since he played a prominent part in the establishment of these vital controls on banking during the great **crisis** of World War II., in association with  Mr. Chifley.

* Any attempt of the kind would obviously lead to a financial and banking **crisis**.

* The responsibility for the farming **crisis**- 
There was a **crisis** in 1930, but I have yet to learn that there is now a farming **crisis** -  lies squarely at the Government's door.

* In spite of that, the Leader of the Opposition says that responsibility for the " farming **crisis** " lies at the door of this Government.

* During the Suez Canal **crisis**, the Russian Government sent to the British Government a note specifically directing attention to the fact that Britain had no security against rockets with hydrogen warheads, and pointing out that it was not necessary even to transport such rockets by submarine or ship in order to launch an attack.

* The Prime Minister, at the outset, denied emphatically that there was a housing **crisis**.

* Perhaps the Prime Minister is of the opinion that there is no such thing as a **crisis**' until such time as there is chaos and misery and starvation such as occurred during the last depression which, after all, is not so many years back.

* If this is allowed to continue, we shall eventually have what the Prime Minister apparently chooses to regard as a **crisis**.

* The Opposition demands that something be done before a **crisis** has been reached, because it will be too late then to think about acting.

* The right honorable gentleman knows that the dollar **crisis** was so desperate for the members of the sterling  bloc  two or three years ago that it became essential for each of them to come to an agreement with the United Kingdom Government in respect of the demands that they would make upon that pool.

* The Chifley Labour Government, being prepared to play its part in assisting the United Kingdom in a period of desperate financial **crisis**, agreed to take certain definite steps to conserve dollar expenditure by the Commonwealth.

* The dollar **crisis** was exceedingly grave about two years ago, and the Chifley Labour Government adopted the proper policy of appointing a sub-committee of Cabinet to recommend means by which dollar expenditure might be conserved.

* Indeed, the improvement is so marked that it may he said with confidence that the United Kingdom has passed through the **crisis** in which it was involved, and, to that degree, the necessity for conserving dollars has been reduced.

* This all adds up to the uttermost **crisis** in human affairs.

* The present **crisis** of humanity must colour every question of international policy.

* Even in the greatest **crisis** of the war quarterly adjustment of wages .by reference to prices was the law of the land.

* I ask the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Treasurer, whether, in order to ease the rapidly a pproaching **crisis** in the poultry industry, be will kindly take steps to have a survey or a re-examination of costs in the industry carried out as expeditiously as possible.

* It is deplorable that such a housing **crisis** should have come about, but it has been coming for the last five or six years.

* Yet the Menzies Government and its representatives and supporters have the colossal effrontery to say that there is no **crisis**, and that everything will level itself out in a couple of years' time.

* Honorable gentlemen- opposite may malign-, if' they will, bis- name, and smear- his character, but we on this side of the- House, the working- class- move ment;, and the Labour, movement, throughout tha world,, know- of his; great achievements on behalf of this nation in the greatest **crisis** in- its- history: 
One can only be disappointed at the Minister's statement, which sounded like a very nice essay.

* **crisis** more immediately confronting the Australian people and the rest of the Western world.

* I say that the scheme that he has propounded here to-day would never have seen the light of day had not the Leader of the Opposition moved an amendment censuring the Government because of the housing **crisis** confronting this country.

* This is the first opportunity that the Labour party has had, after an almost record recess of four months, to draw the attention of the Government to the housing **crisis**, which it has apparently overlooked.

* The Prime Minister, in the worst speech that I have ever heard him make - and he has made a few bad ones - denied the existence of a housing **crisis**.

* The Minister for the Army  (Mr. Cramer)  admitted that there was a **crisis**, but blamed it on  the State Governments.

* Men are being dismissed in every section of the building industry, yet the Prime Minister says that there is no **crisis**.

* The honorable gentleman referred to the British Government's " mishandling of the Persian **crisis** " and to " the last vestiges of British influence in the Middle East ".

* I am advised that there is simply not enough wheat available in this country to feed our poultry and pig populations and that farmers are being advised, as the only solution to the **crisis**, to slaughter their flocks and herds.

* In view of the great **crisis** in the New South Wales poultry industry, has the Minister as yet agreed to any of the requests submitted by the delegation from that industry which met representatives of his department last week?

* What happened in rho **crisis** of World War II.?

* I claim that in the **crisis** of World War LT. the Australian Labour party leadership helped to save Australia from Japanese invasion, notwithstanding the neglect of the defence of Australia and its territories which characterized the previous administration.

* The doctrine that was propounded by Lenin, namely, that revolution was impossible without a nation-wide **crisis**, was subsequently endorsed and propagated by Stalin.

* The Jeremiahs opposite are suggesting that such results are only flashes in the pan which simply disguise the fact that a real **crisis** is looming.

* It refrained from doing so, because no central bank and no government would seek to cause a **crisis** in the banking industry.

* I readily admit that nothing could be more calculated to destroy a government than a deliberate act on its part to cause such a **crisis**.

* Experience in the past has shown that such a **crisis** would disrupt the whole economic life of the community.

* No government that desired to survive or to see the nation progress would take any .action that would tend to cause a **crisis** in banking.

* There was virtual silence on the question of foreign affairs, at a time when the world is in a state of **crisis**.

* Let him do so; but if he is accurate he will find - and I refer to the December, 1956, statistics - that the record of the Chifley Government, despite the enormous difficulties which had to be overcome in a period of shortages before the great **crisis** caused by the war had been entirely removed from the immediate economic scene, will stand comparison with the record of this Government.

* The real question is: What is to be done now, in this **crisis**?

* It is an indication of the course that the Government should follow to meet this **crisis**.

* Why, timber cannot be sold in many States of the 

 Mr. Speaker, the **crisis** in home building provides the clearest indication of the effect on the people of Australia of the Government's inflationary policy.

* But the **crisis**, if there is to be a **crisis** - and we all hope that there will not be - may come upon us quite suddenly.

* I do not know what the position is in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, although, from what I have heard about those States, I doubt very much whether there is in each of them the housing **crisis** that honorable gentlemen opposite would have us believe exists, but I do know that there is no such **crisis** in Western Australia.

* There is a **crisis**  throughout the 
I shall state the position in Western Australia as an example of how this false propaganda goes on.

* I have said that we have no housing **crisis** in Western Australia, but we have a couple of other crises.

* We have a railway **crisis**, and I hope that time will permit me to make some further reference to it.

* But we have also another **crisis** - the **crisis** of a government which falsely blames the Commonwealth for its own incapacity to do in Western Australia the job that the State electors put it into office to do.

* I have said that we had a **crisis** in Western Australia, and so we have.

* I am very glad to hear the honorable member say that, because I know that my presence here causes a **crisis** in the Opposition, and that the Opposition would, like to remove that **crisis**.

* The **crisis** in Western Australia is caused by our railways situation.

* I suggest that the people will not be deceived by it because, over the years, the Opposition has shown that it is more concerned about gaining advantage for its political party than in saving Australia in its **crisis**.

* The situation deteriorated more and more rapidly, until, just before the last Parliament went before the people, the Prime Minister in an economic statement to this House, pointed out that we were again in danger of overseas insolvency, that we were facing an economic blizzard, that a **crisis** was looming ahead.

* Honorable members will remember, too, that he told the representatives of private banking institutions that he desired them to restrict credit to all sections of the community, because it was the credit that the private banking institutions were issuing to the public that was causing the economic blizzard, or **crisis**, that existed at that particular time.

* The **crisis** exists to-day.

* The second thing that I think we ought to get rid of is the tax which has created a kind of **crisis**, upon which no comment will be made because it is sub judice - the poll tax in New Guinea.

* The Government ds transferring them to the Australian Capital Territory and creating a **crisis** in the private schools for parents who want to send their children to those schools.

* I think we should say quite unashamedly that if the Commonwealth Government is creating in this Territory a problem for parents, it should itself help to overcome the school **crisis** which it has created in this Territory more generously than it is helping at the moment.

* I am not a Catholic, but I think it is a question of simple justice for any sort of private school in the Territory that if, in the cities from which people are coming, they have had the habit, through their own convictions, of sending their children to private schools, and a **crisis** has been created by the transferring of population, the Government, whose policy is to transfer the population, should be prepared to pay to overcome the **crisis**.

* Whether he calls them margins for skill or payments to which they are rightly entitled I do not know, but certainly the explanation comes strangely from the mouth of the Treasurer, who is representing the Prime Minister, because during the last session he denied ordinary members an increase for the reason that the nation was facing some sort of economic **crisis**.

* The refusal of Jordan and the Lebanon to subjugate themselves to Egypt and Syria has been a major cause of the present **crisis**.

* It is a very great satisfaction to us to know that at this time of **crisis** the United Kingdom and the United States are standing firmly and confidently together - with some risk to themselves - in the face of threats to the integrity and independence of small nations.

* I hope that some time in the future - and not the distant future - the Parliament will be given the power to display a greater interest in local authorities so that these poor members of the governing bodies will not always be going through a period of financial **crisis**.

* to Labour to help it 0U of its difficulties, so in this economic **crisis** it will once again ask Labour t&lt;&gt; restore stable government and prosperity 
That suggestion opens up a very wide field for dis cussion.

* When the reconstruction training scheme petered out in 1950 the universities were faced with a great **crisis**.

* That money is being provided to meet a **crisis** which has been with us for some time, and is still with us.

* Why would the Government make extra allocations to the States, and municipal and semi-government institutions, if there were not a **crisis**?

* It is true to say that progress cannot be stopped, because development and progress go hand in hand; but it is another matter to turn a blind eye to apparent deficiencies and, by inaction, allow things to drift until a **crisis** appears.

* Speakers on the Government side have gone to some length to justify the meagre amounts allowed to meet this **crisis**.

* I use the word " **crisis** " purposely because, as I said in the first place, if a **crisis** had not been with us, it would not have been necessary for the Government to take the action that it did.

* How can Australia escape this menace unless the Government is prepared to come to grips with our economic problems in a far more realistic manner than that in which it is dealing with the **crisis** facing the nation at the present time?

* In other words, this restriction of finance has created a **crisis** in education.

* The **crisis** to which the attention of this Government must be directed to-day arises from the need to cater for the rapidly increasing school population.

* The Government should, in the interests of Australia, try to meet the **crisis** and guarantee to those engaged in the industry that the harder they work and the more they produce their efforts will be rewarded.

* It should meet the present **crisis** by making the promises to this industry that the honorable member for Lalor has made.

* Unless there is a profound change in world conditions or unless there is increased consumption of butter in this country I think that a **crisis** is due for the industry.

* What is the Government doing to meet this **crisis**?

* He has done so on every occasion when he has faced a **crisis**.

* There was the recent attempt to manufacture a **crisis** out of the defensive mea sures which Turkey took inside her own borders.

* The **crisis** subsided in the face of unexpected developments such as King Saud's constructive offer to mediate, which did not suit Soviet plans, and the lukewarm hearing which the Syrian allegations received in the United Nations General Assembly.

* The **crisis** in the dairy industry to which the honorable member for EdenMonaro has referred is not so serious as he has stated it to be.

* It forecast sound, constructive proposals for the re-organization of departments, trade drives and export payment schemes to meet the possibility of an economic **crisis**.

* Yet, during the last nineteen months, the Government has not done anything to prevent the development of an economic **crisis** or a series of crises in Australia in such matters as population under the Holt plan, in rural industries, in industrial relations and in credit.

* Until this delegation returns and makes its report, and we know what the organization's views are, it would, in my opinion, be an act of impertinence on the part of the Government, except in the face of some overwhelming and sudden **crisis** such as a war, to say, " We do not care what your views are; we know better than you do ".

* In my experience I have sten no more helpless creature in a **crisis** than an untrained soldier or one equipped with a weapon of defence that he does not know how to use.

* It is essential, if we are to form valid judgments on the Suez Canal **crisis** to begin by getting our facts right.

* This high-handed, and as I believe, illegal action, produced a world **crisis**.

* Such people ignored, and ignore, the two salient operative facts: 
I do not myself object to the precautionary steps announced by the Prime Minister to-day; I think that any Government would have to do that, as we had to do it during the Persian **crisis**.

* It was said by some that, when the **crisis** arose after Colonel Nasser's nationalization decree, the whole matter should have at once been taken to the United Nations.

* But those negotiations would have been conducted in an atmosphere which was not one of **crisis**, and sensible and fair conclusions might well have been arrived at without the development of heated views on " sovereignty " - which is one of the words - and " collective colonialism " - which is one of the phrases.

* If so, will the Prime Minister explain how it was that, on many successive days after the Middle East **crisis** arose, not a single Minister was in the National Capital?

* The programme that it contained, taking it as a Government programme, must have been disappointing to many of the Government's supporters as well as to the nation because it showed a lack of awareness of the acute domestic **crisis** which at present is mounting in every direction.

* That **crisis** is evidenced by the rapidly growing lack of confidence in government securities to which the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden)  referred at the meeting of the Loan Council held earlier this week.

* Inflation is the key to the whole internal **crisis** in this country.

* First, there is the energy, or power, **crisis**.

* The second **crisis** to which I refer might be described as the rural **crisis** which is fast developing.

* The Government has not given any indication at all of how it proposes to meet the rural **crisis**.

* I turn now to the population **crisis** which is closely allied with the rural **crisis**.

* If the Government remains passive in this matter, the food **crisis** must become worse and, at the same time, the housing position will be gravely worsened.

* Next, there is the rapidly developing credit **crisis** which is apparent from statements that the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden)  made earlier this week.

* That is an artificial **crisis** and- it seems to have been caused by a misdirected central bank policy at the direction of the Government.

* I have dealt with the power **crisis**, the rural **crisis**, the population **crisis** and what I call the credit **crisis**, and I shall say a few words about the industrial **crisis**, which is partly due to a failure to understand bona fide trade unionism, and what it stands for.

* The mission of the Labour party in this Parliament will be to see that the Government does not evade any of its responsibilities, and that positive and remedial action, rather than merely repressive action, shall be taken to deal with the economic **crisis** that is threatening not only wage earners and salary earners, but also, and particularly, persons in receipt of pensions or on fixed incomes.

* Yet the National Parliament, in a moment of economic **crisis**, has no power to control capital issues, profits, prices or interest rates!

* The value of the Australian 1 now is as low as it ever was at any time of **crisis** from 1870 and 1890, through to 1929.

* A **crisis** has developed in relation to primary and secondary education.

* So let me say that in any national **crisis**, whether it be a major **crisis** or a minor **crisis**, we have a responsible element in the community and we have an irresponsible element.

* His  approach is reminiscent of events in 1952, when we were experiencing another minor **crisis**, and when the Opposition set out to exploit the nation's distress for its own political advantage.

* Where is its sense of responsibility in regard to unemployment, the housing **crisis**, and the associated deterioration of the health of age pensioners and young families who are forced to live in slum conditions in humpies, shacks, tents, and garages throughout Australia?

* The great economic **crisis** is not confined to Australia, and this should cause so-called responsible members of the Government to apply themselves with great vigour to this problem.

* The only proposals by the Government to combat the **crisis** appear laudable at first, but become laughable upon reflection.

* The Minister for National Development  (Senator Spooner)  stood by, sphinx-like, immobile, firm and useless, at the time of **crisis**.

* Our vital public hospitals cannot be left to flounder from **crisis** to **crisis**.

* They are demanding that something more than eloquence should be our shield in Australia's hour of **crisis**.

* He has said that an amendment of the kind now before the House is usually supposed to precipitate a **crisis**.

* The Opposition has submitted its amendment because events in Australia are rapidly moving towards an actual **crisis**.

* When people were being invited to subscribe to the new loan I listened to a broadcast by the  Australian  Broadcasting Commission in Sydney in which the adviser of the Government,  Sir Douglas  Copland, speaking at an important conference, said that we were facing an economic **crisis**.

* It is not enough that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  (Mr. McEwen)  should recognize the **crisis** in this industry and be willing to do justice to the dairy farmers.

* I know that he recognizes the **crisis** and is willing to do justice to the industry.

* I know that the Minister recognizes the nature of the **crisis** and the need for action, because he has already told the farmers that.

* The most obvious symptom of the **crisis** in the industry is the acceleration of the drift away from the production of butter fat into other more profitable primary industries.

* Certainly the **crisis** in the industry cannot be met merely by the result of the annual cost survey of the industry which is now proceeding.

* If it had put value back into the fi, as it undertook to do, the present **crisis** in the dairying* industry would not be so acute.

* But measures of that kind - I have named only a few of them- - will not cope with the present **crisis** in the industry.

* For many weeks, the Minister has had before him a recommendation from responsible leaders of the industry that the present **crisis** should be recognized by the introduction of a system of special incentive payments to dairy-farmers over and above the findings of the Joint Dairying Industry Advisory Committee, and that those special payments should remain in force until the.

* To-day he told the story that by virtue of this alleged **crisis** and of the time element involved - it might be three, six or nine months before the legal processes could be gone through - an accused person must be denied the elementary rights of justice.

* If a **crisis** is upon us to-day, and if the country is in immediate danger, surely it behoves the Government to inform the people of the country of the nature of the **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister desires to deprive citizens of elementary justice on the plea that Australia is facing a **crisis**.

* From what quarter does that **crisis** threaten?

* That hysteria is not caused by an international **crisis**.

* I warn the Government that there will be militants in the trade unions, regardless of any **crisis** that this country may face, and that they will cause industrial disturbances if they are provoked, and have justification.
