* I say again - I think it is worth repeating - that just prior to the regrettable **revolution** in Chile about 750,000 workers rose in rebellion at one public meeting.

* There is only one way that that ripple of insecurity, almost of **revolution**, can be removed; this Government should go to the people.

* Many commentators have referred to what is going on nowadays as the second industrial **revolution**.

* Anyone wilh any knowledge of history will know about the horrors of the first industrial **revolution** and how human beings were depersonalised into what were called 'factors of production'.

* It was the degradation of humanity as a result of the first industrial **revolution** under early capitalism that gave rise to the flowering of Socialist thinking throughout Western Europe and caused the rise of the great Socialist movements in Western Europe in the 19th century.

* I think it is no accident that in this second industrial **revolution** there is an increasing advocacy of greater participation in management and control of industry by the workers and by the community.

* An end to the principle that the US alliance is crucial, and a beginning of support for the "human rights' **revolution** around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements.

* He saw indexation as part of a plot to achieve a subtle **revolution** in Australia- a remarkable assertion.

* If in fact ASIO has succeeded in saving this country from subversion and **revolution** in the last 30 years then somebody on the other side ought to be able to get up and timidly squeak out some evidence.

* There is one account of the Conseil du Roi in France which started in the thirteenth century, was overthrown in the 1789 **revolution** and replaced by the Conseil d 'Etat.

* At that time there was quite a **revolution** both in shipping and on the waterfront, particularly with the advent of roll-on roll-off ferries instead of the conventional type of shipping.

* Back in the old days of the 1 890s trade unions had to be formed to get some rights for the workers and back in the Industrial **Revolution** in the early 1 820s something had to be done to get children out of the mines.

* It was no one else but  Dr Jim  Cairns himself, the author of 'The Quiet **Revolution**' and the man who undoubtedly is pledged to the maximum of his capacity while he is in his present position to socialise Australian industry.

* This is what he said about the Hungarian **revolution** - 
Workers' control demands and tactics as outlined above provide a testing ground today for even greater challenges in the coming years to the power of capitalism and its State machine.

* They provide a testing ground for what a **revolution** in advanced capitalist countries means- the taking-over by the mass of workers of their workplaces, of social and cultural institutions, and finally of the whole of society and the State.

* The House can judge how far this movement towards a state of **revolution** has already gone by what happened last Friday when the Minister responsible for the generation of power in New South Wales was refused normal admission to a power station by a mob of power workers who were perhaps not technically on strike but who were having a consistent program of go slow.

* If they do not, the people will leave the industry anyway because there has been a dramatic **revolution** in the European countryside in terms of the way of life.

* **Revolution** isn't going to come without an armed struggle.

* With that diminished capacity to predict future trends, the Government has just stumbled on the fact that Australia is on the verge of a technological **revolution** which carries immense consequences for the manufacturing base in this country.

* I can remember the days when he lectured me at Melbourne University on economic history, about the trade union movement and the industrial **revolution**.

* In the early 1800s the French **Revolution** caused the English ruling class to have a special fear of organised labour.

* For threequarters of a century this nation has survived as one of the minority of countries throughout the world which have not suffered from upheaval as a result of **revolution** or an attempt at armed overthrow of the Government.

* If the Government does that it will not be **revolution** that it will bring about in this country; it will bring about the secession of the weaker States who must have representation in the Senate in order to be able to exercise some of their authority.

* If there was a **revolution** in Australian society it was the product of the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme.

* Is it possible for the funds to be used for other purposes, such as **revolution**, wars of national liberation, terrorism or guerilla activities in other countries.

* I quote from a document titled  Communist Rules for **Revolution**  which was written in 1919 and which lists the 4 basic rules as: 
What their leaders are doing is trying to bring about what they call a revolutionary situation.

* This is a rehearsal for **revolution**.

* I do not wish to make out that the plans for **revolution** have gone any further than in point of fact they have.

* Then there is the problem of what is known as the green **revolution** which has swept over Europe and America, and is now sweeping over Asia, where new types of crops, particularly wheat and rice, have increased tremendously the yield potential.

* The green **revolution** does therefore have a potential backlash and it may be that this will call on Australian farmers once again to start feeding the hungry East.

* I simply do not believe that anything constructive can result from this urgency motion by the generation of fear or distortion of facts, nor will anything be achieved by members of the Country Party attempting to foment a rural **revolution**.

* At present, the factors for both **revolution** and war are increasing.

* The Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr McEwen)  announced 3 years ago that containerisation was to bring about a **revolution** in shipping, resulting in cheaper freights and cost-free feeder services from outports, but one of the major ports in Western Australia is still waiting for some definite word from this Government as to what containerisation is going to mean to it.

* Will the Prime Minister assure the House that the Government will take urgent steps to stop this rural, economic and social **revolution**?

* I am very proud indeed to be the supporter of a government that for the first time intends to have a scientific look at the question of industrial relations and not just treat it in the way that it has been treated ever since the industrial **revolution** in Britain.

* It is one of the views which such a party has been expressing since the industrial **revolution** of the last century.

* It is strangely reminiscent of the circumstances that have occurred in Paris time and time again during the course of France's history, when one republic has been overthrown by **revolution** and replaced by another.

* The citizens of Paris occupied the streets to change their government by **revolution**.

* The increased allocation is timely because the great social **revolution** of the post-war years is being reversed.

* The internal problems of the cultural **revolution** took toll of his health and he came through that **revolution** in the same position as Premier of that country.

* To allow to develop a situation in which we are vulnerable to **revolution** and changes of government in other parts of the world or to an OPEC-type operation in relation to the price of rock phosphate could mean that Australian users of rock phosphate and, in turn, the farmers who use superphosphate and other phosphatic fertilisers will have to pay exorbitant prices.

* If honourable members want a comparison let me deal with Chile where the great **revolution** took place and where the great copper mining industry of that nation was brought to its knees because suddenly the expertise disappeared, the incentive disappeared.

* On the contrary, the position quite obviously is that in mainland China for quite normal commercial reasons there have been a number of circumstances which have certainly reduced that country's need to buy wheat this year, lt is true that the green **revolution** is not confined to India, Pakistan or the other countries of South East Asia.

* The green **revolution** has meant that through the use of fertilisers and the use of rapidly growing and high yielding Mexican wheats there is a very substantial increase in production in a great part of Asia, and China has not, of course, been outside that.

* The learned people on the government side who read selectively should read  Anatomy of a **Revolution**  by 
Huberman and Sweezy.

* Before the **revolution** hook-worms were found to be slithering from the mouths and noses of little children.

* We are to carry out a **revolution** in the Australian National University.

* Regarding the 'Marsellaise', as has already been said, it arose from the circumstances of the French **Revolution**.

* It was composed by an artillery officer in a French division from Marseilles fighting against the invaders of France after the **Revolution**.

* Prior to the Russian **revolution**, 80 per cent to 85 per cent of the people were illiterate.

* They realise what they have achieved in 50 years, over coming an 85 per cent illiteracy rate, having suffered 2 world wars and having been cut off from the entire world for 7 years after their **revolution**.

* What was found after the successful **revolution** of Fidel Castro - a Jesuit who had a very strict upbringing and was reared in the teaching order of the Roman Catholic church?

* After the **revolution** it was actually found that there were 650,000 permanently unemployed in a population of 6) million.

* Public policy in Australia supports the automotive **revolution** through extensive outlays on streets, highways and freeways.

* India has also done extraordinarily well under the much publicised green **revolution**.

* It has been suggested that because of the green **revolution** there is no need in future to worry about possible grain sales to India.

* It is the sort of **revolution** that we on this side of the House do not want and it is the sort of **revolution** that the people of Australia, if they knew about it, would not want.

* Opposition understood somewhat more what he was talking about, because to define our country into 3 geographical areas of that kind totally ignores the functional integration between city centres and suburban areas - the whole process of urbanism and urban living which is now world wide, begun in a thorough going modern way in the 19th century with the industrial **revolution** in Britain and has now spread to this country almost as much as to any other.

* The change in technology and in the character of shipping that is necessarily part and parcel of the transport **revolution** which we see about us will obviously bring about changes in docking requirements.

* This is clearly a major **revolution** in the protection of the wheat industry.

* This proposal is a major **revolution** in the protection of wheat growers' incomes against fluctuating prices.

* He then said: 
-Did the Minister for Post and Telecommunications hear the radio program  AM  on 10 October in which it was reported that Peter McLullan, President of the Young Lawyers Association of Victoria, and Neil McLean, former national leader of the Australian student movement, broadcast from China to Thailand calling for continued communist **revolution** in Thailand?

* Does he consider that the electronics industry may have a special technological significance in the present industrial **revolution** equal to that of steel in the first industrial **revolution**?

* It could sow the seeds of violent **revolution** in a few years time.

* The cultural **revolution** had an enormous effect within China in a number of areas.

* Since the finish of the cultural **revolution** Chinese leadership has attempted to get things back on an even keel.

* It is reported that the green **revolution** has made China almost self sufficient in grain production.

* How silly it would be to suggest that their green **revolution** has been so successful that they could cut off all their imports from Australia.

* The scare diplomacy of China in the 1960s was expressed by Premier Chou En-lai in 1961 when he said that Africa was ripe for **revolution**.

* This concern is now being replaced by the long term diplomacy of a more settled China; of cooperation with friendly governments, irrespective of ideology, lt is apparent therefore that this scare diplomacy which emanated from China during the middle 1960s and in particular at the time of the cultural **revolution** is changing, which is not surprising because the cultural **revolution** was the greatest disaster China has faced, lt is my contention that China has a vital interest in ensuring that the Russians do not gain a dominant presence in the Indian Ocean and this is primarily the motivating factor in her relationships and the seeking of a detente as it would be with the Western world.

* They portend a real social and economic **revolution** of the same or greater proportions than the industrial **revolution** of the nineteenth century.

* There has been an agricultural **revolution** in this country by the addition of these fertilisers to the pastures.

* This is a matter of great regret to me personally as a person from the city, because it is only since the Industrial **Revolution** that most of us have been in the cities.

* Under the aegis of the National Library Act we look to the rapid and co-operative evolution of library and information services in Australia to cope with the information explosion and the technological **revolution** in the handling of information.

* It makes one wonder whether we are facing another **revolution** here.

* The Minister for Overseas Trade, in 'The Quiet **Revolution**', makes it plain that he wants to alter the system, to destroy stability and to destroy the savings of retired people and the assets of farmers and small businesses- of anyone who has a stake in this country.

* An economic crisis would then be created which  Dr Cairns  makes plain in the document is the ground work for **revolution**.

* In May of 1919 at Dusseldorp Germany, the Allied Forces obtained a copy of some of the 'Communist Rules for **Revolution**'.

* It referred to a second front against reaction following on moral **revolution**.

* In order to make a **revolution** and to fight a people's war and be victorious, it is imperative to adhere to the policy of self-reliance, rely on the strength of the masses in one's own country and prepare to cany on the fight independently even when all material aid from outside is cut off.

* If one does not operate by one's own efforts, does not independently ponder and solve the problems of the **revolution** in one's own country and does not rely on the strength of the  mases,  but leans wholly on foreign aid- 
The Australian public has the right to expect a much higher standard of behaviour from its Federal parliamentarians.

* The **revolution** that saw the creation of the great nation and republic of the United States of America was sparked by a tea party at Boston over 200 years ago.

* I have in my hand a book entitled The Quiet **Revolution**' written by James Ford Cairns, the Minister for Overseas Trade.

* Change is slow and the **revolution** is quiet.

* According to  Mr Serong  the **revolution** in Cambodia has given the Americans and the Thieu Government an undreamed of opportunity to end the war in 6 months.

* Our right to determine the nature of Vietnamese society will no more be accepted than has foreign intervention in any other **revolution**.

* Intervention in a **revolution**, whether American, French or Russian, is a classic formula for failure.

* The evidence is now conclusive that living standards in these countries will not rise significantly unless there are political and national changes there that amount, in fact, to a national **revolution**.

* If we had set out 70 years ago to do only what foreign competition allowed us to do, we would now probably have no more than 8 million or 9 million people and by this time we may well have had a **revolution** caused by depressions and their resultant social conflict.

* This is a philosophy of a simple, rural individualism, before the onset of the industrial **revolution** of the first half of 19th century Britain.

* Do we think that we have a state of **revolution** in this country which the British do not have?

* There is the assumption that mankind would carry out the social **revolution** demanded, that underdeveloped nations would not aim to reach our levels and that those in our society who already consider themselves close to subsistence level would join with the affluent in reducing their consumption.

* That attitude, or that assertion, died soon after the industrial **revolution**.

* The tertiary education assistance scheme will start next year and, as the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  has said, it is part of the Government's **revolution** of access to education.

* The notion that social levels should reflect differences in innate ability rather than differences in family was part of the democratic **revolution** which accompanied industrialisation.

* In a very short space of time we have seen a **revolution** in this field.

* The development in the whole ambit of tourism is a consequence of an enormous **revolution**.

* But the important point is that free trade economics went out with the industrial **revolution**.

* Either there is a fantastic **revolution** on the horizon for education, something that no other industrial state has contemplated before, or else, if that statement is true, wc must be a long way behind right now.

* I refer to what is known overseas especially and what will be known here as the 'cassette **revolution**', in which great technological developments will take place.

* The technological **revolution** has freed most women from the heaviest of domestic work, and while most - not all - feel they ought still to be home with their families while they are young, many have been well educated for a non-domestic vocation or, in fact, for a career occupation.

* There cannot be a dramatic **revolution** and few would want one.

* As one of the founders of the Constitution said, there is a very thin line between what is right and **revolution**.

* The classic example is the French **Revolution**.

* and a beginning of support for the human rights' **revolution**, around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements.

* But we are now launching ourselves on what might be called part of the Australian educational **revolution**.

* Port Jackson was an ideal, sheltered deep sea port and with the rapid expansion of railways- bearing in mind that this country was settled and developed after the Industrial **Revolution**- Sydney became the hub of a quite sophisticated transport system.

* I would not mind sitting as they did in the days of the French **Revolution**, when the Legislative Assembly was in constant session.

* I do not condone the recent **revolution** one bit, but long before the **revolution** 750,000 workers in Chile demanded the end of the Allende regime.

* After all, the biggest **revolution** which has taken place, and it is a very efficient change if one looks at the expense ratio, is that the insurance companies have gone into the superannuation business rather than the old form of endowment and term policies.

* The Islamic **revolution**- if we might refer to the events in Iran in that manner- has occurred.

* It is not so much a revival- this intense Islamic faith has always been there- as the use of the faith to ferment a **revolution** which could well spread right through to our own shores.

* I think it most likely would come back divided 30-30 and the Labor Party would not have the vital 31 votes which it needs for **revolution**.

* Yes, for **revolution**, not because honourable members opposite are revolutionary individually, although some of them may be, but because they are being directed by a revolutionary body outside this Parliament.

* Without money the Industrial **Revolution** could not have occurred.

* There is a vast potential for effect upon our economy and upon our whole system if the world economy changes to the extent that it could change if the monetary backing for international trading agreements becomes a gold-backed rouble rather that the British pound, or more recently the American dollar- the backing which has existed since the time of the Industrial **Revolution**.

* The trouble with ali this planning is that it fails to dovetail trends in various sectors and fails to make provision for the training of efficient planners, so creating a bottleneck in the supply of the sort of people who can understand and apply the knowledge **revolution** about planning and forecasting techniques that has taken place in the rest of the world in the 1960s.

* Has any request been made to the People's Republic of China concerning the broadcasts beamed to South East Asia, known under the name of  The Voice of Thailand  and  Radio Suara Revolusi Malaya- the Voice of Malayan **Revolution**.

* If so, has a request been made that these broadcasts cease promoting insurrection and **revolution**, when was the request made and under what circumstances.

* Another feature which concerns the Opposition is the **revolution** (hat has taken place in the carriage of freight.

* This **revolution** has had a widespread effect on the waterfront today.

* Every country believes in the **revolution** of rising expectations - and why not?

* But honourable members opposite are like Aneurin Bevan who once said about his political opponents that they are in favour of every **revolution** except the next one.

* It can now be clearly seen that the aim of the socialist left is to destroy arbitration, to work hard for collective bargaining, to produce chaos and anarchy and then **revolution**.

* Some recent clues, however, suggest that the Labor Party now sees socialism not simply as economic reform but as a **revolution** in our social and cultural values.

* Would he support such a demonstration by a protest movement or a moratorium if one were to be organised in Australia, or does he agree with the delegate at the Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American **Revolution** who said: 'Subversive elements plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them'?

* Labor's **revolution** covered a number of fields.

* All the programs that have been initiated by this Government are symptoms of the great **revolution** that is taking place in educational philosophy.

* Anyone who has been closely associated with schools, as J have, cannot but be aware of the **revolution** taking place in curriculum development.

* As to the second point raised by the honourable gentleman, that is, that three countries, Pakistan, India and Indonesia, because of the green **revolution** that has occurred in those countries, no longer have any necessity for wheat, I point out to him that not only have they a necessity for it, but they are importing it now because they need it in order to feed their hungry millions.

* The clear lesson of the Industrial **Revolution** has been that where men are naive enough to believe that they can pit themselves against machines they have always lost.

* Our technological **revolution** which has taken man to the moon and into space has brought with .it fundamental changes in our lifestyle.

* ls it also a fact that all members of this Branch will be photographed and screened and that their portraits will be filed in the archives of the Australian  Security  Intelligence Organisation to be turned up when the **revolution** comes?

* Despite the provocation of statements, such as those made by the honourable member for Kennedy, we should not underestimate the significance of the religious components in Iran's current **revolution**.

* With regard to Iran, the religion infrastructure and the very nature of the particular denomination of Islam practised in Iran have set the foundations for the **revolution**.

* However, I stress one point in the Iranian **revolution** which concerns Australia and that is that the Australian Government's decision to tie the country's petrol prices to world parity could not have been more ill-timed.

* That was a time when to be a member of this House was to participate in something of significance, to be part of a minor **revolution**.

* It may well be, as the honourable member suggests, that electronics technology in this industrial **revolution** is of equal importance to steel in the first indus'trial **revolution**.

* I believe he said 'On with the **revolution**'.

* As honourable members would know, this book readily became a capitalist declaration of independence from the remaining shackles of feudalism and helped to launch an economic **revolution** that has produced far more wealth than man had amassed in all previous history.

* Time  magazine states: 
Yet today the heirs of that **revolution** cannot celebrate in triumph.

* Australia has been through a **revolution** during the last few days.

* It may have been a bloodless **revolution** but it was a **revolution**'.

* It was he who stated: 'Yes, there is no doubt about it, Australia has been through a **revolution** in the last few days'.

* This is especially true in the period since 1971, the period since the microchip **revolution**, where there is a complete break in relationship between the level of output which is able to rise exponentially while the employment and other significant inputs are able to fall exponentially.

* from my submission 'Implications of a Post Industrial or Post Service **Revolution** on the Nature of Work' which I presented to the Myers committee on technological change in Australia.

* Congenital optimists are inclined to assert that technological change in the 1970s does not differ significantly in its impact from any other period since the Industrial **Revolution** began.

* There are seven basic differences between Europe's situation during the Industrial **Revolution** and the problems of finding alternative employment in the Post Industrial or Post Service **Revolution**.

* The Industrial **Revolution** was marked by: 
The Post-Industrial **Revolution** is marked by: 
I would like to deal briefly with this problem because it is most important to reconstruction in Queensland.

* With the siratro and setaria pastures there is a **revolution** going on in some of these areas which previously were pronounced marginal dairy farms and which will remain marginal dairy farms until we can get some semblance of sanity in the Queensland Government by its accepting positive and sound schemes like these.

* That is the kind of **revolution** they are bringing about.

* Owing to the inability of the green **revolution** to raise agricultural output at a faster rate than population output there will be a worsening food grain deficit in the whole region by 1985.

* Secondly, the hope that the effects of the green **revolution** and economic growth in the towns would percolate down to the poor now seems mistaken.

* I think that we have to confess that today the objective conditions for **revolution** exist across much of Asia.

* As the Survey points out, the objective conditions for **revolution** are now being given subjective awareness: 
With the advent of the Whitlam Government in 1972 the people of western Sydney saw an improvement in their society.

* The doubling of the education budgets in 1973 and 1974 and the subsequent distribution of the funds made available under those budgets on a real needs basis under the Karmel report saw an amazing **revolution** in the ordinary state schools- the parochial schools in Parramatta where the bulk of the children go.

* Our basic manpower policies have not changed since the industrial **revolution**.

* We all know what happened in little Cuba when its **revolution** displeased its northern neighbour.

* Finally, I leave China with a statement made by one of its former prominent leaders after the **Revolution**, Liu Shao-chi.

* A Bill such as the Broadcasting and Television Bill carries overtones which reflect the importance of this tremendous field of modern mass communications - a field in which a **revolution** is only beginning to be felt in Australia.

* As we look ahead from those days to the days of the pocket size transistor and tomorrow to colour television in Australia, to pocket television, to very mobile telecommunications in the keeping of the individual, it is undoubtedly true that a tremendous **revolution** in this whole field is only beginning.

* As one looks at the field one must .be aware that this **revolution** means that a completely different base to society is beginning to develop - that there are new powers for the manipulation of society; that there is a sophistication in terms of the presentation of material over the media which has to be scrutinised and understood not only by governments, educators and those who seek to benefit financially or commercially from these things but primarily by the great mass of people who are so often the victims of mass communications.

* I have stated before that one of the good things about the Telecom Australia dispute was that it brought to the fore and to the notice of the public the fact that the second industrial **revolution** was not around the corner but was upon us.

* This industrial **revolution**, of course, was brought about by computerisation.

* This is the second industrial **revolution** and it has to be grappled with.

* The present regime in China possesses a fanatical conviction in some sort of dream world Communist Utopia where all nations achieve the purity of Maoist thoughts by internal **revolution**.

* It believes in the concept of ultimate Communist world domination through local wars of national liberation achieved through a condition of world **revolution** and the acts of violence committed at Moratorium demonstrations, university sit-ins, etc, to which I have been personally subjected and which arc the local manifestation of Maoism in action.

* Like the Chinese, the Soviets believe in the doctrine of permanent world **revolution**, but unlike the Chinese, the Soviets are committed to a traditional policy of Russian colonialism which makes the former great colonial powers look positively benign.

* While covertly observing the doctrine of permanent world **revolution**, the Soviet also overtly pursues one of 'peaceful coexistence' so that we see her piously coexisting with the United States and other western powers and.

* A Budget designed to soak the poor to benefit the rich ought to cause a **revolution**.

* This, of course, would be subject to the good will of both sides, and that good will cannot be guaranteed if on the trade union side there are officials who are not trying to help their men, such as by getting them better conditions, but are trying to organise disruption as a plan for some kind of incipient **revolution**.

* Regrettably comments have been made from time to time by insignificant back benchers, also on the left wing of Australian politics, urging **revolution** and urging people to take mass action when the parliamentary process did not come out as they expected.

* I believe they are remarks which could involve the urging of mass uprising, **revolution** in the streets, and the total destruction of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law in this country.

* It is potential **revolution**.

* I say they are unpatriotic to the extent that they involve an attempt to break down the parliamentary system in this country and to replace it with street rabble **revolution**.

* That newspaper said that he was talking about 'anti-democratic **revolution**' and was advocating the first step towards a totalitarian regime.

* Was he saying that between each 3- yearly democratic election we should gather in little groups or big groups, that we should go into the streets, that we should preach violence and **revolution**, and that we should white-ant - 
How right he is,  Mr Speaker.

* If he does neither the judgment of Australia will be that the Australian Labor Party has as its  Deputy  Leader a man who would countenance mass action, physical violence, coming out in the streets and preaching **revolution**.

* In another draft paper for the Communist Party Congress on 'Aims' etc., there was this: The communists aim for socialist **revolution** without civil war.

* Dr J.  F. Cairns, in his book in 1972 titled 'The Quiet **Revolution**', stated: 
**Revolution** in an advanced capitalist country can become a possibility only if there is a serious economic crisis.

* I conclude my contribution to the Budget debate by saying that the Labor Government has created that serious economic crisis and that there are some people in the trade union movement with political beliefs of a communist philosophy who are exploiting it to the utmost to bring about that quiet **revolution** and to destroy free enterprise in this country so that a climate is created where ALP socialism will be the only alternative because private enterprise will no longer be.

* Chilean **revolution**.

* It requires of everyone who is going to take part, a lot of self-questioning, a lot of learning, and in many cases, a sort of internal **revolution**.

* If the Government is planning  to  settle industrial disputes by forcing the bg battalions simply  to  bash it out against the employers - tearing down private property, resorting to arson, destruction, physical violence and **revolution** then I can only say they have forgotten that the French **Revolution**, the American **Revolution** and the Russian **Revolution** started because a few people in seats of power did not realise that right under their noses a **revolution** was erupting and could not see that when people were crying out for bread they could not be satisfied by being given cake when there was no cake to give them.

* I do not think that people should lose sight of the fact that after promising a **revolution** to restore the pride, confidence and strength of the Chinese empire, Chiang Kai-shek first turned the machine guns on the striking workers in Shanghai in the early 1920s- workers who had struck to facilitate his takeover of the country- then proceeded to collaborate with the very people who had been responsible for the destruction and subjection of China for so long.

* The **revolution** succeeded because it was able to attract the confidence and patriotic support of the Chinese people.

* Industries Development Association bulletin - is that we are living in a period of technological change, and one of the tragedies is that we are still training people to do jobs that are not wanted and we are not training people to do jobs that the technological **revolution** demands.

* Although the situation on Zanzibar has been less dear, the present leadership there, as  President  Nyerere indicated during his visit, is seeking to counter the worst effects of a violent **revolution** and reactions to years of abuse which stemmed from foreign domination including the slave traffic centred on the island of Zanzibar.

* (a) It is estimated that about 5,000 persons died on Zanzibar during the **revolution** of January 1964, mounted by both Africans and Arabs against the Sultan's Government.

* It is interesting to quote here from a book entitled 'The Quiet **Revolution** ' written by  Dr Cairns,  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, in 1972.

* He wrote: 
**Revolution** in an advanced capitalist country can become a possibility only if there is a serious economic crisis.

* In my maiden speech on 23 February I spoke about the Post Industrial **Revolution**' or, to use two alternative names, the 'Post Service **Revolution**' or the 'Information Society'.

* This development occurred at the time of the industrial **revolution**.

* But, out of respect for you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I will not proceed on this point although I would have liked to have shown how the concept of cities of great mass emanated from the industrial **revolution**.

* We have to understand the changing nature of the information **revolution**.

* The situation that the honourable member for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon)  forgets is that there has been a **revolution** in urban and regional affairs.

* This Bill, together with complementary legislation, which gives assistance to students, is part of a conscious and deliberate policy of this Government to produce - these are the Minister's words - a **revolution** of access to education.

* As stated at the beginning of my remarks, the aim of this Government is to produce a **revolution** of access to education.

* When questioned as to what changes this would bring if it occurred, the honourable member replied that the ALP policy would be changed to bring an end to the principle that the United States alli ance is crucial and that there would be  a  beginning of support for the human rights **revolution** around the world, more often expressed in the national liberation movements.

* As a revolutionary thinker Mao made unique contributions to the theory and practice of **revolution**.

* He merged the cause of national liberation with the goal of social **revolution** to overthrow the Chinese ruling class.

* He developed the idea of the continuing nature of **revolution**.

* In the cultural **revolution** he alerted the Chinese **revolution** and all social revolutions to the dangers of the re-emergence of the ruling cliques or classes.
