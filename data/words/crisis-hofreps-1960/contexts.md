* The industry had in fact reached the stage of **crisis**.

* lt has been an unfortunate necessity that under section 96 of the Commonwealth Constitution the Commonwealth has entered into the educational field and originally stepped in to deal with the **crisis** at the tertiary level.

* Now at least we have a searing spotlight on the **crisis** between the right and left-wing factions in the Australian Labour Party.

* 1 asked some of these men how they would like it if another government took over and insisted that it had joint control of what went out of that station if a **crisis** arose.

* Credit unions have countless cases on file of people who, through the work of these groups, have graduated from a situation of constant financial **crisis** to one of sound security.

* There is a deepening **crisis** in Commonwealth-State financial relations.

* Or must we, on the other hand, await another national **crisis**, as we did at the outset of World War II, and then employ on road building troops and other key personnel who could well be used actively in various theatres of war?

* De Gaulle and his fellow Common-Marketeers profess sympathy for Australia, New Zealand and Canada in this **crisis**, but that is all.

* Surely even the honorable member for Gippsland, who appears to think that there is no housing **crisis** since he certainly did not deal with it in his speech, will agree that there is no reason to reduce the amount of money made available for housing.

* The **crisis** which faces the Government and the peoples of South Africa today did not have its beginnings yesterday, or last year, or even ten years ago.

* This small, desirable, lucky country, remote geographically from its friends, and sparsely populated, should know that in an hour of **crisis** Australia has a great friend who will come to its aid.

* A real **crisis** developed in industrial relations.

* For example, on the occasion of the Suez **crisis**, did it support the American policy or the more regressive policy of Great Britain?

* I believe that to-day, unfortunately, we have a real **crisis**, which stems from the fact that since the war we have entered on a new phase in the operations of government.

* It also had to contend with another inflationary **crisis** that was the direct product of the Korean war and the doubling of the price of wool, and to undertake the task of maintaining the very large immigration programme of that period.

* If ever a period of **crisis** comes to Australia these men will be playing their part.

* On that point, let it be remembered that the Russian leaders made their public renunciation of war only after they had become fully impressed with the strength and the resolution of the Western nuclear powers at the time of the Cuba **crisis** in October, 1962.

* It is not good enough for interest charges of 26 million to be imposed and for all this money to be diverted into the Consolidated Revenue Fund instead of being used to alleviate the great telephone **crisis** throughout New South Wales.

* There would be no opportunity to re-present the Bill in the remaining few days to ensure that the money is made payable to the schools that need it - namely, those independent schools that have been faced with a **crisis** and that have caused the Minister to act as a catalyst to do something in a moment of dire need when many of them, not all, in some areas were facing a closing down period.

* Why should we ask only volunteers to serve overseas when it is the duty of everybody who is fit to serve if the **crisis**, which we hope will never arise, does arise?

* Now, when a medical **crisis** arises, our elderly people will be able to decide whether to stay in their home, assisted by the Commonwealth or, if they have a housing or financial problem, to go into a home where cheap accommodation is available under this legislation.

* Only a few weeks ago the representatives of building industry employees' unions came to Canberra in the hope of making the Government aware of the **crisis** that has occurred in the building industry because inadequate funds have been made available for housing.

* I think the millers will get over the **crisis**.

* Senator Hannaford  was one of the two members of the Parliament who had, in the past 18 months because of **crisis** of conscience, left the political parties to which they had given a very long and effective period of service.

* The present policy of the fund dates from December, !t9.5:6. lt iis a policy -which followed on the Suez Canal **crisis** of that year.

* Therefore, we have to look at it, not as something novel and new or as something that has burst upon us and caused a **crisis**, but as something which has been continuing in a variety of ways over quite a long period and which has been acknowledged and accepted by governments of various political colours.

* All these organisations and interested people have asked for additional financial assistance for education because of the **crisis** in education in Australia at the levels I have mentioned.

* I call to mind the time immediately after the Suez **crisis** when charter rates were high.

* But what happened when the Cuban **crisis** almost resulted in nuclear warfare?

* As further evidence of sharply reduced returns to egg producers, and of the **crisis** in the industry, I have a Victorian Department of Agriculture report, which honorable members may peruse if they wish, which is literally hot from the press.

* The Minister himself may well have attempted to find an alternative to military service, but the failure of his Cabinet colleagues and others to find some satisfactory alternative to military service in this context shows that they lack the common sense and morality which is necessary to deal with a democratic community at a time of such **crisis**.

* We do not want a situation to develop in which housing construction increases to such an extent that a **crisis** develops for the industry in future, and in which immediate scarcities are created together with rising costs.

* Tunku Abdul Rahman made this clear in connexion with the Laos **crisis** in April, 1961, when he confirmed that he had been approached about the movement of troops if war broke out over Laos.

* For instance, at the time of the Suez **crisis**, the United Kingdom had to draw very heavily on the International Monetary Fund.

* This seems to mean, as I will indicate in a few minutes, that the aircraft industry in the most advanced countries had reached a point of **crisis** in 1958-59. and that the transfer to the turbo-jet, which meant re-equipping, changed the rate of development in the industry as a whole.

* Are we to rely upon some obscure African nation to send us forces in a **crisis**, knowing that the whole weight of Russian might will be thrown suddenly into the conflict, and knowing that Russia wants world domination and that communism cannot live in a free world?

* Our history shows that the people turn to the Australian Labour Party in time of **crisis**.

* The " Australian " reported on Saturday, 13th August, under the heading " Hospitals Face Financial Crisis " that doctors are working a 90 hour week.

* He refused to give me any indication, in answer to my question, as to when he will put before the House some proposal to deal with this very crucial **crisis** in the motor car industry.

* The fact is that the measures which have been announced by the Government since the election, and which were anathema to it during the campaign, have been borrowed largely from the Australian Labour Party, but the attitude of the Government and the the attitude of the Australian Labour Party to the economic **crisis** which confronts Australia are completely opposite.

* Has not the air been filled and made hideous with banal cries on television that the nation turns to the Labour Party in times of **crisis**, that the Labour Party established the Royal Australian 
Despite these very real objections there would be available to any government in time of **crisis** a means of controlling these overseas interests, at least as far as their Australian operations are concerned.

* Whenever an educational **crisis** develops now in a field which the Prime Minister accepts, a committee of outside experts is set up.

* I believe that there is a **crisis** at hand - not at the military level, but at the political level.

* When Labour was in office in a most tricky period of our foreign exchange **crisis** during the war and shortly afterwards, it always permitted the remittance of profits and dividends, with only une small and rather curious exception.

* If the Prime Minister thinks that the two jobs can be combined, he has no understanding whatsoever of the extent of the **crisis** in education in Australia or the magnitude of the task to be done by his own or by a subsequent administration.

* At the time of the Suez **crisis**, however, rioting squads damaged the statuary to such an extent that it was decided to have what remained removed to Australia.

* This would be the kind of adversary and opposition with which the Government could not cope, and just as it has thrown in the towel in the face of adversity in times of international **crisis** - in times when disaster has faced this country in the past - so would it go to water if 34- Communists arrived here as part of the 1 24 members of this Parliament.

* Let me take a summary look at the housing **crisis** that is in evidence around the countryside.

* The Minister for Social Services  (Mr. Roberton)  and other Ministers, including the Prime Minister, can attempt to alibi themselves, but the fact is that this matter has been regarded in this country as creating a **crisis** only of recent times, in fact only since the occasion of  Mr. Sandys's  visit to Australia to put the British Government's point of view.

* But the only reference that I have heard made to the Berlin **crisis** recently by an honorable member opposite was made by the member for East Sydney  (Mr. Ward)  and I do not think that it was in good taste.

* There is no particular **crisis** which warranted the immediate implementation in intrastate transport of the Convention International Civil Aviation decided on at the Chicago conference.

* These are the people who earlier created an education **crisis** and who are now passing into the work force, who are marrying and rearing families.

* This is particularly so in relation to transport, because unless we can produce the equipment required for our own railways we shall find that in a time of national **crisis**, when we cannot get the equipment overseas, we shall have to train men to repair and reequip our railway systems.

* That will leave a great Australian who has emerged, again in a time of **crisis**, to lead and carry on the good work begun by Chifley, which was so sadly interrupted by the tragic election of the hopelessly inefficient and incapable present Prime Minister in 1949.

* The "Australian Financial Review " has run a series of articles on the **crisis** in the defence industries.

* Performances in the recent devaluation **crisis** indicate a sophistication and skill that was not surpassed throughout the financial world.

* The Government has never been primarily concerned to end the education **crisis** - everyone knows there is a shortage of teachers, a shortage of schools, inadequate tuition and so on - or to relieve the burden of ill health, and this hits most the people who can bear it least, or to provide better housing for the poorer people or to raise pensions systematically.

* At the time of the **crisis** in Goulburn when the Catholic schools were closed because they felt not able to carry on in the face of certain State decisions, a quite different situation developed.

* My mind goes back to the debate which took place in this chamber just prior to the last general election when the honorable member for Yarra  (Dr. J. F. Cairns)  predicted that there would be a fall - a very heavy fall as he saw it - in our overseas reserves and that this would lead, in turn, to a credit squeeze programme and that the Government was going to a general election because of the decline in reserves which would produce for it an economic **crisis**.

* Whenever the Australian Labor Party puts up proposals to finance social welfare, increase the pensions, make a better health service or remove the education **crisis** - things that affect every section of the Australian community, city and country alike - the Liberal-Country Party leaders raise the same old chorus: 'Where is the money coming from?'

* It was a time of great national **crisis**.

* Three months later he suddenly discovered that Australia had reached a **crisis**, with over-full employment, galloping inflation and inability to meet our overseas commitments.

* Current events give no indication of any **crisis**, but determination to maintain the par value of sterling is manifest everywhere.

* The Commission has been able to put on special ships when we have needed them in a **crisis**.

* Of course not, because this Government can only bother itself to give enough attention to the urgent problems of expanding our economic structure when a **crisis** exists.

* In raising this matter, honorable members opposite have laid much emphasis on the claim that there is a **crisis** in the educational situation in the Australian community today.

* It will not have been lost on honorable gentlemen that at a very early stage in the Cuba **crisis** the great United States of America, despite the size of its forces, started to withdraw men from the work force almost immediately and bring them into the services.

* I think, however, that it is significant also, as honorable members will see from the report, that at the moment when the situation reached its **crisis** in the General Council, there was a realisation by all delegates that the future of the Association was of even greater importance than the issues arising from the situation in Southern Rhodesia.

* I wish to deal specifically tonight with the sugar industry because I think it is fair to say that the present **crisis** in the sugar industry is the worst that has been experienced for many a year.

* As the honorable member well knows, rationing was imposed to assist the United Kingdom at a time of great financial **crisis** and, after the war had ended, to maintain its financial resources.

* Where he felt that Britain was in error he said so, as at the time of the Suez **crisis**.

* So we have the sorry spectacle of the Opposition trying to sabotage our defence efforts, but when a **crisis** arises they scream because we do not have the facilities for training all of our 20 year olds and must select by the fairest means at our disposal only a proportion of them.

* On a national basis, in peace-time it is necessary to have the strong textile industry which was built up under the Scullin Labour Government; but, in war-time - if such a **crisis** should ever arise - if the textile industry is weak we will have a weak defence effort and we will not be able to produce supplies for our forces.

* reaching **crisis** proportions in some of our cities.

* How many times have I heard in this House - and I have not been here for 2 years yet - the ridicule of honourable members opposite of the Labor Party's proposal to have an urgent and comprehensive survey of the calamitous **crisis** in education in Australia?

* His  firm but restrained handling of the Cuban **crisis** in 1962, his clear but calm attitude towards the Berlin problem and his vigorous warnings of the futility of nuclear war all raised the hopes of mankind for a better, saner world.

* This is a time of great ethical **crisis** for many 20-year-olds.

* In 1957 the Prime Minister said that there was no housing **crisis**.

* For instance, at the moment there is an acute **crisis** in education throughout Australia.

* When the history of this **crisis** is written I believe that people will respect the efforts of the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Primary Industry.

* It is very good and very convenient to live close to one's place of work, but if applicants may be selective to that extent one cannot say that there is a severe housing **crisis**.

* No sensible person would suggest that the independent school system is going to collapse overnight but it has been facing a **crisis** and as the private schools are forced to close a classroom here and a classroom there and reject more and more pupils, these pupils are being forced, in increasing numbers, to attend the already overcrowded and inadequate state schools, and this has aggravated considerably the problems of the state schools.

* These two great matters, superficially so different in origin and superficially irrelevant to a federal budget, have one great thing in common: They both reflect the failure of the national government, this Government, to involve itself in the problem of the cities and to accept that these problems are at the base of the **crisis** in CommonwealthState relations.

* Anyone who knows the condition of development of Australia - basic development, regional development, northern development; anyone who knows the condition of education - the **crisis** that exists in our schools system; anyone who knows the inadequacies of research and technical development; anyone who knows the inability of industry to overcome the problems of relatively rapid automation as they exist in Australia today, cannot be complacent about the situation.

* The **crisis** in this section of our export industry is due to the fact that as no decision has yet been made by the Commonwealth Government's devaluation committee this section of the industry cannot forward sell its products because of doubts about compensation payments due to it following the devaluation of sterling.

* If we are in this period of **crisis** that all responsible people seem to think we are in, what person in Australia today would say that we should apply the brakes to our development, to our population and to our security?

* Not so long ago, during the Suez **crisis**, we were considerably worried as to whether Australia would continue to have an availability of crude oil which is so necessary for our industries.

* I ask the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry whether he is aware of a claim by New Zealand Treasury officials that New Zealand's wool **crisis** and balance of payments problem have been caused by a massive wool buyers' speculation against the New Zealand Wool Commission, a claim supported by the general manager of the New Zealand Co-operative Wool Marketing Association.

* In the light of the admission by the Treasurer in a television interview during the week-end that the Commonwealth Parliament lacks the legislative powers, which are available to other national parliaments, to take more orthodox economic measures to deal with the credit and investment **crisis** now facing Australia, and in view of the current disagreement between the Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament on a money bill, of which the Government is no doubt fully aware, will the right honorable gentleman give the people an opportunity to implement the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Committee set up by this Parliament some four and a half years ago to investigate problems such as the economic ones now confronting us; and, if he intends to do so, will he arrange for the necessary referendum to be held as soon as is constitutionally possible next year?

* Neither I nor other Opposition members have any quarrel with control by the growers, especially democratic control, for it is well that the producers, except in times of national **crisis**, direct the affairs of their own industry.

* When this particular industry was knocked this symbol of prosperity was knocked, and this produced1 the **crisis** of confidence that the Government spoke of so much in a recent debate in this Parliament.

* I refer to a question I addressed to the Minister on 4th April of last year and to statements made by the Minister over a period to the effect that the United Nations organization faces an uncertain future if member nations, in particular the Soviet Union and its allies, still refuse to pay their duly assessed contributions while some other countries, including Australia, are making additional contributions to the United Nations to help resolve its financial **crisis** and to enable the organization to continue its peace-keeping operations.

* I had the pleasure of visiting Cuba last year, a week before the Cuban **crisis** came to a head.

* A. Calwell, defined the Labour Party's attitude to the West New Guinea **crisis**.

* It evades its duty to overcome the housing **crisis** which is a blot on the Government.

* This has given the nation enormous reserves of strength which can be drawn on in lean years or in times of defence **crisis**.

* There is a **crisis** in the affairs of the Tariff Board, if not in manufacturing industry in Australia - and  I  emphasise the words 'if nol in manufacturing industry in Australia'.

* Next I shall deal with those measures which the Government has outlined to deal with the immediate **crisis** of inflation.

* America did not support our Prime Minister's attitude in the United Nations on the Suez **crisis**.

* In view of the grave uncertainty amongst apple and pear growers and their leaders over falling overseas returns and the substantial increase in freight rates to apply next season, with the grave effect this will have on the economics of this delicately balanced industry now facing its greatest **crisis** for many years, will the Prime Minister have an investigation made by the Department of Trade and Industry or the Department of Primary Industry into the situation to determine in what way the Commonwealth Government may be able to assist financially in saving the industry from at least partial collapse?

* What can we think of a country that for more than 60 years has had a constitution that does not confer on the Parliament the power to control costs and wages in times of **crisis**?

* The industry is now caught in this startling cost rise, and many dairy farmers wish they had voted for the referendum in 1948 instead of against it, as they were asked to do by  Sir Arthur  Fadden, who was leader of the Australian Country Party, and the Prime Minister  (Mr. 
fails to attack the **crisis** in education in Australia in the areas of greatest need; 
The Opposition tries, in a whole variety of fields and in various debates, to suggest that we do not meet the challenge of the increasing demands on education.

* the Opposition alleges a failure to attack the **crisis** in education, but I would like to point out what has been achieved in recent times while this Government has been in office, not necessarily directly through its own intervention in education but because of the funds that it has made available to the States to enable them to tackle many of their own problems.

* In view of the **crisis** facing Australian wheat growers through failure of the Government to complete a wheat agreement guaranteeing a minimum price for this year's wheat crop, what action does the Government now propose to take to prevent the bottom falling out of the wheat market?

* Has the Treasurer seen a publication recently issued by the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, directing attention to the steady increase in local government rates and the financial **crisis** which has beset local government authorities?

* It is therefore, my earnest hope that the states in question will in good lime be persuaded by the weight of world opinion to discharge their arrears, and thereby relieve the organization both of the financial **crisis** which they themselves have largely created and of the difficult decisions which will otherwise have to be taken in their regard.

* This year, a **crisis** was thrown up to our universities.

* We have frequently reached the situation in respect of international tensions and conflicts in which we have found ourselves at the end limited only to defence policy, when in fact we could do very little by the use of defence weapons, and when in fact we had ignored for months and years the questions of foreign policy which finally led to the situation of **crisis**.

* We have a position of **crisis** to-day in the Caribbean, which we are endeavouring to solve in terms of defence policy.

* In a time of **crisis** our dependence on overseas shipping interests could leave us isolated and at a standstill.

* The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other Opposition speakers said repeatedly that amendments of the Crimes Act were not necessary at the time of the Suez Canal incident and at other times of **crisis**, and they asked: Why are these amendments necessary now?

* What is really involved in this bill is not a general borrowing programme or a perambulation through the economy, but the ability to borrow for short terms during a **crisis** in our balance of payments situation.

* These are the two main issues - ability to obtain accommodation in the event of a balance of payments **crisis**, and the maintenance of our representation.

* If we did have a balance of payments **crisis**, the fact that we could, at a pinch, to tide us over a short-term difficulty, borrow up to nearly 200,000,000 is a very great safeguard for future employment and for the stability of the Australian economy.

* If the capital inflow were cut off to-morrow for any reason, we would immediately face a tremendous employment **crisis** and economic dislocation which, if we had no source upon which to draw, would be very serious.

* It is to be hoped that the Government will take whatever measures are available to it to increase the understanding of the operations of these institutions, because it is hardly credible that a forward step such as is contemplated in this legislation, giving us the power to borrow on a short-term basis in a time of international **crisis**, should be opposed by the Opposition, if in fact the issues are widely understood.

* But to oppose a measure which would give us the capacity to raise money quickly in conditions of international **crisis** would seem almost madness.

* It is difficult to understand why the Opposition should oppose this measure, when a previous Labour government found similar powers extremely useful in times of **crisis**.

* Whatever view one may take of that kind of exercise, what this measure does is to provide Australia with a means of raising more ready cash in times of **crisis**.

* The first part commences " it fails to recognise "; the second part, " it makes inadequate adjustments "; the third part, " it fails to recognise the serious **crisis** "; the fourth part, " it does not acknowledge the lack of confidence "; the fifth part, " it does not recognise the need of further basic development "; and the sixth part, " it docs nothing to relieve our dependence ".

* That anomaly becomes clear in any period of emergency in Australia, such as at the time of the Suez **crisis**, when the Prime Minister becomes primarily responsible for all external affairs matters.

* But of course, when the **crisis** arose elections were at hand, and we find the Australian Government making a big demonstration, looking for local publicity.

* Is he aware  that  Mr. Askin,  Leader of the Liberal Party in the New South Wales Parliament, recently contended that a conference should be called between Federal, State and local government representatives for the purpose of considering the financial **crisis** prevailing in respect of Australia's local government instrumentalities?

* Every time a gas bill comes in, it is a **crisis** in the house.

* Every time an electricity bill has to be paid, it is a **crisis** in the house.

* When rates have to be met, it is a **crisis** in the house.

* However, we in Australia are living at a time of **crisis**.

* Dealing with defence, I was disappointed yesterday to hear the Minister for the Interior  (Mr. Freeth)  endeavour to justify the Governments' action in placing orders overseas for new aircraft and naval vessels without paying any regard to the fact that if our own Australian factories and shipyards received some of those orders the experience gained in fulfilling them would be invaluable in time of **crisis**.

* It would be well if we had some authoritative body, experienced in the higher branches of engineering, to examine the various Australian industries to learn to what extent they would be able to undertake the responsibility of producing our essential needs in time of **crisis**.

* The Parliament now has a chance to express an Australian point of view by adopting the resolution which has been submitted by the Opposition on this South African **crisis**.

* Sales tax was levied originally on motor cars and other items as a war-time and a depression measure, in a time of great **crisis**.

* Nonetheless, the honorable gentleman will be glad to know that the **crisis** period - if I may use that expression - has passed and that most of the Tasmanian crop has now been shipped.

* There will be another **crisis** in the dairying industry.

* Further, can the Treasurer advise to what extent he will be made aware of the deliberations which will emanate from the meeting of the finance ministers of the Group of Ten who are meeting in Bonn today to discuss the currency **crisis**?

* I mention that because if there is a **crisis** in education in Australia I can better understand it whenI think of the honourable member as a school teacher.

* I do not think anybody will deny that in this particular **crisis** the people who are heavily encumbered will not be able to get from the trading banks the facilities they need.

* In every time of **crisis** - in World War I. and World War II.

* The report that was recently submitted to Parliament appeared on the surface to be helpful, but in the light of the suddenly altered circumstances, due in no small measure to the lifting of import restrictions, a **crisis** developed in the industry with the most alarming rapidity.

* From the beginning of the Sino-Indian **crisis** Pakistan showed a conspicuous lack of sympathy for India.

* It evades its duty to end the housing **crisis** to which the honorable member for Mitchell referred.

* If a situation is left until it becomes a **crisis**, it is not always possible to get the best solution.

* He began his speech by saying that I had said that the United States of America could not claim to have been attacked in the present **crisis**.

* To argue, as honorable members opposite have done, that there is a **crisis** in education and that the States are helpless because the Commonwealth Government is not providing enough money, is to base the argument on something which is not true.

* It is useless to talk about iron and steel mills, chemical and fertiliser industries, aluminium smelters or large scale processing works unless the power **crisis** is solved.

* As Australia's reserve of overseas funds has  risen  to more than 80O million, compared wilh 300 million in the **crisis** caused by over-importing three years ago,  I  wonder why the Government should want to borrow at all at this particular stage.

* We recall that when the Government of the United Kingdom, our mother country, was in political controversy over the Suez **crisis** the United States told her that she could not depend on the United States to support her should the war escalate.

* In this hour of **crisis** when, after ten years our prices are 100 per cent.

* In periods of industrial or economic **crisis** the mask is dropped, their fangs are bared and repression and coercion become the order of the day.

* The rule of law, the right to a democratic trial, and the onus of proof incumbent on the prosecutor, are claimed for themselves and their associates, but are denied to the working man at the first signs of a **crisis**.

* Hence, the economy drifted to a **crisis** point in November, 1 960, when drastic controls were forced on the Government.

* I ask the Minister for External Affairs: Is it a fact that a financial **crisis** threatens to engulf the United Nations Organization because the Soviet bloc and some other countries refuse to meet their obligations?

* I support the Prime Minister, and I am proud to be an Australian standing squarely behind his actions in this **crisis**.

* The honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  referred to the Suez **crisis**.

* This is not a **crisis** of confidence in the Government.

* His  failures with Nasser over the Suez Canal **crisis** in 1956, at the General Assembly of the United Nations and in connexion with the Summit Conference in 1960, and now at the Conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in 1961 are milestones on his road to failure!

* I remind the honorable gentleman that the action of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee was taken at a time when the citrus growers were already facing a serious financial **crisis**.

* The honorable member for Lawson said that if members of the Opposition had been on this committee two years ago they would not, and could not possibly, have made the serious mistakes that they made then in their references to Indonesia and in the policy that they adopted in the Indonesian **crisis** at that time.

* But behind all this is the fact that unless we develop selfreliance in our scientific, technical and intellectual resources and our application of them we will, in the moment of **crisis**, be sold down the river.

* I think everybody received a copy of the noble document entitled 'The People's Rights Denied' which contains a background to the **crisis** between the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council and the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Nixon).

* Am I to understand that at the time of the Korean **crisis** we should have insisted that we have an effective voice tn the affairs of the people of South Korea, and that we should have insisted on bringing into existence a clear and definite treaty arrangement before involving Australian forces?

* The Labour Party has ignored entirely the southward march of communism and I regret that some honorable members opposite have appeared, as in the case of the Cuba **crisis**, which was debated in this House recently, in the role of apologists for aggressive communism.

* This is not a **crisis**.

* As a result, we allow ourselves to drift into a **crisis** and then attempt to deal with the situation piecemeal.

* All 1 ask is that we realize and face the facts, not just drift into a **crisis** and then do the wrong thing, lt is vitally necessary in the world of to-day to have a definite policy, not just to drift along, hoping for the best.

* This must be the guiding force in the future because the industry today is facing a serious **crisis**.

* .- The debate this afternoon is on a simple question - whether members of this House and, of course, the community outside, consider there is any urgency about education and whether or not there is anything that could be described as a **crisis** in education in Australia.

* The Minister for Social Services  (Mr. Sinclair),  from whom we would expect some sympathy on this subject, began by saying: " It appears to the Opposition that there is some **crisis** in education ".

* Not only does it appear to the Opposition, but it appears to Ministers in State Parliaments, even Liberal Party Ministers, that there is a **crisis** in education.

* The Liberal members of the State Parliaments have made out a strong case on the urgency, but the Government's representative, the Minister responsible for education, has replied that there is no such thing as a **crisis**.

* In answer to these claims the Minister for Health - the spokesman for the Government - speaks of the Opposition as " squeaking away " about an education **crisis**.

* It may be that it will be proved in the future that the Australian development capacity to increase the defence effort can be brought in a moment of **crisis** to assist these people.

* In view of the submissions on education made on behalf of all Premiers at the last Premiers' Conference, and in view of the nation-wide petition presented to the Parliament at the end of the last sessional period, I ask the Prime Minister to say what action the Commonwealth Government is taking to meet this widespread request for a specific emergency grant to deal with the **crisis** in primary, secondary and technical education and teacher training.

* But if they read, as I believe they do, and if they are as observant as they obviously should be, then they must understand that a great number of people receiving social service payments are facing a **crisis**.

* Has the right honorable gentleman's attention been directed to the disastrous cyclone damage in Carnarvon, Western Australia, and is the Commonwealth Government taking any steps to assist the citizens of Carnarvon in this **crisis**?

* Let me go on to the next point - that the maintenance of adequate conventional forces may help us to grapple our allies to us in any future **crisis**.

* After all, both General Motors-Holden's and the Ford company in their very bitter fight for the largest share of the car market in Australia were very large contributors to the **crisis** with which this Government was called upon to deal.

* There is a **crisis**!

* I do not know whether it is myself- 
The **crisis** in education at all levels is an integral part of the whole **crisis** in CommonwealthState relations.

* Equally one would have thought that the Australian Country Party would be demanding early and full debates on the **crisis** in our great primary industries.. One would not expect the Liberals to urge these matters - this sectional Party now holds only nine seats outside the State capitals.

* I received word from him over the table a couple of hours ago, or perhaps one and three-quarter hours ago, that he proposed to suspend Grievance Day to-morrow and to resume the debate on the Cuban **crisis**.

* In the last few days, we have heard some rumblings that Cabinet is to meet - one and a half months after the **crisis** was identified and declared by the Minister.

* I refer to the **crisis** again facing our fellow Commonwealth country, India.

* Have we any determination whatever to reverse the flow of ideas and reverse initiatives in Asia instead of waiting for Communism to take the initiative - to create a **crisis** - and then try to contain it?

* These moves, of course, do not mean that the basic issues that lay behind the financial **crisis** have in any way been solved.

* I assure honorable members on the Government side that if we were faced with a **crisis** in industry and the Government was able to go to the workers with clean hands it would get, for the sake of the industry's welfare, a measure of co-operation that perhaps it did not expect.

* I do not wish to quote in detail what he said but the headline above a report of his speech stated: " Crisis Ahead in Shipping ".

* In view of the increasing deficit of food production per head of population in the world and the current annual expenditure of some 70,000 times as much on military budgets as on population **crisis** control, will he consider Australian initiative in setting up an international population control project based on humane, rational and voluntary educational, medical and economic measures.

* I have no need to remind honorable members of the Berlin blockade and, more recently, of the Cuban **crisis**.

* When I first came into this House and heard that a matter of urgency was to be discussed I would think: What **crisis** has hit the nation and what case is going to be put before the Parliament by the Opposition.

* It is about time that the Government started to plan in order to meet this great **crisis** in the coal industry.

* How, I ask, do you deal with any emerging international **crisis** now?

* This is a **crisis** which has developed because of circumstances beyond the control of the people who export their fruit each year to European and other countries.

* Members of the Opposition have referred to what they term " the Suez **crisis** ", in which the Prime Minister was supposed to have lost us friends because of his actions.

* In the **crisis** of wartime, man-power controls were accepted, but in times of peace it takes a Liberal-Country Party Government to destroy so-called uneconomic or, at the other extreme, flourishishing industries in order to conscript labour to other fields of employment.

* They would' have been ideal components of United Nations forces after the **crisis** over the Suez Canal, the Lebanon and the Congo.

* nucleus is allowed to die out, no amount of money or the volunteering of hundreds of thousands of gallant untrained individuals will enable an effective citizen army to be suddenly recreated in a **crisis**, with the cohesion, confidence and efficiency of past fighters for Australia's freedom.

* Will the Commonwealth Government give sympathetic consideration to the request, which I understand will soon come from the Premier of Victoria, to assist Victoria with a loan of $40m, to be spread over 5 years, to meet half the cost of the construction of an urgently needed underground railway for Melbourne whose 2 million people constitute one-sixth of Australia's total population and which is approaching a public transport **crisis**' of major proportions?

* In the present **crisis** concerning sterling, is one of the conditions of the International Monetary Fund extending another $ 1,000m standby loan to Britain the Fund's demand that the United Kingdom should re-examine its policy of allowing the outflow of portfolio investment from the United Kingdom to Australia and South Africa?

* So the attempts the Government makes in these circumstances to solve its education **crisis** or to improve the housing of the poor people or to build roads or to achieve decentralisation - all the things that need development in the public sector and are covered by public policy - are set back by the very procedures that the Government follows.

* - To show that this view is held by quite a number of people, let me quote, first, the American economist John P. Lewis, who said - 
If there is one section of the Australian community that has never been found wanting in any **crisis** that this country has faced throughout its history, that section is the trade union movement.

* At this time, when the Labour Party in the Commonwealth Parliament is telling us that there is a financial **crisis** in the country, and that people are unemployed and on the breadline, the workers in Queensland are going to lose 300,000 as a result of an irresponsible strike called on by the Trades and Labour Council, a Communist organization.

* That would have been the position if we had allowed a condition of bust to emerge from the boom **crisis** which was developing around us.

* When everything else had gone, including almost an army overnight, it was the leader who said, "We will never surrender ", and who carried Great Britain through that **crisis**.

* Australia has participated in several ways in attempts to assist in meeting this **crisis**.

* Then, in response to a particular Indian request a little time ago, we made a direct gift of 150,000 tons of Australian wheat in order to meet a particular **crisis** that had arisen.

* There is a **crisis** in Australian education I warn our people that the **crisis** is qualitative as well as quantitative.

* But if all these material needs - what one may call the externa of education - were met, there would still be a **crisis** in Australian education.

* On 27th July - long before the **crisis** in the Gulf of Tonkin - " Newsweek " pointed out that there are huge masses of Chinese forces in the provinces of Kwangsi and Yunnan.

* The most hopeful development in post-war history has been the detente between Russia and the United States since the Cuban **crisis** of 1962.

* Did that deputation submit facts to show that a serious **crisis** had developed in the Australian textile industry and that urgent government assistance was necessary if a serious industry collapse was to be avoided?

* In fact, had it not been for the addition to the work force made by women we could easily have found - I use this term advisedly - a **crisis** in the employment of labour in Australia.

* I intend to deal with this matter at a later stage, but this morning I wish to devote my 10 minutes to the current wheat **crisis**.

* For the past 12 months it has been obvious that a wheat **crisis** was imminent.

* The Government's approach to this explosive **crisis** is one of apathy and passing the buck.

* It is about time this Government woke up to this **crisis**.

* The storages are not there- 
As a result of all these factors, the meat export **crisis** that some people feared throughout the course of the last year has receded for the present very much into the background.

* he criticised Great Britain and Australia for giving wholehearted support to Malaysia in the present **crisis** and he criticised the nation- 
This well prepared document "Some Notes on Drought in Australia " which was compiled by officers of the Bureau of Meteorology contains a section headed "What is Drought?".

* There is at present a **crisis** caused by drought and we all know it.

* So be says that in his belief this country should not take the attitude that in the present **crisis** Malaysia has right on its side.

* If ever there was a Treasurer who should wish that he had additional powers at this time to deal with Australia's economic **crisis**, it is the present Treasurer.

* The Minister for National Development argues that there has been no **crisis** in the coal mining industry, but I remind him that in the coal-mining area of Lithgow the population dropped from 15,128 to 14,222, and that in the Cessnock area it declined by approximately 4,000.

* I ask the Minister for External Affairs: Does his Government feel any concern or disquiet at all over the escalation of the war in Vietnam towards world war in a situation which is thought by some world leaders to have reached a very serious **crisis**?

* Will you please excuse me for writing to you on what may seem to you a trivial matter but to myself and family it is a **crisis**.

* The serious aspect of the situation is that in a dire international **crisis** these transportation arrangements could be brought to a standstill.

* It is doing this in the middle of an economic **crisis**.

* This shows that the Government, no matter what its intentions, might be subconsciously influencing the judges on the various tribunals which will be called upon to adjudicate on wage applications and other things at a time of economic **crisis**.

* In view of the widespread reports of very great hunger, distress and suffering in our Commonwealth country, India, will the Minister make an approach to the office of the Indian High Commission with a view to ascertaining the extent to which Australia could assist India with food during the present **crisis** period?

* He refers in his amendment, which I shall not read out in full, to the inadequate adjustments to social service payments, the Government's failure to recognise the serious **crisis** in education and to acknowledge the lack of confidence on the part of the business community.

* Under the heading " Election year - but no incentive " the newspaper's leader writer states - 
There is no solution to the present staffing **crisis** outside the framework of a 5-day working week.

* In my opinion this is a major **crisis** on the waterways of the world.

* The Minister must surely be aware that the backlog of postal traffic, particularly in Sydney, has reached the proportions of a serious **crisis**.

* With the exception of the amount provided for the Mount Isa railway and the amount of 1.6 million for the development of Weipa, which was the amount provided for northern development in the last Budget, every other project in northern Australia has been associated with some electoral reverse or some **crisis** in an electorate.

* That is another country that has had to plan -  a planning board - called, however, not the " planning " but the " programming bureau "-had been set up in response to the difficulties of the Belgium economy during recent years, now aggravated by the Congo **crisis**.

* This inane support of demands for shorter working hours in this time of **crisis** in our economic system is completely beyond my comprehension and, I think, the comprehension of practically all the people of Australia.

* My question to the Minister for External Affairs refers to a recent announcement that Australia is making an additional contribution to the United Nations to help resolve its financial **crisis** resulting from the unwillingness of some members - particularly Communist countries - to pay their assessed contributions.

* His  greatest faux pas in the years during which he was Minister for the Army was when he said at the time of the Suez **crisis** that he had 20,000 Australian troops ready and waiting to go into battle.

* The Prime Minister alone is responsible for this decision appearing to have been made with a sense of great urgency in an atmosphere of **crisis**.

* Britain is going through an economic **crisis**.

* This recession might even be accompanied by something of a liquidity **crisis** because of the unco-ordinated manner in which new types of financial activity have been allowed to develop.

* That the present financial **crisis** in the sugar industry is due entirely to a combination of two things, the expansion of the industry and the low price of sugar on (he world market, cannot be emphasised enough.

* Thirdly, honorable members should consider the great **crisis** that we face in education.

* Fourthly, we have **crisis** with social services.

* It is all very well for honorable members opposite to rise in their places from time to time during a **crisis** or semicrisis or at some other time when they think there is a grievance upon which they can capitalize and go to town on it, saying what wonderful things they could do for the country if only they were on the Treasury bench.

* Yet he had the colossal nerve to try to fix the Suez **crisis**.

* The Government has abandoned the referendum, to my mind, because of the economic **crisis** into which this country is being led by this Government.

* If this is so, it is the first break through in the 41 weeks old fruit **crisis**.

* The Launceston "Examiner" of 22nd July last year published an article headed " World's Driest Continent: Water Crisis in Australia " and written by Frank Mangan.

* I also ask him to closely and urgently examine the entire range of other factors currently providing such a problem and producing throughout Australia almost a situation of **crisis** in primary industry.

* I am not suggesting that it is a formed reserve but it is easier in an emergency or **crisis** to bring 'back a soldier who has had training than it is, as was done in the last war, to pull men out of the streets, give them rifles and uniforms and send them into war without any training.

* The Opposition fully supports the principle of providing financial assistance for the Australian sugar industry in its hours of financial and economic **crisis**, but we do not support the pinchpenny financing methods of this Government which are so freely enunciated in this measure.

* There would be a diplomatic **crisis** every day as there was between India and South Africa when there was an Indian representative in the latter country.

* The honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr." Clyde Cameron) is reminding me that Lord Denning was called upon at the time of Great Britain's hour of trial in the Profumo' **crisis**.

* The McCarrey Committee was established to report on land costs and the housing **crisis**.

* Also, will he give an assurance that while the present **crisis** in the international sphere continues Parliament will be called together whenever necessary during the forthcoming winter recess in order that it may be kept informed of the course of events and Australia's position in regard thereto?

* We have only to cast our thoughts back to the time of the Hungarian **crisis** to realize what scant respect Russia was prepared to give to the United Nations.

* Will he keep the House advised from time to time of developments in diplomatic circles and in naval and air force fields in the present **crisis** in United States and Soviet relations over charges concerning the building of missile bases and  jetports  in Cuba, about which the world learnt from an authoritative source for the first time when President Kennedy delivered his broadcast to the American people a few hours ago?

* The **crisis** is not on us now.

* We all know that there is a **crisis**- in local government through lack of finance.

* The records of this country show that although freedom, loyalty, trust and unity are inherent in the Australian character, even here in the recent past, people have suffered because of executive and similar acts against them in times of emotional **crisis**.

* At page 19 of his report,  Mr. Justice  Clyne, who had been appointed a commissioner, stated - 
fails to attack the **crisis** in education in Australia in the areas of greatest need; 
If this matter is so close to the Opposition's heart that it feels that this legislation falls short of what is required, what was wrong with putting forward this amendment when the States Grants (Pre-school Teachers Colleges) Bill was before the House earlier this afternoon?

* No suggestion was then made that the legislation either did not measure up to, or had failed to attack, the **crisis** in education in this country.

* That conference agreed unanimously that there was a state of **crisis** in the Australian education system.

* In the second instance, last year, over a quarter of a million people saw fit to sign a petition begging this Parliament to recognize the state of **crisis** in education in Australia.

* This time, the Prime Minister said simply, " I do not believe there is a **crisis** ".

* Like the petitioners, like the conference at Leichhardt and like the six Australian Premiers, the delegates to this Conference agreed unanimously that any dramatic assistance and relief in the urgent **crisis** afflicting Australian education must come from this Commonwealth Parliament.

* It directed attention to the state of **crisis** in science education.

* As Australian tourists 'travelling abroad reduce our overseas balance, will the Acting Prime Minister undertake also, as part of the Government's plan, substantially to reduce or to eliminate ministerial tourism during the present financial **crisis**?

* That is another reason for this Berlin **crisis**.

* In dealing with the short term aspect of the **crisis** the Government has always turned to a reduction in domestic expenditure.

* Nothing that puts pressure on  Mr. Wilson  to use force or that seeks to produce a **crisis** in Rhodesia is of any real ultimate value.

* One of the occasions on which members of the Opposition have said the Prime Minister failed was that occasion of the Suez **crisis**.

* If necessary it should become a constructing authority, or at least it should work in coordination with the States to use the money for defence roads, so that in time of **crisis** the Australian defence machine will be mobile and will not become bogged down through inadequate transport facilities.

* The statement by the present Minister shows that the Government has by devious means changed its policy on West New Guinea; changed it dramatically, intentionally and, I would say, unscrupulously in order to keep in line with certain new trends of thought which have arisen since the **crisis** of New Guinea has assumed such importance in the eyes of the world.

* There must be an end to this policy of drifting from **crisis** to **crisis** and dealing with each one hour by hour, as it arises.

* For the whole period during which the present **crisis** was in gestation, Australia did not even have a fulltime Minister for External Affairs.

* But even though the West New Guinea dispute had developed into an urgent **crisis**, he still did not think it necessary to appoint a full-time Minister.

* I have said we are not interested in preserving this last remnant of Dutch imperialism in this part of the world but, having said that, justice demands that I also say that the Netherlands' approach to this **crisis** gives little ground for criticism.

* The Minister tells us there is no **crisis**.

* I say there is a **crisis** which demands leadership and strength of purpose which this Government has shown itself incapable of providing.

* This dispute has been allowed by this Government to drift to the point of **crisis**; and now it denies there is a **crisis**.

* Indeed, he and several others have sought to create an impression that we are in a critical condition, that the whole State educational structure is in effect in a state of **crisis**.

* These figures do not demonstrate a **crisis**.

* The honorable member, who has constantly interested himself on behalf of the industry, will remember that nine or ten years ago there was a **crisis** in the industry and that this Government, with which he was at that time associated as a parliamentary secretary, did much to re-establish a basis of stability for the industry.

* The right honourable gentleman will remember that yesterday I asked him whether representations had been made to the Australian High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur by Tun Abdul Razak for special aid to handle the **crisis** in western Malaysia.

* The right honorable gentleman does not want a debate on the Cuban **crisis** because, if there is a proper debate on this, his proposed time-table which aims at a rising at the end of next week cannot be fulfilled.

* All along he has not intended to have a debate on the Cuban **crisis** in this place at all, and none of us would have been able to speak on this matter if it had not been for my initiative last night.

* That was the answer given by a responsible Minister at a time of **crisis** that could have embroiled the world in war.

* The Federal Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes the intervention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, in the Cuban **crisis** so momentous for humanity.

* I have indicated the great **crisis** which developed because of this Government's actions.

* Today we are faced with a general world economic **crisis**.

* There is a **crisis** in world liquidity, a **crisis** in world trading confidence.

* We are in a period of **crisis**, of over-production in primary industry.

* I do not seek to deny that there are problems/ But whether they are of **crisis** magnitude is a. question pf degree.

* .- Mr. Speaker, at last the House is about to debate the ministerial statement on the Cuban **crisis** which, on my motion, was placed on the notice-paper three weeks ago.

* I preface my question, which is addressed to the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry, by referring to the very critical1 resolution passed by this House on the behaviour of Russia towards Czechoslovakia in the recent **crisis**.

* We have had evidence of a wool **crisis** in New Zealand.

* I suggest that it would be very hard to distinguish the two types of quantitative control, and we should have slid back into the old system with all the disadvantages that I have enumerated already, unless, indeed, the Government has in mind meeting another exchange **crisis** in another way either by devaluation or by some other means.

* Those with wealth, power, and influence are enjoying this Government's measures to the full because they are able to make greater profits without making any corresponding contribution to the solution of the economic **crisis** which has been brought about by the Government.

* It has created a gold **crisis** around the world, it is bringing civil war into the United States and it is bringing the battle into the centres of American cities.

* Only time will show whether a serious **crisis** over our balance of payments can be avoided and whether the Menzies Government can survive.

* If it does not survive and a **crisis** is not avoided, that will be because you removed import controls in February, 1960.

* I think it will be remembered that the end of lend-lease between the United States of America and other countries brought about a **crisis**, particularly for Great Britain, which was a debtor nation at the time.

* I remember being in England in 1938 at the time of the Munich **crisis** when the situation was crucial.

* Some four years ago, on the occasion of the Suez **crisis**, he advocated full-blooded sanctions against Egypt.

* It is difficult to reconcile this with information that the British Government is believed to have informed the Australian Government a considerable time ago that it was prepared to evacuate the Mediterranean if Australia was convinced this was essential for the defence of Singapore, and that Britain offered to release 300 to 400 American planes under the lend-lease plan to Australia - an offer which ostensibly the Menzies Government delayed acting upon because of a political **crisis** at that time.

* Treaty and we depend on the South East Asia Treaty Organisation, but can anybody guarantee not only that the United States will come to our ass:stance in a real **crisis** but also that it could?

* That can only mean one thing, that in a time of **crisis** in Australian political affairs, a time when the subject under discussion was the question of Russian influence in this country and American participation in bases in this country, one of the members of this House was guilty of supporting, fostering and putting forward the views of the Russian Government.

* If a peace treaty were concluded there would be no Berlin **crisis** and no Berlin situation of any kind.

* We have arrived at a **crisis** in this country's history.

* I was encouraged because I believe that short of major escalation of the Vietnamese situation into war in South East Asia, we in Australia have longer than I imagined to prepare for a **crisis** which, when I left this country, seemed sure to come.

* In the Sydney " Daily Telegraph " of 23rd August, 1961, we had the headlines, " Unity tickets **crisis**".

* The **crisis** in wool is, therefore, a prime cause of the economic depression prevailing throughout Australia today.

* As for the statement that no one needs to be told anything precise in terms of labour and that the Government has no targets in mind for the industry, this only means that the situation is allowed to reach a **crisis** point and then the Government slams the axe down.

* I support it because I believe it is more in keeping with what is required in this **crisis** of mounting unemployment caused by the policies deliberately pursued by this Government.

* The failure of steel exports and the upsweep m steel imports during 1960 played a principal part in causing the balanceofpayments **crisis** and all that followed .

* Just before the military National Leadership Committee took control of the country away from the civilians recently, senior generals were so busy dealing with the political **crisis** that they scarcely could give attention to the biggest battle of the war at Dong Xoai.

* My comments tonight, which are not destructive by any means but are constructive, are designed specifically to prevent the kind of **crisis** that emerges periodically as a consequence of this Government's economic policy.

* Not only has the Opposition concerned itself with this subject, but the matter has also been brought to the attention of the Government by interested organisations, including the Teachers Federation, parents and friends associations, educationists and many others who believe that a **crisis** now exists in the Australian educational system at these levels.

* Believing that a **crisis** does exist, the Australian Labor Party took the opportunity to express its point of view in its policy speeches in 1966, 1963, 1961 and 1958.

* It is approaching the **crisis** in Australian education inversely.

* The gathering **crisis** in education can be stopped only by concentrated action at the Federal level.

* The Federal Government has shown either a complete lack of awareness of the gathering **crisis** or a depressing timidity in the face of one of the greatest challenges ever te confront this nation.

* The teaching **crisis** is inextricably linked with the steady deterioration of standards in our educational systems at the vital primary, secondary and technical levels.

* Persons who at one time showed indifference or a " ho-hum " attitude towards civil defence have at last been shaken by  President  Kennedy's appeals for greater effort, the worsening **crisis**, over Berlin, and Russian feats in rocketry and weapons .

* Because they have not been done, we are now faced with an emergency which will be part of a chronically ill **crisis** until our domestic economy is developed on a soundly planned national basis.

* Is he aware that this discontent is due mainly to the current extreme staffing **crisis**?

* I refer to the evidence of increased antiSemitism in the Soviet Union, especially since the Middle East **crisis**.

* Is he aware of the move at the United Nations to again attempt to reach a solution of the Suez **crisis** in the next few weeks?

* The Labour Party will be called in, if Australia becomes further involved in the war in Vietnam, to steer Australia through the **crisis**.

* Instead, as has been the case in the past, we have drifted from **crisis** to **crisis** and have dealt with each **crisis** hour by hour as it arrived.

* The year 1961 is definitely a year of **crisis**.

* Is the Minister aware that the citrus industry is facing a **crisis**, that a large portion of this year's crop will be dumped, that approximately 150,000 gallons of single strength juice were imported from Brazil and Italy for the year ended 30th June 1967 and that certain processors are using the importation of citrus juice as a means to keep local prices depressed?

* They now are confronted with the **crisis** that their actions have brought about.

* If this boycott is extended to Australia because of Australian support for the idea of the Federation of Malaysia - I know thai the  Deputy  Prime Minister cannot anticipate, a **crisis**,, which has not.

* In Victoria we have a near **crisis** in the State Electricity Commission.

* But since the Government's fiscal or commercial policies or the overseas **crisis** raise the threat of unemployment, resistance based on the fear of unemployment is shown to those policies.

* We should keep this in mind at a time when we are facing a balanceofpayments **crisis**.

* Hence we still have poverty in the midst of plenty; we still have one education **crisis** after another, we cannot make any real progress in social welfare and health; housing costs for many people are fantastic; and our cities grow more congested and irrational as they continue to grow bigger.

* Subsequent moves to have it reintroduced failed until another **crisis** - this time a power **crisis** - enabled a colleague of mine in the Tasmanian Parliament,  Mr John  Steer, after 10 years of effort, to convince the Tasmanian Government to reintroduce it in October of last year.

* We have seen very little evidence pf the fostering of this at the highest level, at the federal level, and this is what our education **crisis** urgently calls for.

* The first one he loved to talk about was the solving of the coal **crisis** in New South Wales and in Australia generally.

* He said that New South Wales is facing a **crisis** in its public hospitals.

* But I add the rider that some action must be taken now by the Government to ensure that the private sector of the economy makes its decisions in collaboration and in full co-operation with the Government in order to avoid an otherwise inevitable **crisis** in the future.

* They say, "We are just in a balance-of-payments **crisis** ".

* But to any one who looks carefully at the rate of increase in prices last year, which was between 4 per cent, and 5 per cent., and the rate at which they were obviously going to increase had the Government not taken these measures, it is obvious that the main purpose of the measures is not to meet the balance-of-payments **crisis** but to prevent inflation from getting out of hand.

* Allied to the problem of inflation, of course, is a balance-of-payments **crisis**.

* Our commitment to help Malaya against Communist activities was a very real one at a time of **crisis** for Malaya.

* We -have to unite as a nation io meet the terrible **crisis** that could be just around the corner.

* I am sure that the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Adermann)  is aware of the **crisis** in the sugar industry.

* An honourable member said before the suspension of the sitting that the wool industry is now facing a **crisis** in finding a market for its products.

* Not only is an investigation necessary, but an immediate grant should be made to the States to enable them to survive a **crisis** that now threatens education.

* To adopt the repressive and irrational methods suggested by the Premier of New South Wales and the honourable member for La Trobe is a sure way of converting a problem - at present a manageable and measureable problem - at universities into an explosive and endless **crisis**.

* In his speech today the Leader of the Opposition sought to take the Government to task on this score; he said that the statement of the Minister for External Affairs represents a turning away by the Government from any solution of the **crisis** in South Vietnam other- than a military solution.

* Conference declares that on' the Vietnam **crisis**.

* The word **crisis**' in relation to Navy pay was used.

* Indirectly, the people of Australia are probably recouped by virtue of the fact that the bounty affords Australia the protection of having available, in order to assist industrial production in a **crisis** or at any other time, this most important chemical product obtained from the processing of our own materials.

* Various Ministers, including  Senator Gorton  in recent times, have gone to a lot of trouble to argue that there is no **crisis** in education, that there is no special difficulty, and that adequate provision is being made in most places or everywhere; and in this debate on the Estimates this afternoon a striking example has been provided of the Government's neglect of the question.

* First of all, in respect of the aggregate, there is a **crisis** and a problem.

* I feel dismayed by the intensity with which responsible Ministers, such as  Senator Gorton,  who was recently concerned with this matter, and the Liberal Party Minister for Education in Victoria,  Mr. Bloomfield,  are going so much out of their way to try to show that there is no urgency and no **crisis** and that there is no need for priority to be given to education.

* I would be failing in my trust to those people I represent who have taken single unit farms, particularly orchard properties, if I did not say that at this time they are facing a real **crisis** over the future of their farms.

* The fact that they are so far-reaching and significant shows that the Government is facing a serious economic **crisis**.

* Has the Australian High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur been called in by Tun Abdul Razak for special defence aid to handle the racial **crisis** in western Malaysia?

* Suppose we had proclaimed the United Kingdom and France and Israel at the time of the Suez **crisis**.

* Referring again to this directory of progress, I find that unemployment, the effects of automation, health, education, the **crisis** in the building industry, hospital fees and prices are a few of the problems that the Government conveniently overlooks.

* I  turn from that to the very curious attitude adopted by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell)  this morning, namely, that the present position is not remotely analogous to the coal **crisis** of 1949.

* He said this morning that it is an absurdity to contend that this situation is vaguely analogous to the **crisis** in 1949.

* The honorable member has been ironed out and to-night we have seen him trying to get out from under when the **crisis** has arrived.

* This was at the time of the Coral Sea Battle during a **crisis** in Australia's history and when a lot of people in this place were very frightened.

* But at that time, when we were involved in war,  Dr. Friedman,  Lecturer in Laws, University College, London, wrote an important book, " The Crisis of the National State ", in which he raised this very issue.

* He said - 
When compared with the present wheat **crisis** all other crises in Australia in the past pale into insignificance.

* When the situation became critical, in November,  1960,  the official Labour policy - admitted by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell)  - was to correct the very real **crisis** in our balance of payments by re-imposing a system of import licences.

* Nobody denies that there was a foreign exchange **crisis** in November,  1960.

* The Leader of the Opposition himself said, and I quote from page  2861  of the relevant " Hansard "- 
Those were figures conceded by the Minister who, on other occasions, had said that there was no **crisis** in the coal-mining industry.

* Speaking for myself, and I believe for my electorate, I state clearly that if the Indonesian leaders ever misinterpret the constant, continuous and genuine offers of friendship which we have made to them over the years through our Minister as signs of weakness, vacillation or unwillingness to stand up and be counted in a **crisis**, they are making the greatest error of judgment in their nations' short history.

* They have made their views known in conferences with the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies),  by deputation and by inundating the Treasurer with letters emphasizing the **crisis** in local government.

* They have never obtained worthwhile action to meet the need to re-examine the financial **crisis** in local government.

* The Government had failed in its antiinflation expectations, because at the end of the year, after having removed import controls in the hope and belief that this would relieve inflation, the Government, according to the Minister for Trade, found itself on the razor's edge of an economic **crisis**.

* However, facing at the end of 1960 the possible **crisis** in overseas commitments, the Government had two possible courses of action before it.

* It is the fluctuation of imports that has forced a **crisis** on the Australian economy with which the Government has wrestled throughout its term of office.

* In times of **crisis** and need, the time taken to build the ships in Australia could be shortened, as in England.

* The Australian Country Party, of which I am proud to be a member, has published a booklet entitled " The Crisis in Farm Costs and Incomes".

* Does any one still regard his activities in the Suez **crisis** as a great success?

* The outcome of the **crisis** there will have profound implications reaching far beyond Asia.

* The outcome of the **crisis** there will have profound implications reaching far beyond Asia.

* I wish, however, to establish in the minds of honourable members the simple proposition that foreign affairs today are much more extensive than any particular **crisis**, and when our gaze is fixed on the dramatic waterfalls of history we should not cease to be aware of the hundreds of miles of river that flow above the falls and the hundreds of miles below.

* I refer the Minister for Education and Science to the **crisis** which has arisen in Queensland as a result of the attempt by the State Government there to devalue professional standards among teachers.

* If so, will the Minister give an assurance that when considering this, along with the organization's other proposals which appear quite positive in their objective of meeting a possible **crisis**, he will also bear in mind that a big percentage of the Australian work-force is employed in secondary industries?

* Sterling is facing a **crisis**.

* The price will not settle down at its present level for the very good reason that the surplus will ultimately be consumed; but while the present situation lasts the sugar industry faces a **crisis**, and some measure of assistance will have to be given to the people in the industry.

* It is a tragedy that when a **crisis** arises in Australia, we rush hither and thither trying to do those 
The basic reason is that the drought on the south coast is reaching such **crisis** proportions that the matter of Commonwealth drought assistance needs the attention and debate of this House.

* The whole question had been the subject of neglect and our output of graduates had reached the level of a national **crisis**.

* To date, this request has been ignored by the Government and the **crisis** continues, a **crisis** that can have far-reaching effects on the welfare of the people of this country.

* a three-fold **crisis** exists, shortage of teachers, a tidal wave of students and insatiable demands for school accommodation beyond the resources of the States.

* Is it a fact that many Queensland cities and towns, because of unemployment, have been suffering **crisis** conditions for some considerable time and that no remedial action has been taken by the Commonwealth or State Governments despite repeated requests from the trade union movement for urgent assistance?

* This development was associated to a very large extent with the closing of the Suez Canal at the time of the **crisis** over its control.

* If we wait until events happen on our doorstep there will be no possibility of organising Australian industry adequately to meet a **crisis**.

* Will the Prime Minister or the Treasurer make a statement to Parliament at the earliest practicable time about what needs to be done to safeguard the Australian economy from the ill effects of the British devaluation, the gold **crisis** and the United Kingdom Budget?

* To-night he talks as though the **crisis** were new, but in August he said - 
It seems to me that nothing is being done in these measures to reduce what the Trea surer said were three diseases of the economy - share speculation, consumer credit, and purely financial speculation.

* He said that the building up of the motor vehicle industry had played an excessive part in our present **crisis**.

* No new **crisis** has arisen.

* This sort of action has been taken to help other industries in times of **crisis** when there has been a lag in return from overseas markets.

* Only yesterday, the honorable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr. Allan Fraser)  became excited in this place because he thought that the House should be debating a major matter of consequence - namely, the Cuban **crisis**.

* Undoubtedly, the Cuban **crisis** is a very important matter.

* That being so, it is rather surprising that he did not bring this matter forward, or at least notify me as the representative of the Government, until 1 1 o'clock last night, after we had despatched a letter to the acting Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Whitlam)  telling him that the first item of business to be brought forward by the Government to-day would be a debate on the Cuban **crisis**.

* In other words, in a session in which we have had more scope for private members' business than we have had in any other session in recent years, not only was the Cuban **crisis** to be regarded as of secondary importance to private members' business but this matter, which he now says affects the wellbeing of all Australians, was also to be so regarded.

* Not one honorable member, if he is objective, will deny that for an honorable member of this National Parliament to make statements of the kind that have been made by the honorable member for Grayndler, particularly during the present time of **crisis**, is a very serious matter.

* In an article in the Launceston " Examiner " on 22nd July this year Frank Mangan stated, under a heading: " World's Driest Continent: Water **crisis** in Australia " - 
.- I want to say, without offence to the honorable member for Isaacs  (Mr. Haworth),  that I have never heard such flapdoodle in my life.

* He ambled on and gave no concrete rebuttals of our charges, nor did he attempt in any way to come to grips with the problem which has caused us in the Opposition - the alternative government - to bring to this House the facts of the **crisis** that exists outside.

* If the level of funds allocated under the new Commonwealth Aid Roads Act is to be restricted to that mentioned by the Prime Minister in his policy speech, how does the Government propose to meet the **crisis** on capital city roads referred to by the capital city lord mayors in a recent submission to the Commonwealth?

* It is hardly surprising that by 1962 the Cabinet's nerve was entirely shattered: the extraordinarily perverse handling of the exchange **crisis** and subsequent events serve only to illustrate the general proposition that a country gets the government it deserves.

* I refer to members of the Teachers Federation, who have repeatedly pointed out the **crisis** that exists in education at all levels in every State of the Commonwealth.

* Would the publication have provided a fairer picture of the current Australian education situation if it had mentioned that the States are now trying to meet **crisis** conditions by placing large orders for portable classrooms, by scouring the country for casual teachers and by insisting that secondary school classes be increased in size by up to 20 per cent.?

* But, at the same time, my sense of justice was such that I could see no great virtue in making a **crisis** out of a situation of that kind; so I decided that, in the normal course of events, when cheques had to be presented to a charitable organization, they ought to be despatched by mail wherever that was deemed to be expedient and consistent with the wishes of the organization concerned.

* But they overlook the important fact that education authorities from one end of Australia to the other have advised this Government that, because of the insufficiency of funds provided by the Commonwealth, a **crisis** has now developed in education.

* A **crisis** has developed in education and that **crisis** is due entirely to lack of funds.

* The article is headed, " Home Building Crisis Demands Action ", and reads - 
The Leader of the Opposition and other members opposite have drawn red herrings across the path.

* One of them is that Australia should retain the right in moments of **crisis**, when perhaps this communications station is needed for instant nuclear retaliation, for the Government to hold up proceedings until it has made up its mind whether a crucial message should be passed on.

* From 1920 onwards there was never an economic **crisis** or an economic difficulty confronting any government of Australia, irrespective of its political complexion, that was not linked intimately with the price being received by the wool-growers of this country.

* It needed this **crisis** to bring home the fact that, until this foundation had been laid, Australia's ability to defend herself must steadily diminish in relation to the military power of an enemy which did possess adequate factories.

* He says that there is no **crisis** in education - that any problem that has existed has been solved.

* Senator Gorton,  who is the Minister in charge of education - or, rather, the Minister in charge of no education - has denied that there is a **crisis** in education.

* The Minister in charge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research made his denial of the existence of a **crisis** in education in the very same week in which secondary school teachers in Victoria decided to take the extreme step of holding a one day stoppage in protest against the condition of the education system in Victoria, which is a conservative State.

* They know that there is a **crisis** in education even if the Commonwealth Minister in Charge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research does not.

* To these newspapers the mere statement of that situation represented complacency, a lack of understanding, a failure to realise there was a **crisis**, or something of that sort.

* I was also taken to task because I had the temerity to question the motives of some of the people who, in putting forward their claims for an inquiry into primary and secondary education and insisting that there was a **crisis** for which a crash programme was necessary, quite deliberately distorted the facts and, indeed, apparently deliberately, forgot to mention the tremendous advance in education and the priorities given to education in Australia in recent years.

* Its availability as a pharmaceutical benefit is restricted to the treatment of what is known as status asthmaticus, which is a severe **crisis** of asthma.

* Did he later in the year, when announcing the Government's plans to deal with the economic **crisis**, say that one of the objectives of the Government was to check excessive spending and thus reduce the demand for imports?

* On behalf of those servicemen who may be separated from their families or housed,
              at great cost, in unsatisfactory accommodation, 1 earnestly request urgent action to
              meet a **crisis** so rapidly approaching.

* We have the historic incident of the Suez Canal **crisis** some four years ago.

* Although the Minister promised us nothing yesterday and gave a very barren reply to the question I put to him, I think that if the Australian National Line comes to our rescue, especially with " Bass Trader ", we may steer clear of a **crisis**.

* Only a small proportion of the nearly 700 growers involved' in the Suez **crisis** have their entire apple crop or pear crop written off.

* The Opposition is actually speaking on behalf of every one of nearly 700 fruit growers desperately concerned in the Suez **crisis** who have had at least part of their year's work wiped out in a flash.

* Only this Federal Government can now help them as it has helped many other producers in times of similar **crisis**.

* However, no **crisis** has ever been the same as this.

* This **crisis** is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth.

* An unprecedented **crisis** deserves an unprecedented answer.

* We are being forced to depend on foreign suppliers of spare parts, which in a **crisis** might not reach us.

* Can he inform the House whether the Commonwealth Department of Works has been successful in improving on the time set for the construction of the Pitt Street Telephone Exchange, thus eliminating the **crisis** period that was adverted to during the deliberations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on this matter?

* Contrary to some views, the wheat industry has not been heavily protected; the little protection it has had is not the cause of the current **crisis**; and it is unreasonable to claim that the Government should have 'curbed' wheat years ago.

* I think that every authority that has reported on education has said that a **crisis** exists and that the **crisis** will get worse as the population increases, until about 1970.

* Eventually ihe documents were tabled and there was a considerable constitutional **crisis**.

* As we have a Suez Canal **crisis** today, so did we have one in December 1956.

* The former Prime Minister figured disastrously in the 1956 **crisis**.

* The Australian Labour Party unanimously and resolutely opposes conscription because it is unjust, unnecessary and inefficient and because its introduction brings unwarranted tension and **crisis** into the situation.

* But, if there is flexibility, why is nothing flexible being done in the present **crisis**?

* I add, briefly, that 3,200 people from all over Australia attended a national convention in Sydney recently and pleaded to the Commonwealth, to the States and to any one who would listen, for help in the education **crisis**.

* 1 ask a question of the Minister for Defence regarding certain Press headlines which slate that a **crisis** surrounds the production of defence equipment by Australian manufacturers.

* Can the Minister say whether a **crisis** does exist and, if so, what is being done about it?

* In that regard, 1 should like to direct the attention of the House to an excellent letter by  Mr. James  S. Colman, architect and town planner, relating to the Sydney Harbour **crisis**, which appeared in the " Australian " of 25th August.

* The State Minister for Housing has denied that there is a housing **crisis**, but for those people who cannot get a house it is a very serious **crisis**.

* It was appointed to report on the land and housing **crisis** in Western Australia.

* 12 - Cuban Crisis - Ministerial Statement - Motion for Printing Paper - Resumption of debate upon the motion, That the Paper be printed.

* He says the States are doing a good job in the education field and he does not think it is necessary to react to the present position as a **crisis** or as deserving special Commonwealth consideration.

* In conclusion, I want to say that the Government must recognize, first, that there is a very definite **crisis** in Austraiian education, and that this appears at all levels of the educational structure.

* Thirdly, whilst this mass of citizens are responsible - 
Some never recover from this first financial **crisis**,'  Mrs Gunton  said.

* The outcome of the **crisis** there will have profound implications reaching far beyond Asia.

* During the election campaign the Government made two promises in respect of the housing **crisis**.

* He is reported in the "Daily Telegraph " of 1 5th November, only fifteen days before the election, as having said - 
The second proposal which the Government was going to introduce to cure the housing **crisis** involved the creation of an insurance corporation.

* On this subject the Prime Minister, as reported in the " Age " of 22nd November last, said - 
The Menzies Government probably will not last a year and a **crisis** will certainly come within eighteen months.

* In fact, the Suez **crisis**, which occurred six years after the Prime Ministers' memorable statement, found this country still completely unprepared for war and spending more than 70 per cent, of its annual defence allocation on administration and man-power.

* Having now come through the **crisis**, there is no doubt that the unity and moral standing of the Commonwealth throughout the world will be increased.

* Mr Whitlam claimed yesterday that the **crisis** over the Fill resulted from over-hasty action by the Menzies Government in 1963.

* But I want to ask, further, of the Minister, why should we wait for a time of **crisis** for an interlocking of these three agreements?

* This question might seem unreal because the **crisis** is already here.

* In Adelaide on November 13 last,  Mr. Holt  denied Australia was facing an inflation **crisis**.

* The Menzies Government probably will not last a year and a **crisis** will certainly come within eighteen months.

* Let me now refer to the **crisis** in our rural industries.

* President Thieu and Vice-President Ky already face a **crisis**.

* Even in that time of great national **crisis**, trie Labour Administration of the d'ay Was thinking of the later years because it knew that pe'ople so' easily forgettheir obligations fo servicemen and' others.

* As a result, if a **crisis** should arise, we might easily find that social services will have to be cut because the basis that was set down by  Mr. Chifley  for the maintenance of social services has been destroyed by this Government.

* lt fails to recognise the serious **crisis** in education.

* The Cuban situation, I think, has two aspects: First, there is the **crisis** of 23rd, 24th and 25th October, which involved what was called the " confrontation " of American and Russian ships in the Caribbean Sea, and perhaps a somewhat longer **crisis** during the month of October in which there was a kind of confrontation of missile bases in Cuba and an invasion was expected by the Government of Cuba from outside.

* I think that the greatest defect in the consideration of the Cuban **crisis** is that, on the whole, it has been confined to the immediate events of October, and hardly any consideration has been given to the circumstances back to 1956.

* On 25th October, in the middle of the Cuban **crisis**, I took the opportunity, in a debate on defence, to raise the matter to the discomfort, I know, of a large number of members.

* But no one can correctly say that members of this House have really been able to direct their attention to discussing the **crisis** or the difficulties of Cuba.

* First of all, let us look at two aspects which I think I can devote some time to discussing: First, there was the **crisis**.

* This Government, I suggest, failed in respect of the **crisis** in two respects.

* What emerges from the Cuban situation is this: First, there is a need to back United Nations intervention in every **crisis**, to obtain first a cease-fire, or a cease-action, so that there may be negotiation.

* Every one in this country remembers the Suez **crisis**.

* He went to see Nasser and just to make it look as if he were really sincere on the issue, the Minister for the Army  (Mr. Cramer)  said that 20,000 Australian troops would support him in the Suez **crisis**.

* To our eternal disgrace, indelibly recorded in the annals of history, is the fact that the Prime Minister of Australia supported that man against other members of the Britsih Commonwealth and people in other parts of the world who had stood behind the British Commonwealth and Australia in times of **crisis**.

* It fails to recognise the serious **crisis** in education.

* It fails to recognise the serious **crisis** in education.

* Let us make a deliberate decision instead of drifting from **crisis** to **crisis**, as we do now.

* I think that the Government will find that there is grave concern amongst the people at the implications of the American economic **crisis** and the visit of that prominent American to this country, with the announcement almost overnight that we were buying into this war.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  is facing the most serious **crisis** within his own party for many years.

* It is becoming increasingly apparent that a **crisis** point must soon be reached in rural shires unless there is a radical alteration in the method of obtaining finance for local government.

* The Commonwealth is entering a twilight zone of **crisis**.

* Only credit would have accrued to any government that took the victims of the disaster into its confidence completely in this time of **crisis**.

* I  agree entirely with the honorable member for Gwydir that a **crisis** has occurred in northern New South Wales.

* This is the nature of the **crisis** that we face today and the challenge that is upon us.

* The policies of this Government have been responsible for one **crisis** after another, culminating in the man-made depression of 1961 from which we have not yet recovered.

* The Berlin **crisis**, I think, provides a very good example of this.

* In 1953, when there were localized' revolts in- various parts of East Germany, the Western powers, realizing the extreme danger of this situation from the standpoint of world war, had to call off the pressure, and the radio stations beamed out to the people of East Germany messages advising them' to support their government at the end of that **crisis**.

* I remind the right honourable gentleman of the question that I asked on 20lh May about the **crisis** in sterling and the stand-by loan made to Britain by the International Monetary Fund.

* Has there been a decline in our overseas gold reserves of 
The main subject on which I wish to speak concerns East African people who, as most honorable members know, have reached a position of **crisis** in their lives.

* No people can be certain that in times of **crisis** they will receive the assistance of others with whom they are in agreement, but we are as sure as we possibly can be in such circumstances.

* Unless we can make such a demonstration to them we certainly cannot expect their support in time of **crisis**.

* I am not prepared to trust to the emotions of an Attorney-General of the future, unless it happens to be my friend the honorable member for Werriwa  (Mr. Whitlam)  to deliberate in moments of **crisis** on emotional matters of treason, treachery and loyalty, in such a way that he will protect the people.

* I hope that in the future we will get to a healthier state of mind and a healthier atmosphere where members of Parliament still belonging to parties, still subscribing to a basic core of philosophy and policy, will still have the feeling that they can speak in some kind of revaluation of even their own parties' policies without being accused of factionalism or of bringing about a **crisis** or chaos.

* When a **crisis** such as that over Abyssinia or that over Munich, or a situation such as the one that led up to the war arose, although  Mr. Curtin  did not disclose anything confidential to Caucus, he was able to give advice about policy decisions because he was informed.

* According to the Herald of 1/8/40 the Farmers' Wheat Adjustment Board contended that 75  per  cent of Victoria's 13,000 wheat-growers were then facing, a financial, **crisis**.

* One cannot say that circumstances existed that precipitated the **crisis**.

* Surely this Government must realize that there is a **crisis** in education in Australia.

* No matter how stubborn it is, how great is its desire to maintain the status quo, how smug and complacent it is, how certain it is that everything is all right, surely the Government must realize, if it surveys the world scene, that a major **crisis** in education exists and that greater priority must be given to education.

* There is no organisation capable of cushioning the blow in any international **crisis**.

* So I say,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  that the Government can have no clear conscience as a consequence of the **crisis** which beset the world as late as last week.

* Since the Berlin **crisis** the Canadian Government has speeded up its civil defence programme very considerably indeed.

* If a **crisis** occurred, even though it was not as great as that which I think is possible, in the absence of such centres of administration, communication and control we would have to depend upon martial law and martial government.

* Was there any consultation on the Cuban **crisis** between the governments of Australia and Great Britain prior to the presentation of his statement last Tuesday?

* In the main the increased acreage has meant a benefit to the Australian sugar grower in this time of **crisis**.

* That Bill was introduced in 1962 because of  a **crisis** in the butter industry.

* In 1 957, the Labour Party said that, unless something was done for education in Australia, the **crisis** that was already developing would continue until it became so large that it would be almost beyond solution.

* We said that there was a **crisis** in education and funds should be made available to the 
States to help them solve the **crisis**.

* The necessity for imediate action to relieve the **crisis** in Australian education; 
Our 1963 policy emphasizes that we believe in a dual education system in Australia.

* Our policy also states that immediate action should be taken to relieve the **crisis** in Australian education.

* The Minister for Primary Industry gave us an outline of the situation that arose in 1961 under the bad old order1 when there was a **crisis** in the industry.

* Why could not the Federal Government treat the present situation as an economic **crisis** to  a  vital export industry, especially as this industry will be hardest hit by the freight rises?

* Having decided that a major **crisis** exists in the fruit industry, why could not the Federal Government agree to subsidise the increased freight for at least the 1967 season?

* Even the **crisis** in Czechoslovakia is a mini-**crisis** compared to the shocking conditions that have developed in Nigeria.

* The course that the Opposition is taking in this House and in another place is designed to register in the strongest possible terms our protest against the manner in which the Government has shown its contempt for the Parliament, broken undertakings to the Premiers, ignored public opinion, overridden considerations of the public interest, dealt in a completely cavalier way with fundamental constitutional issues, and, through an unfortunate co-mixture of arrogance, duplicity and incompetence, generated a completely unnecessary **crisis** in civil aviation in this country.

* The inescapable fact is that the Government's mishandling of the matter has created a **crisis** over an issue which could and should have been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties long ago.

* But in amplifying the Prime Minister's remarks of last night, and indeed, in generally agreeing with them, I trust that his eloquent exposition of the expediency of Australia's policy has been expanded by my expression of the morality and humanity behind Australia's actions, in this tragic and needless **crisis**.

* I am not at all impressed with the honorable member for Lilley who says in effect: " This is a quick response to a **crisis**.

* Our first complaint is that the Bill should not be necessary - because the Government could easily have taken action to avoid the **crisis** which it now claims to be facing up to.

* It moved an amendment to the Estimates for the specific purpose of drawing attention to this very **crisis**, and the amendment was rejected.

* The Government was warned that this **crisis** would occur.

* The fact that a **crisis** is upon us and is being felt by the homeless is manifesting itself in a million unhappy ways such as people crowding in with their in-laws and families living in rooms, shanties and temporary dwellings.

* After a politically contrived financial **crisis** - I admit there were problems but nothing in the nature of a **crisis** - engineered, by the Socialists to enable them to re-introduce their antedeluvian sledgehammer form of economics, concerning some of which we had a lesson a few minutes ago, Great Britain is rapidly becoming once more the austere unhappy island of the postwar socialist days.

* It needed this **crisis** to bring home the fact that, until this foundation had been laid, Australia's ability to defend herself must steadily diminish in relation to the military power of an enemy which did possess adequate factories; and that any overseas force she formed could consist only of men who must be equipped by her allies.

* I think we can be confident that the next time a **crisis** arises in these fields - because they are always crises, there is never a trivial case of extradition - Australia will be in a better position both to ensure that persons who committed crimes in Australia are brought to book and to ensure that persons who are alleged to have committed crimes overseas and who are now in Australia are not extradited except for good reason.

* But this Government still wallows in indifference and unconcern, and seems to indicate that no great **crisis** exists.

* While thousands of people are in need of homes, we think also of the great **crisis** that besets this country in regard to slum clearance.

* We feel that this is an opportunity to place before the Parliament a consideration of some of the areas of **crisis**, as we call them, in Australian education.

* Of course there are areas of **crisis** in Australian education.

* I now come to the most important single industry in Australia, the wool industry, which is now facing its greatest **crisis** since the depression years of the  1930s.

* I want to concentrate my remarks on the **crisis** in Vietnam, because I believe that this great **crisis** could escalate into a world war.

* We said that there ought to be a cease fire and negotiations to try to settle the matter round the conference table, because we believe that there is no military solution to the **crisis** in Vietnam.

* In this **crisis** they have been drafted without being given the right, as the Prime Minister was given the right, to determine whether or not to go to war.

* It has repeatedly called for a national overseas shipping line and, at the time when **crisis** threatened Australian trade due to the 1962 British attempt to enter the European Common Market, issued a pamphlet emphasising our need for independent shipping services.

* If there were an emergency like the Suez Canal **crisis** in 1956, when our Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies)  distinguished himself, and world shipping were disrupted and scarce, what would happen to Australian men left in the Antarctic without shipping services?

* One would almost be disappointed if one were to pick up a newspaper one morning and find that the headlines did not indicate a **crisis** of some kind in our community.

* We all  aTe  familiar with headlines such as " Crisis in Education ".

* We all recall headlines such as " Crisis in Education ", " Crisis in Hospital Finances ", " Crisis in Defence ", " Crisis in the Future Growth of the Economy ", " Crisis in Northern Development " Crisis in Shipping Freights ", " Crisis in Road Construction ".

* In 1943, in the midst of the greatest **crisis** this country has known the then Prime Minister, the late John Curtin, saw fit to appoint a select committee of members of this Parliament to consider repatriation matters.

* Under this arrangement outlined by the Prime Minister, if an unhappy **crisis** arrives, the nations of South East Asia know where we are; small as it may be, it is a clear-cut identification of our intent.

* It would certainly be no deterrent for Australia to be huffing and puffing, even in time of **crisis**, behind a' wall' of 'coastline cosiness'.

* The most glaring omission from the Budget, as it affects primary producers, and certainly as it affects Queensland and the drought **crisis** there, was in its failure to make any statement at all on the wheat **crisis** or about what the Government intends to do about the worsening drought, particularly in those coastal areas where the Government can do something, particularly in those areas where water is available.

* It has stood up to every type of economic trial, and **crisis** after **crisis** has been dealt with effectively within the framework of the general policy.

* Never again will the United States Congress give a President an open cheque as President Johnson was given in the Gulf of Tonkin **crisis**.

* There has never been a month since the war when some political **crisis** somewhere has not hit world headlines and often stayed there for a long time.

* We had the Berlin **crisis**, Israel, Suez, Sharpeville in South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Formosa, Cuba, South Viet Nam, North Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia coming into and going out of the world's news almost continuously.

* The Minister for Health said at that time - 1 have no need to remind you that as a result of the Stoller Report, the Commonwealth Government in  collaboration with the  States agreed to make a sum of ten million pounds available to the States to meet a **crisis** and the first point I want to make is this: 1 believe that the Government made that contribution believing that would be the first and last time it would be called upon  to make  a capital grant to meet a **crisis**.

* If we want to find the real **crisis** in education, we can do so readily enough.

* I say now what I said some 10 years ago and was criticised for saying and that is that there is a real **crisis** in the private sector of education.

* The people of this country are entitled to know that their money is being spent in a way that will enable us to meet any **crisis**, should it arise.

* Tonight the Prime Minister referred to the fact, although the Royal Commissioner did not, that some of the officers on " Voyager " did not know how to inflate the rafts and that an officer is alleged to have stood in the **crisis** reading instructions.

* I appeal to the Government to take into account its lack of action in making grants available to Queensland in the past and to do something to meet this **crisis** which exists, and improve the prospects for Bowen, Townsville and Rockhampton.

* A  **crisis** does threaten in north Queensland.

* Are the Berlin **crisis**, 2,000,000 people and 300 square miles of land worth a third world war? "

* Let us have done with this manufactured **crisis**.

* It is the Government to-day that is talking about a **crisis**.

* Who is talking in terms of **crisis** and terms of panic?

* Are we in a position of **crisis**?

* I cannot admit that there is a **crisis**.

* In 1950, the Commission granted a prosperity loading of 1 a week, and in 1952 an economic **crisis** developed.

* In 1954 there was a very considerable increase in margins, and a **crisis** ensued, culminating in the horror Budget of, I think, 1956.

* What does the present **crisis** mean to the many small countries around the world?

* Schools have been operating under emergency conditions for at least a decade, they are at present attempting to function under almost intolerable conditions and Strain, and, owing to steadily and rapidly increasing enrolments, they face a continuing **crisis** for the full extent of the foreseeable future.

* Is it any wonder that professional bodies and public-spirited organizations in the community are telling the Government that there is a **crisis** in our education system?

* First, he said there were bills dealing with the **crisis** in South East Asia.

* There were bills dealing with this **crisis** last year and they also were brought in and the last two sitting weeks of last year.

* But what do we say when a parliament closes down for eight months at a time of **crisis**?

* The Minister for Trade and Industry was a member of the Government at the time of the Suez **crisis**.

* I do not think he was very pleased about the attitude of the Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies)  when that right honorable gentleman forthrightly came out in support of the United Kingdom during that **crisis**.

* Has he seen a story, which appeared in the newspapers and was adopted by the Leader of the Opposition, to the effect that there is an unpublished understanding between the United States of America and Australia that provides for close and continuous consultation between Washington and Canberra about the use of facilities at the naval communication station at North West Cape in any South-East Asian **crisis** in which Australia and the United States may have divergent views?

* The cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide will face **crisis** after **crisis** in the future with water shortages.

* Can you not see, in that far-distant suburb of Brisbane, the honorable member for Moreton wondering whether these people whom he had condemned would realize that, to use an Australianism, he was not fair dinkum, that he did not really mean what he had said about them, that he really hoped they would forgive him and support him in his real **crisis**?

* At the heart of the present **crisis** in Commonwealth/State financial relations is the refusal of the Federal Liberal Government to accept any direct responsibility for hospitals and government schools, the greatest burdens on State budgets, and its refusal to accept responsibility for the plight of local and semi-government authorities which bear the whole burden of the provision of services for capitals and regional centres.

* The present **crisis** in financial relationships is as much a matter of the pressures on local and semi-government authorities as of the squeeze on the States.

* The easing of the depreciation allowances is a trifling contribution to a **crisis** situation.

* The Government is following the same course of action, or rather inaction, that it has followed over the past few years of ignoring the pending **crisis** in the hope that it will go away.

* In his speech on Vietnam on Tuesday last, the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr. Hasluck)  attributed all the blame for the recent **crisis** in South East Asia to the North Vietnamese and People's China.

* I ask why members on the Government side have refrained from mentioning this important fact with relation to the present **crisis** in Vietnam.

* Many of our public services such as education and hospitalization have reached a **crisis**.

* In 1957, when thousands of miners had been displaced from the coal industry as a result of mechanization, he had the audacity to stand up at a civic function in Newcastle and say, "There is no **crisis** in the coal industry to-day.

* I feel that the Minister, because of his unsympathetic attitude, is a most unsuitable person to deal with such matters, particularly in view of his utterances about the **crisis** in the coal industry.

* Government admits, we have an economic **crisis** - such a **crisis** as to require new financial and economic measures on the part of the Government.

* Knowing, as we do, that wages have been pegged, that pensions have been pegged, that there has been a fall in rural incomes, that secondary industries are in a state of **crisis**, we have no right to do what has been suggested by the Attorney-General and supported by a number of members on the Government side.

* I can remember attending in Brisbane a meeting of the Australian Animal Industry Committee at which it was said that the beef industry was facing a **crisis** because our only real market was the European market which was dominated by Great Britain.

* Out of that **crisis** we entered in 1958 the American market.

* Monetary policy can cause a **crisis** and depression, but it cannot cure such a condition.

* After the difficulties we have faced in recent years, with money **crisis** seeming to follow money **crisis**, the completion of the agreement first of all to activate the scheme then to allocate the drawing rights will, I think, be of enormous benefit in the improvement of world trade and the facilitation of the means by which world trade may be carried on.

* Can the Minister for External Affairs give the House any information about the food **crisis** in India?

* Has Australia played its part fully in assisting in this **crisis**?

* In opening up this subject, I wish to return for a moment to the Cuban nuclear **crisis**, because that was the first real nuclear **crisis** in the world.

* That nuclear **crisis** set precedents of which I think we would do well to take note.

* Secondly, in his measures to deal with the **crisis** caused by the Soviet Union,  President  Kennedy detailed and timed his programme in such a way that the Soviet Union would have plenty of time to consider its next step, in order to avoid the tragedy of some " spasm reaction " - that is not my term; it has been used by other people - which could occur without proper thought and which could plunge the world into nuclear war.

* The present nuclear powers and future historians probably will examine that second lesson, which would be most important in relation to any future nuclear **crisis**.

* Since the Cuban **crisis** there has been a drawing-off by the Soviet Union in certain fields of conflict.

* The first example of that is that there has not been a major **crisis** over Berlin.

* One might have expected such a **crisis** before now.

* I firmly believe that such a **crisis** would have occurred if the Soviet Union had not learnt a lesson from the Cuban incident.

* But I believe that the most important factor that has had an impact is the fact and lesson of the Cuban **crisis**.

* While we have had from the Opposition these warnings, this calamity howling and this knocking of Australia, we have not yet heard from supporters of the Labour Party any constructive suggestions for the future of Australia, lt is frankly admitted that not only Australia, but also all the other countries in the free world are facing times of **crisis**.

* We move from one **crisis** to another, and the devoted attention of men in all the parliaments of the world is needed to get all the people who are free out of their troubles from time to time.

* If the difficulties cannot be overcome, a **crisis** will rapidly develop.

* Indeed, a **crisis** has arrived, because already water restrictions have been imposed in Alice Springs though this is only the beginning of the summer.

* fails to meet the **crisis** in education by making an emergency grant of at least 10,000,000 to the States; 
But I want to pass from this matter of immediate concern, the Bidault interview, to parallel instances of the interference of this Government in the autonomy of the national broadcasting system and, consequentially, in the democratic freedoms of the people, by endeavouring to foist on the people a system of controls.

* Only a few months ago, on 29th October, 1962, to be precise, Doctor Peter Russo, an international commentator, delivered an address over Station 3LO in Melbourne on the then recent Cuban **crisis**.

* It was an impartial assessment of the conflict or **crisis** that had occurred.

* The Prime Minister has admitted that a **crisis** is facing Australia.

* In a similar situation in 1932, after a long conference between the State Premiers, it was suggested in the Parliament of Victoria that wages should be reduced to meet a **crisis** which, incidentally, was largely caused by the Bruce-Page Government.

* The traffic **crisis** focuses our attention on the appalling and inevitable inadequacies of public investment under this Government.

* In 1962-63 it was 8.7 per cent, despite our great need for national development and despite the education **crisis** in this country.

* It was .certainly done a couple of weeks ago in the case of the **crisis** over Cuba.

* The State Minister for Housing denies that there is a housing **crisis**, but for those people who cannot get a house it is a very serious **crisis** indeed.

* The  President  lays the blame for the sudden **crisis** on Russia's intrusion into the western hemisphere.

* For my part, I think the Australian people hope this present **crisis** will not end in armed conflict, but will be resolved peacefully through the United Nations, the seventeenth anniversary of whose birth occurs to-day.

* As I have said, the cost of servicing our debt, that is, the balance of property income payable overseas, has been rising significantly, but it has to be remembered that a great deal of money is left in Australia by foreign investors and this can be withdrawn and taken overseas in time of **crisis**.

* Therefore, in addition to meeting the ever increasing burden of the cost of servicing our debt, we are faced with the possible withdrawal of a very considerable amount of money in any kind of financial **crisis**, and this exposes the economy to all sorts of pressures.

* So, the number of applications lodged with the Housing Commission for houses in the Wollongong area in no way reflects the real housing **crisis** in that great city.

* In ten years of making speeches about housing in this chamber, I have rarely missed an opportunity to tell the Government that this **crisis** will arise in the period from 1965 to 1970.

* The next point in our leader's proposed amendment is that the Government has failed to recognise the serious **crisis** in education.

* The State Governments have strained their Budget expenditures, the proportion devoted to education now being approximately 25 per cent., in playing their part to cope with this **crisis**.

* Only the other day, in my electorate, where there are many schools, 98 per cent, of the teachers attended a meeting called to discuss the education **crisis** that prevails in New South Wales.

* This **crisis** should not be attributed to the administration of the State Government.

* fails to attack the **crisis** in education in Australia in the areas of greatest need; 
This is a major piece of legislation.

* Evidence of a mounting **crisis** in Australian education can be deduced from a host of sources.

* This is a suggestion that has been made and supported by educationalists, parents and citizens associations and people from all walks of life who believe that they have some responsibility in the field of education and who acknowledge that there is a **crisis** in education.

* I am not going to say that that was unwise, because at that time there was a major **crisis** and we wanted American help at any price, but let there be no talk now about our sacrificing any sovereignty by allowing the United States to rent 28 square miles of land at North West Cape for a radio station which will merely relay commands from America to American submarines, surface vessels or aircraft.

* During the Cuban **crisis** President Kennedy pointed out that he was not able to get in touch with Khrushchev for a day or so because no channel of communication was available.

* At the time of the Cuban **crisis**, every diplomatic channel throughout the world was clogged; urgent messages could not be sent back and forth because too many people were endeavouring to make use of the lines at the one time.

* I believe that every Australian should feel proud of the task performed and the responsibility undertaken 'by the Prime Minister in connexion with the Suez **crisis**.

* I repeat that when we realize the situation that faced the nations in connexion with the Suez **crisis** we have just cause for feeling great pride in the task the Prime Minister performed on that occasion.

* The situation has reached **crisis** point.

* The honourable member who just resumed his seat rightly referred to the **crisis** within the Australian wool industry.

* This **crisis** is all the more serious because of the fact that Australia produces about two-thirds of the world's exported wool.

* The Budget fails to appreciate the serious **crisis** that exists in education.

* In Newcastle last Mondayleaders of the Building Workers' Industrial Union met to discuss the **crisis** in the industry.

* Does machinery exist for a joint approach by Commonwealth countries when any member country is facing a state of **crisis** brought about by drought, flood, famine or other catastrophe?

* Then, of course, there is no real indication of a feeling of urgency in regard to the housing **crisis** and the education deficiencies of Australia.

* Earlier I suggested to the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr. Hasluck)  that he might make this statement tomorrow, after which we could have a real debate on what Australia's attitude ought to be in the light of the Vietnam **crisis**, in the light of the Malaysian-Indonesian **crisis** and in the light of Cyprus.

* If so, to what extent will Australia he able to contribute to the alleviation of this **crisis**?

* Whenever this country has been faced with a national **crisis**, the Australian people have always turned to Labor.

* They did it in World War I, they did the same in World War II, and now that the wheat industry faces the worst **crisis** in its history, wheat farmers will once again turn to a Labor government to rescue them from the disastrous position in which they now find themselves after 20 years of Liberal-Country Party bungling.

* It is our fortune at this moment of **crisis** to have all the physical resources that are needed to create  a  new world of opportunity, lt is our tragedy that we may lack the vision and the will.

* But if much foreign capital had not been invested in this country during the last five or six years, and if we had not been able to raise loans in the United States of America, Switzerland and England, this Government would have been faced with a **crisis** or would have been bankrupt long ago.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition justified his case with phrases such as 'a **crisis** in education'.

* ls there a **crisis** in our schools?

* There has not been a teaching **crisis**.

* The **crisis** in education referred to by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition patently does not exist.

* While the honorable member for Barton and his colleagues have been calling for the discussion of matters of urgency, crying **crisis**, and howling calamity generally, in the 10 years that I have been in this Parliament we have seen the most spectacular improvement in educational services in the nation's history.

* While honorable members opposite have been howling **crisis** our educational system has been progressively improving as fast, if not faster than that of any other country in the world.

* The **crisis** in education, they say, arises from the Commonwealth's rejection of one of the recommendations of the Martin Committee - that relating to teacher training.

* Yet Opposition members seriously try to suggest that the inability of the Commonwealth to contribute 10 million for teacher training over four years has of itself created a **crisis** in the Australian education system.

* Just how much sincerity can we attach to their case when they howl " Crisis " on such an unsubstantial point?

* It is also my purpose to suggest that a proposal raised as a matter of public importance which has as its central thesis that there is a **crisis** in Australian education because the Commonwealth does not find 10 million over four years for teacher training - a proposal moreover raised by a Party whose policy on education is confined to only three-quarters of Australia's children - is not worthy of the consideration of the Parliament.

* It has dealt with every **crisis** that has arisen, even the **crisis** of a great civil war, and it has emerged successful.

* The Government, in this Budget, makes no attempt to end or mend the housing **crisis** which exists in Australia to-day.

* Despite the fact that there is a **crisis** in the farming industries throughout Australia, those who represent in this Parliament - or who are supposed to represent - farming interests give very little support to honorable members on this side of the chamber who seek assistance for the farmers in their plight.

* 1 submit that the responsibility for the **crisis** in primary industries in Australia can be laid at the door of this Government.

* We have now reached the condition that applied during the **crisis** of a past depression when it was said that if a man was unemployed it was largely his own fault.

* If the Cuban **crisis** has now become a matter of history, as some people affect to consider it has, then this appears to be the proper time at which to examine the lessons to be learned from that **crisis**.

* By and large, however, there is no such unrest in Australia although recently an incident occurred in which the sheer stupidity of the Queensland police produced a student **crisis**, although of smaller dimension than most of the recent crises involving students.

* There must be an end to this policy of drifting from **crisis** to **crisis** and dealing with each one hour by hour, as  it  arises.

* Sir Frederick  further revealed that Australia was certainly not ready in the Prime Minister's **crisis** year of 1953.

* None knows better than he how and when to create an atmosphere of **crisis**.

* Let me make this point, which I will repeat again and again until it is fixed indelibly in the minds of the Australian people: If the Prime Minister's words mean anything, they mean that he believes that a **crisis** exists now, not that it will exist in the future.

* The Prime Minister is obliged to sustain the **crisis** atmosphere he tried to manufacture on Tuesday night last for another three weeks - the three weeks to 5th December.

* But the defence proposals which he claims to justify, by stating that a **crisis** exists now, will not take physical shape for another three years.

* Is there a plan - or even a thought - for a greater Australia behind the **crisis** policy?

* But the people have a right to know whether the Government has a plan to overcome the present **crisis** and the unemployed have a right to know when they are going to share in the prosperity unlimited in this Australia unlimited.

* The letter is dated 4th May, 1961, and is in these terms - 
Does the Prime Minis.ter consider the **crisis** in Vietnam to be a threat to Australia's security?

* But I desire to make my contribution this afternoon on the present **crisis** that exists between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

* It was a time of **crisis**.

* I particularly raised the Czechoslovakian **crisis** on every possible occasion.

* 1 asked the people wherever I went whether they thought the Czechoslovakian **crisis** would result in military intervention.

* I believe that in the past too many situations have been allowed to reach **crisis** point before action has been taken.

* 1 1 fails to recognise the serious **crisis** in education.

* Because of this peculiar un-Australian philosophy of the Labor Party, this year is a **crisis** year for Australia in foreign affairs.

* It is a **crisis** of confidence - a **crisis** that will test our courage and our conviction.

* The danger of a world food **crisis** surely warrants us proceeding with the Ord River project.

* I invite attention to the headline " World food **crisis** may be closer ", which appeared in the " Sydney Morning Herald " on 22nd August last.

* We had none of this equipment in the last war, but in the kind of war in which we would move if there were a **crisis** we would need a most extraordinary array of heavy engineering equipment.

* I think these Bills represent a **crisis** in university finance.

* There has been a change in the views of the Australian community concerning the desirability of university education and tertiary education, but underlying this **crisis** are other factors.

* I believe that this means there is a real **crisis** in education.

* Having achieved their immediate objective, the government would be wise to recognize the existence of a balance of payments **crisis**, and introduce suitable measures to curb imports without further delay.

* Honorable members talk about a **crisis** in education.

* The **crisis** is far greater in the independent schools than any **crisis** that one could imagine in the State schools.

* A short time ago Lord Casey suggested that if the Commonwealth means anything at all it means that the Commonwealth countries should come to one another's aid in times of **crisis**.

* Here is a **crisis** for the people of India.

* What does Australia intend to do about that **crisis**?

* Recently in Moscow, U Thant, the Secretary General of the United Nations, went on record as saying that a **crisis** had developed in this matter of finance and that all countries would have to be prepared to review their efforts to finance the organisation's obligations.

* The State Government sought Commonwealth financial assistance after advising that a serious **crisis** existed because transport services were not adequate to transport an abnormal quantity of lambs from King Island to the mainland market.

* In these circumstances, the Government agreed to subsidize the air freight of lamb carcasses during the **crisis** at a rate not exceeding threepence per pound on a series of special flights.

* The subsidy was paid on the strict understanding that it would apply only during the **crisis** and that steps would be taken to avoid similar crises in the future.

* The Prime Minister did not imagine, as he made his remarks at Port Lincoln in May 1963, that we would have an economic **crisis** over foreign investment so soon.

* Why has the present **crisis** come about?

* We know that it has arisen because the United States of America has had a balance of trade **crisis** and is determined that more and more of the profits of American investment overseas shall be returned to that country.

* If it is good enough for the wheat industry, the dried vine fruits industry and the dairy industry to receive grants from the Commonwealth then it is good enough for the sugar industry to receive grants, particularly at a time of **crisis** such as it is facing now.

* Has this discontent reached **crisis** proportions, as claimed by one newspaper?

* We all remember how, in 1940, in a **crisis**,  Sir Winston  Churchill offered France union with Britain - a political union even going beyond what is predicated in the Common Market.

* But I would suggest to the House that the **crisis** of survival in which we stand to-day is at least as bad as the **crisis** of survival which Britain faced in 1940.

* The outcome of the **crisis** there will have profound implications reaching far beyond Asia.

* I venture to say that if there were a **crisis** or a catastrophe such as an earthquake or a flood in India or Chile, it would not be unlikely that this Government would give quite large sums of money for relief to those countries.

* Yet here, right now, in our very midst, we have a **crisis** - a national **crisis** - and so far we have not been able to see our way clear to giving the States some assistance to meet it.

* The Leader of the Opposition says the Budget fails to recognise the serious **crisis** in education.

* Over the past year, we have all heard a great deal about the **crisis** in education, about the shortage of teachers, the overcrowded classrooms and so on.

* So if we have a **crisis** today, presumably there was just as great a **crisis** then.

* There the position under the vigorous and progressive government led by  Sir Henry  Bolte is not one of **crisis** but of very striking progress.

* Whilst no-one would claim that everything on the education front is so good that it could not be improved - and greatly improved, I will concede - there is far from a condition of **crisis** in Victoria.

* The honorable member for Lalor also criticised the Minister for Trade for what he believed was his attitude in connection with the Suez **crisis**.

* To the north of us lay the colonial empires controlled by England, Holland and France, We knew that in any foreseeable situation or **crisis** these countries would be our allies.

* The newspapers are not likely to be interested in Australia in a worthwhile way until after we are involved in a **crisis**.

* We want United States attitudes formed before we are in a **crisis** so that when a **crisis** does come the reaction of the United States will be automatically our way.

* - I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the most unfortunate but nevertheless very disturbed and delicate situation which still exists in Djakarta, and of the challenge in the speech made yesterday by Indonesia's delegate to the United Nations, does the Government consider it wise for the families of Australian diplomats to return to Indonesia this week7 In times of emergency or **crisis**, does not the presence of dependants seriously affect the efficiency of those who have to make decisions, as happened in Singapore in 1941?

* The **crisis**, impending or actual, which requires you to expand the Army is the same kind of **crisis** as that which makes it imperative for you to maintain the integrity of your operational forces.

* It is of no use to give us this soft soap about having the Citizen Military Forces and so forth to draw from in time of **crisis**.

* In the kind of **crisis** I have mentioned you just would not have trained and organised manpower available.

* The Leader of the Opposition claimed in his amendment that the Budget fails to recognise the serious **crisis** in education.

* It would seem that the Government's policy is to neglect these matters until a **crisis** is upon us; and then, of course, it would be too late.

* France went through a **crisis** of this sort for about fourteen years and almost reached the verge of revolution.

* Let us go back to the first **crisis** that faced the Menzies-Fadden Government in 1950.

* We reached another **crisis** in 1952.

* In 1952, we had a **crisis** and the Government introduced what has been called the horror Budget.

* In 1954, we had the beginning of the **crisis** for 1956.

* Potatoes and timber are the two products which cause ur greatest shipping problems but in time of **crisis** we should get the ships to move them.

* Why can it not make a loss occasionally to help Tasmania out of its timber **crisis**?

* Every Minister in the Cabinet should be on the spot where a **crisis** occurs.

* Some time later Butler admitted in a confidential "Personal Letter" to his
              supporters: "Possibly our greatest success in the field of special campaigning
              over the last twelve months, was our work on the Middle East **crisis**.

* We demonstrated
              here once again that a small body of dedicated men, who know what to do and how to do
              it, can have a decisive impact in a **crisis** .

* We should remember that other **crisis** spots still exist.

* But, more than this, 1 feel we should have refused to trade with these countries while this **crisis** exists.

* It is useless Australians professing to be supporting the Czechoslovakians in this **crisis** without being willing to make some sacrifice to give effect to our impassioned, sincere protests.

* Another matter in relation to this Fund that ought to be mentioned and which is appropriate to the present **crisis** relating to the Deutsche mark- 
It is a **crisis**, exacerbating the problems with the French franc.

* We are at liberty to ask ourselves whether we waited too long to become aware of the **crisis** with the Deutsche mark.

* One would hope that Australia will request that in any modification of the Articles of the Fund the scarce currency clause will be modified and arrangements will be made to have a contribution from the appropriate countries before we come to the kind of **crisis** that we have at the present time.

* The second recent event of importance is the financial **crisis** through which the United Kingdom has been passing, and which has possibly spurred her to seek entry into the European Economic Community, of which I will say something more later.

* More recently, the Berlin **crisis** and the tension that has developed as a result of it, have become, possibly, the greatest danger and the greatest potential cause of a world explosion.

* The Minister said that this is a manufactured **crisis** and that there has been spectacular improvement in education.

* In the field of planning, all the evidence shows that from about 1971 there will be a greater **crisis**, if one can use that word.

* Whether one can use the word " **crisis** " when a condition continues for generation after generation, is perhaps a question of semantics.

* The history of the Labour Party shows that it has always acknowledged, accepted and discharged, in a responsible manner, its duties to this country in a time of **crisis**.

* Labour has acted responsibly when no **crisis** has existed.

* Throughout the **crisis** between Israel and her Arab neighbours the United Nations manifested a characteristic which was very clear, lt was this: So long as the veto was exercised constantly by the Soviet Union, the United Nations was directed on one course.

* If it is necessary for us to be dumb when Cairo Radio makes its demands for the extermination of men, women and children in Israel, and we pretend that this is not a danger to peace, although it built up finally to a **crisis**, why worry to pretend that we have any moral basis in our action in other situations in the world?

* But it was the same Government which imposed import controls - this private enterprise Government which resorts always to controls when its lack of planning results in a **crisis**.

* Mention of the United Nations now brings me to the second area that I wish to cover very briefly, and that is the involvement of the United Nations in the recent **crisis** in the Middle East.

* This **crisis** was a useful reminder to us and to all of the other peoples of the world of the capacity and ability of the United Nations and also, I think, its limitations.

* The Labor Party sees Australia as playing a greater role in support of the United Nations because obviously - and the Middle East **crisis** underlines this situation again - there are limitations to the field within which the great powers can operate.

* The truth is that there is a **crisis** in education.

* Yet, only a week or two ago, when this Opposition and the six State Premiers of Australia pleaded with the Government to make urgently needed financial grants to state education systems in order to meet the **crisis** not only in primary and secondary education but also in the technical education systems - something that is much more relevant to our discussion tonight - the plea was rejected.

* But the point is that no-one who knows the kind of **crisis** situation that now exists and which would continue to exist without this Bill becoming an Act in the next calendar year could possibly responsibly propose such an amendment.

* Let us turn for a moment to the other **crisis** which exists in spite of the great advances that have been made.

* Honourable members will recall the Berlin **crisis** ten or fifteen years ago and the nostrums that were proposed by the former Prime Minister and the then Minister for External Affairs.

* The fourth matter I wish to mention concerns the **crisis** in Sabah and Sarawak during the 1963 and 1964 elections.

* The sugar industry in Australia is facing a financial **crisis**.

* The life companies, which had played a major role as investors in United States Government securities at a time of national **crisis**, gradually shifted their investment emphasis to provide capital for business and industrial growth, home-building and community development.

* That newspaper was quite dramatic about the effect of the short term **crisis**.

* As I have said, there can be no doubt that a short term **crisis** exists.

* It is clearly recognised in other countries that reliance on monetary policy to meet a short term **crisis** of this sort will not necessarily restrict expenditure in places where ft is perhaps desirable to restrict it.

* There is no indication that the Government is going to meet the short term **crisis** any better than it has met other crises in the past.

* So much for the short term **crisis** that undoubtedly exists.

* I think it is the responsibility of this Parliament to emphasise the existence of the short term problem and to require the Government to give some indication, at any rate, that it is prepared to deal with the **crisis**.

* But we have this short term **crisis**, with little prospect of a positive policy beneficial to the economy emerging, because the long term **crisis** has not been adequately dealt with.

* Indeed, I would go further and say that only the gravest of national dangers - danger amounting almost to a **crisis** - would justify any government in calling people up to fight overseas against their will.

* I say that the only military reason could be a grave national danger, amounting to a **crisis**.

* I thought that we might have heard some high comment on the international situation, the **crisis** in unemployment, or the **crisis** in trade.

* We have reached **crisis** point.

* At the time of the Cuban **crisis**  President  Kennedy made a statement which I think summed up and crystallised a situation very similar to that which exists today.

* Then, of course, in December of 1960 the Soviet Union - not Red China - began an airlift of military equipment and North Vietnamese to aid the pro-Communist forces in Laos, thus initiating the **crisis** with which we are still faced today.

* The alternative is the same as that which was available in a comparable situation at the time of the **crisis** in Korea and more recently in Cuba, where very swift action was taken.

* In these three continental areas of Asia; Africa and Latin America the forces of the Communists have confronted the free world with **crisis** after **crisis** in such rapid succession that these events seem to blur in the minds of the people, and certainly they must be blurred in the eyes of members of the Opposition in the light of the proposition which has been put forward tonight.

* On every occasion when Australia has been faced with a **crisis**, the Australian Labour Party has been called to office.

* In August 1962, if the former Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, was justified in giving to the House the impression, as he did, that we were facing a serious **crisis**, has there been any change of events in Europe in the last four and a half years to justify the much milder attitude of the Prime Minister  (Mr Harold Holt)  today?

* In 1962 we faced this great **crisis** in the House.

* The British people have to thank this master of modernisation, this prophet of purpose, for crippling taxation, plus a wage freeze, plus rising prices, plus a derisory rise in production, plus a chronic balance of payments **crisis**.

* The Australian Labour Party has always regarded the aid that has been given, whether direct or indirect, as merited, because we have believed that it has been given in order to relieve a **crisis** in Australian education.

* We still believe that aid given to relieve a **crisis** in Australian education is aid that should rightly be given by the Commonwealth and by the States.

* Honorable members have mentioned the areas of **crisis** in the community.

* It is the custom of people from the opposite side of politics, including Ministers of the Crown in this Parliament and Ministers in State Parliaments, to say that there is no **crisis** in education.

* I suppose there is no **crisis** if you use the word in the ordinary semantic sense of something which has bubbled up now and will be gone in a moment, but this is a continuing thing and for the individuals involved the position is indeed critical.

* Later in what I have to say tonight I want to refer to the statement made by the honorable member for Yarra  (Dr. J. F. Cairns)  when he spoke about the attack made by the North Vietnamese on the United States naval force in the Gulf of Tonkin and said that the United States could not claim that it was being attacked in the present Vietnamese **crisis**.

* Malaya went through a period of desperate **crisis**, with internal insurrection and continued subversion.

* A near **crisis** has now arisen in Vietnam, where the same forces are preventing the South Vietnamese Government from proceeding to accomplish its legitimate purposes.

* In both these areas we are reaching a point which might be described as a **crisis**.

* Roads and water in my State of Victoria are perilously close to a state of **crisis**.

* He asserted that I had said that the United States could not claim that it was being attacked in the present Vietnam **crisis**.

* I find that the " Sydney Morning Herald " published a statement in the exact words quoted by the Minister as follows - 
The United States could not claim that it was being attacked in the present Vietnamese **crisis**.

* The significant words inserted by the ** Sydney Morning Herald " - " In the pre sent Vietnamese **crisis** " - were left out of the " Age " report for the simple reason that they were not used.

* Not so many years ago Australia was the first country to declare itself by the side of the United States in the **crisis** in Korea.

* What is the fundamental difference between the course we are now following and the course we followed in the **crisis** of South Korea in July 1950?

* The presence of our forces in Vietnam will only aggravate an already delicate international **crisis**.

* I desire now to deal with the **crisis** which exists in the home-building and allied industries.

* Can honourable members imagine anything worse in precipitating a **crisis** in that family?

* We can imagine the **crisis** that some people would be thrown into as a result of this cut because of their indebtedness or some other family reasons or because of habits of expenditure.

* I submit that the people of Australia know very well that there is a **crisis** in education; that the people who should be carrying the responsibility are those who hold the purse strings; and that the States no longer have this power.

* The first point was that the **crisis** is the greatest in the primary school area.

* This indicates that there is no housing **crisis** for the wealthy.

* I turn now to page 1 9 of the report, where the Committee says that there will be a **crisis** - the Committee calls it a period of extreme emergency - in the provision of telephone services for "both subscribers and subscriber trunk dialling in the northern Sydney area between 1970 and some time late in 1971.

* I have heard it said unworthily in this debate by several honorable members on the Government side that the Labour Party would like to see unemployment grow out of the existing **crisis**.

* But worst of all is this Government's inactivity in the credit **crisis** situation.

* It is my responsibility, particularly in times of **crisis** such as we have now, to keep their views in mind and to place them before the people in authority.

* Primary production is rapidly approaching a **crisis**.

* Issues such as the Middle East **crisis** were debated fully and bitterly.

* I am very honoured indeed to report to the House that the Australian delegation produced the solution to this **crisis** which faced the InterParliamentary Union.

* I remind the Committee of the time when  Sir Robert  Menzies, as he now is, returned from Egypt after his conference with  Colonel Nasser  during the Suez **crisis**.

* He ensured that whatever action was practicable and was possible was taken, first of all, to get loan moneys for the sugar industry during the period of **crisis** and, secondly, that we did not entertain for one moment any wildcat scheme of cutting down cane acreage or of imposing any restrictions en the growers, which would have achieved nothing and which would have placed them in a position today where the benefits of this new international Agreement may not have been as useful to the Australian industry as they will prove to be.

* Without this assistance many farmers would not have survived the recent **crisis** in the industry.

* For evidence of this one has only to look at his performances at the time of the Suez **crisis**, in the United Nations last, year and at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference when the **crisis** arose over the South African policy of apartheid.

* The Government could impose import restrictions gradually, increasing them in accordance with the degree of **crisis** with which it was confronted.

* Plastic dolls, good enough for any Australian children, can be made in Australia - particularly in a time of economic **crisis** - and they give just as much amusement.

* If circumstances should develop which would warrant the recalling of the Parliament because of any **crisis** in international affairs, neither I, as Acting Prime Minister, nor the Prime Minister, on his return in a few weeks' time, would hesitate to call the House together.

* I was rather dismayed to hear Government back-benchers referring to the Minister for Trade  (Mr. McEwen)  as one who fights out a **crisis**, who sees it through, and who faces up to a situation with calmness.

* per lb., the **crisis** is one of markets rather than one of prices.

* The point we on this side of the chamber have been considering in our committee discussions is whether we have a **crisis** of markets rather than a **crisis** of prices.

* Will he give his urgent attention to the serious **crisis** in the Australian tanning industry arising from the acute shortage of hides?

* By this winter, the raw total may be as high as 3%, the highest rate of unemployment, barring only that in the 1947 fuel **crisis**, that postwar Britain has seen.

* The **crisis** in the Australian book manufacturing industry exploded into the public gaze exactly 12 months ago today.

* Up to the time of the **crisis** when the Australian book manufacturing industry was on the verge of collapse the story of the industry is briefly this: The low cost competition from Hong Kong, Japan and Formosa was so keen that the Asian countries were undercutting Australian book companies by 50%.

* This means that we are at a stage where we are producing so much canned fruit that we cannot sell it overseas, making Government action to meet this impending **crisis** an urgent need for the next summer season.

* We must therefore play our part because the **crisis** in Vietnam is a threat to our well being.

* May I remind him also that in the gravest **crisis** that Australia has ever had to face - in World War II - it was a Labour Government to which this nation turned to guide it through the darkest days of our history.

* A defence and foreign affairs **crisis** has been contrived before each election as a sure election winner.

* The Australian Country Party has published a very good booklet entitled " The Crisis in Farm Costs and Income ".

* The present **crisis** was set in train by a Soviet memorandum delivered to United States officials in Vienna at the time  of  President  Kennedy's meeting there with  Mr. Khrushchev,  on 3rd and 4th.

* The possibility of the United Nations playing a useful role in the present **crisis** can therefore not be excluded.

* We will no doubt be told that the decision to explode these further bombs is due to the tension resulting from the Berlin **crisis**.

* But, as I have pointed out earlier in this statement, this is a **crisis** manufactured by the Soviet itself.

* This **crisis** will arrive whether the United Kingdom joins the Common Market or not.

* The roots of the present **crisis** lie in the events of 18th February 1948 and 10th March 1948.

* In the 1948 **crisis**, a **crisis** artificially and deliberately created, the Communists replied to Benes professing acceptance of Parliament, which institution is no part of the Communist creed, and praising Benes.

* The **crisis** that began in 1948 shows that Czech aspirations to freedom have not died and will not die.

* I, for one, do not think that there will be any **crisis** involving Australia's defence in the next few years; but this is a matter of chance  and opinion.

* This a good thing; it is a most immediate thing to do and the Government has done it The second thing is one which, again, is a good thing to do, although it is an unpleasant thing to do, and that is to prepare a rationing scheme so that in case of **crisis** or emergency our oil supplies can go further.

* They were told there was an employment **crisis** when they were finding it hard to get a plumber, an electrician, a painter, a shearer or a farmhand.

* They were telling the Australian people that there was a housing **crisis**, although, during the term of office of this Government, more than 1,000,000 new homes have been constructed and the young people now have a better prospect of getting finance and getting homes in the early stages of married life than had any generation in the history of the English-speaking world before them.

* .- The House will  be  aware that in recent  weeks  a serious **crisis** has occurred in the disposal of tobacco leaf in Australia, and that this is having very adverse effects on many small growers in Victoria, which will also extend, in the next few weeks, to Western Australia.

* What proposals have been put by those people and what does the Government propose to do to assist tobacco-growers who have suffered this **crisis** in recent months?

* It must be realized that when this country has been faced with a period of **crisis**, in every instance the people have turned to Labour.

* No doubt, if a **crisis** occurred to-morrow, they would again turn to Labour.

* The wheat industry faces **crisis** and chaos.

* Without this, the possibility of black marketing is not eliminated, and with the sort of **crisis** facing the wheat industry, and with the temptation on the farmer to sell what the Wheat Board will not take, there will not be enough Commonwealth police in the nation to police the two-price system.

* The world at the moment is alerted by the Cuban **crisis**, and I doubt whether there will be another time when more people in Australia will be listening to a debate on the estimates for the Department of Defence.

* People are listening because of the international **crisis**, and they are listening also to hear where the Australian Labour Party really stands on the question of defence.

* Although there has been talk about the Labour Party taking the reins of office in this country during the last war, I do not believe it will ever do so again in a time of **crisis**.

* They know that, while there is a world **crisis**, the popular thing is to talk about defence.

* But, as soon as the **crisis** fades away, all that honorable members opposite can say is that we need more money for social services and that we should cut down on defence expenditure.

* No one would imagine that a **crisis** existed in Australia to-day.

* He is able to make very pleasant sounding speeches but does nothing to examine the **crisis** which now is confronting this nation, or to present any worthwhile programme to correct it 
Let me turn now to the immigration cut.

* This shows that the Government realizes that the economic **crisis** will continue, that it will not be of short duration at all.

* He said that in a time of **crisis** the wheat farmers turn to Labor.

* He made the outrageous statement that the 
If there is a **crisis** regarding world marketing of wheat, what do I do?

* The spokesman for the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Dawson, says that the price has been set too high and the **crisis** was created by a swing from wool, which is unprofitable, to wheat, which is profitable.

* The first is that there are very serious deficiencies - in fact a **crisis** - in many parts of the system of education, research and science.

* Few yet realise the full implications of the financial **crisis** into which universities have been plunged for the next three years.

* The universities, and more particularly the longer established ones, are going through a period of financial **crisis**', he said.

* No man whom we might have known and no man of whom we might have read has ever blazed with a more indomitable character than did Churchill, a magnificent statesman and a magnificent orator who, as the Prime Minister has said, with the aid of the medium of broadcasting carried his word of encouragement and hope, and sometimes of denunciation, to the whole world and made his tremendous impact upon the world in the period of greatest **crisis**.

* As we know, he was called by his Parliament - and indeed by his nation - to the leadership of his country in its greatest hour of **crisis**.

* Anything Australia could do in the present **crisis** would only be delaying the final death agony of the Dutch Empire.

* He knows that we would not apply a provision like this unless there is danger or **crisis**.

* Let us make no mistake about this:: 
For a country or an enemy to be proclaimed, nobody would suggest that we had not reached something like a **crisis**.

* Indeed, I would say that any proclamation such as this, if a **crisis** had not occurred, would provoke a **crisis**.

* Indeed this **crisis** and the brief war in the Middle East have had serious worldwide effects.

* I think that one thing has come out of the Cuban **crisis** - something that has been maintained since 1945 when the first atomic bomb was exploded over Japan.

* What has happened, I believe, particularly in view of the Cuban **crisis**, is that the nuclear weapon has been demonstrated as a deterrent to war.

* I think it has been proved during the Cuban **crisis** that, to-day, countries are in possession of a deterrent weapon.

* I think that honorable members should study these papers if they want to be well informed on the situation which led to the Cuban **crisis** and the situation afterwards.

* On that occasion, when the Cuban **crisis** had occurred and action was about to be taken, my mind went back to 2nd September, 1939, when in Australia we heard a broadcast from London by the then Prime Minister of Great Britain on the **crisis** that had occurred in Europe.

* According to the report of his speech on page 4 of the papers to which I have referred, he said - 
The Cuban **crisis** has been resolved and the  President  of the United States has been seen as a spokesman for the free world.

* there is no longer a military **crisis** over Cuba and we can look at this matter for what we can learn for the future, not only in Cuba but in similar places around the world, of which there are all too many.

* As appears at page 5 of the first volume of documents on the Cuban **crisis**, President Kennedy said - 

 Mr Whitlam claimed yesterday that the **crisis** over the Fill resulted from over-hasty action by the Menzies Government in 1963.

* I suggest it is quite wrong to try to stampede the people into thinking that there is a **crisis** in education or that there should be the kind of inquiry that has been suggested by Opposition members.

* However, the **crisis** exists.

* Professor Messell went on record recently as claiming that the **crisis** has existed for six years.

* This is the **crisis** situation in our schools, and it is passing into tertiary education.

* The world is now moving into a sustained famine **crisis** of a severity unprecedented in history.

* If those are our motives, we do not even begin to meet the **crisis**, lt will take the best of our minds, capital on a scale of that being spent on the Vietnam war and care equivalent to military planning to avert famine.

* I recall that on 9th August 1962 he created in the House an atmosphere of **crisis**.

* Perhaps the Government takes a different view about the degree of **crisis** involved now compared to the position in 1962.

* Honorable members opposite talk about a **crisis** in education.

* I just do not believe there is a **crisis**.

* Group of 10 meets on Europe's money **crisis**.

* The article is entitled: Background to the Gold Crisis', lt delineates some of the problems that really face the western world and I suppose the world as a whole.

* The article, which was written in April 1968, states: 
The gold **crisis** tore a gaping hole in the world's monetary system, which has been patched up for the moment, lt has also brought to the surface all the fundamental questions that have been tossed around for years during the interminable debate on international monetary reform.

* Should America and Britain be blamed for precipitating the **crisis** by .their failure to bring their payments into balance?

* How much does it matter anyway - is this really another 1931 or just a minor **crisis**?

* Has the Minister for Civil Aviation seen a magnificent article published in the Melbourne 'Age' on Monday, 21st August, under the heading 'Lord Howe Island - Paradise of Privacy - But the Crisis Lies Ahead', which describes the unspoiled beauty and attraction of Lord Howe Island and then warns that the island will be almost inaccessible after 1970 because of the cancellation of the flying boat service to the island?

* I say to the Leader of the Opposition that his allegation that an inflation **crisis** exists in this country is completely unwarranted; it is without foundation.

* On this occasion we have a difficulty, but we have not a **crisis**.

* The grave **crisis** which confronts education in Australia extends through all levels of education.

* These figures mean that if nothing is done to provide additional education resources now we will be faced with another **crisis** of numbers within five years, due to recent rises in the birth-rate and the increasing tendency of children to stay longer at school.

* an interim emergency grant be made to the States to meet the present **crisis** in education; and 
The long term effect of the embargo on trade with Victoria is not going to fall on New South Wales.

* New South Wales is facing its **crisis** today.

* This is an important industry and it is facing a **crisis**.

* We know that this **crisis** has been coming to a head for some time, but it has been aggravated by the gaoling of  Mr Clarrie  O'Shea, the Victoria secretary of the Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association.

* If we faced a real **crisis** tomorrow, we could not defend our own shores.

* Gone are the days when we could go to war today and wait for six months before being called on te provide any fighting force or any defence equipment to meet the **crisis** when it arose.

* There is a **crisis** in education, a **crisis** at the very time in history when education of all kinds is being increasingly recognized as the key to economic progress and at a time when a great tide of young people is becoming available for school and later training.

* In the next few years Australia will be faced with a **crisis** in relation to the housing of young married couples.

* Will the Minister amplify the widely publicised statements made by the Attorney-General to the meeting and say what action the Commonwealth intends to take to assist government and non-government schools to meet the **crisis** in education?

* On 30th April last the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  revealed to the Parliament that the Australian wheat industry was facing an economic **crisis**.

* Since 30th April the Government has refused to allow the Parliament to debate the wheat **crisis** indicated by the Minister for Primary Industry in his statement on 30th April.

* If there is one place where a wheat **crisis** in Australia should have been debated it was this national Parliament.

* On 22nd May 1 was forced to use the debate on the Appropriation Bill as the only means we had of raising the problem of the wheat **crisis** and advancing the Opposition's views on this matter.

* When the Parliament resumed in August the wheat situation had deteriorated alarmingly both domestically and overseas, and in view of the great importance of wheat to Australia a debate on the wheat **crisis** should have been facilitated without further delay.

* Still the Government refused to initiate any debate on the wheat **crisis**.

* Incredible as it may seem, but nevertheless true, the Leader of the Australian Country Party has not made one ministerial statement in this Parliament this year on the wheat **crisis** or on the International Grains Arrangment so that a debate could be facilitated.

* The Government's overall approach to the wheat **crisis**, as evidenced by its refusal to allow a debate on this most important and explosive issue in the Parliament, is a national disgrace.

* The Government has become so power drunk that it believes it is electorally invincible, even to the degree that it can treat the wheat **crisis** and the problems of the wheat grower with detached indifference.

* The Government, by its reluctance to assist in the provision of additional storages and by its failure to assert initiative in this matter, is taking the view that the industry is to blame for the mess today and that it is up to the industry to salvage the wreck that could follow this mounting **crisis**.

* The wheat growers have responded so magnificently and with such enthusiasm that tremendous increases in production have been generated, but as soon as the **crisis** of over-production became evident the Government not only attempted to pass the buck but refused to take the initiative, claiming that the industry must solve its own problems.

* The wheat **crisis** has occurred because farmers have been encouraged to grow wheat at relatively high prices compared with other forms of alternative land use.

* But the Government apparently remained oblivious to the impending **crisis**.

* This expensive **crisis** demands that the national Government take the initiative to solve the greatest single **crisis** in Australian agriculture since the depression days of at least 40 years ago.

* The Labour Party forged the Australian-American alliance at a time when the present Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies)  had demonstrated his complete incapacity to lead the nation in the deepest **crisis** in its history.

* I now turn to the Minister's statement on the South Vietnam **crisis** which the House is to note.

* The Government has done nothing to awaken the Australian people to the realities of the situation in Vietnam, nothing to enlighten them as to our true role in Vietnam and nothing to prepare them to understand the nature, much less the origins, of the present **crisis**.

* This is precisely what President Johnson did, in his words, " immediately and urgently " when the Gulf of Tonkin **crisis** arose.

* So we will face an even greater **crisis** in our trade payments position.

* He has taken no action in the past twelve years, and now he finds himself in a **crisis**, and the Government has panicked over Britain's proposed entry into the European Economic Community.

* The Australian sugar industry is facing a great **crisis**.

* Parliament is being asked to approve this important development in the fight to save the industry at a time of real **crisis**- a fight in which the Government has already committed $3Sm.

* This is the first of the Treasurer's Budgets which has not been presented in an atmosphere of **crisis**, either incipient, actual or receding.

* The full year's increased revenue of 87 million exceeds that of the little Budget of March 1956, which produced an increase of 81 million, and this is more than twice the total increase the Treasurer deemed necessary at the height of the 1960 **crisis**.

* .- Mr. Deputy Speaker, I support the amendment which was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell)  and which condemns the Budget and highlights the Government's failure to make adequate adjustments of social service benefits and to recognise the serious **crisis** that exists in education today.

* which was published as recently as July of this year, warned - 
The **crisis** in education continues, as indicated by the concern expressed by the teachers' federations in the various States and the vast amount of publicity given to this fact.

* The additional amount of $30 million provided in the Budget will not meet this **crisis**.

* But since the advent of this new Department and the sharpening of the interest of honorable members in these matters by the honorable member for Wakefield  (Mr. Kelly),  together with the **crisis** in tariffs which could be approaching, many more honorable members have been rising in their places to discuss these matters.

* Now we have come to a **crisis**.

* In the face of an educational **crisis**, a hospital finance **crisis** and lack of business confidence he could not afford to spend more money.

* When industries fail for economic reasons or because of mechanization, as has occurred in my electorate on the northern coalfields, I consider that the Minister failed in his duty to anticipate a **crisis** long before it arose.

* Even at the height of the Government-imposed **crisis** of 1952 there was no fall in savings bank deposits.

* Market, when he was assisted in respect of a visit to the United Kingdom, in the Suez **crisis** issue when he espoused the Nasser cause and, of course, at the social credit seminar in Melbourne.

* The Government has tried to meet the **crisis** with a policy of sales tax imposition.

* The great economic **crisis** in this country has related substantially to our overseas balances - to the great fall in exports and the great increase in imports.

* The Government has said: " We have to face up to this **crisis** in a scientific manner.

* So the main economic measure of the Government, in the face of this mounting **crisis**, is being abandoned.

* There are some associated economic measures, but the increase in sales tax was the salient point of the Government's programme to combat the **crisis**.

* This factor is obviously completely and inseparably associated with the import **crisis**.

* The stage of **crisis** in the economy should not have been allowed to develop.

* When, in the face of some national **crisis** or disturbance, their courage fails them, they can cast their minds back to the beginning of this nation.

* I do not suggest that there is any **crisis** yet, but action should be taken to avoid the occurrence of one at some time in the future.

* There is danger if we concentrate only on this fund, because it can be used to slur over the international adjustments that should take place and to allow unmade but necessary adjustments to accumulate until some kind of **crisis** occurs, as happened, for example, in 1929 when a financial **crisis** overtook the world economy.

* A Liberal Government would not do that even in a time of great **crisis**.

* Our geographical link with Asia means that every **crisis** in that area, particularly in South East Asia, brings a darkening cloud over Australia and causes people to think about our defence and our foreign affairs policy.

* This may well be a very dangerous period for Australia, because it is obviously the period in which the Malaysian **crisis** will be resolved ohe way or another.

* The first economic **crisis** struck the capitalist world in 182S, followed by others in 1836, 1847, 1857, 1873, 1890, 1900, 1907, 1920, 1929 and 1937.

* a day, and by ignoring the fact that the value of money has been destroyed by inflation, the Government is contributing to the hospital **crisis** that exists in this country.

* It does not overcome in any way the present **crisis** confronting the hospitals of Australia.

* The attitudes of the political defaulters in respect of peace-keeping operations have brought the organization into a state of acute financial **crisis**, and I can assure the honorable member that the Australian delegation at the present session of the General Assembly is instructed to work actively for a solution of this **crisis**.

* I believe, as, indeed, I think most honorable members will believe, that in this **crisis** of history some strong and effective and workable international organization is necessary.

* We know from past experience that in a period of **crisis** there would be the most complete and thorough consultation, with full consideration being given to Australia's views.

* We have no doubt that whatever we have to say in any situation of **crisis** will be listened to and given every consideration.

* The situation would be far worse if this issue were allowed to divide the nation's will in time of complete and actual **crisis**.

* If this issue is divisive and if we see opposite us a divider who was prepared to stab John Curtin in the back, in the person of the man who at present is in command of the Opposition, then it is important that we have these matters decided here and now, because the next **crisis** for Australia may not be as easily or pleasantly solved as the last one was.

* They tried to say that Australia was not in danger; that the war was no concern of Australians; that people were trying to blow the **crisis** up into something bigger than it was when Britain was falling, when bombs were raining on London, by saying that this did not matter to Australia; that this was not our concern.

* Indeed, it will be well if we can get this matter behind us now instead of allowing the Australian people to be divided, as the Opposition has shown it is capable of trying to divide them in moments of still greater **crisis**.

* Mr. Jago,  the New South Wales Minister for Health, speaking at Newcastle the other day, said that New South Wales is facing a **crisis** in its public hospitals.

* They bring matters relating to foreign policy up for discussion when there is some military **crisis**.

* But there is an enduring **crisis** here.

* Firmly believing that this nation now faces a **crisis** of survival, I address myself with such little skill and eloquence as I have to the hearts and minds of my fellow citizens, knowing that decisions are made both in the coolness of understanding and the warmth of emotion, particularly hopes and fears for ourselves and our children in the present and the future.

* There is at this moment a **crisis** in the Citizen Military Forces.

* If the Labor Party had been in power at that time, if a **crisis** had arisen when it was demanding joint control of the base and if the United States  President  had made a decision to defend the free world by the use of this base to send signals to submarines in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere,' the policy of the Labor Party would have necessitated that that decision be communicated to the Australian Labor government, and that government's permission would have had to be granted before that base could have been used to send a signal.

* Despite the self eulogy of the Minister in his second reading speech, the science blocks scheme has not provided the answer to the **crisis** in education in the areas of greatest need.

* The honourable member for Macarthur must never forget the occasion of the outbreak of World War II when the Japs were hammering at the doors of Australia, when bombs were falling on Darwin and the Liberal-Country Party Government leader at the time of this great **crisis** -  Mr Menzies  as he was then - walked out and left Australia to its fate.

* It is facing a **crisis** and this is through no fault of its own.

* Nevertheless, the **crisis** facing the industry is no fault of the growers.

* However, as I said, this **crisis** in various degrees is not confined to new growers.

* He did not express his current view on what the Minister for External Affairs referred to as the funds **crisis**.

* Mr. Green  is not pessimistic about Australia's ability to meet a **crisis** should it occur.

* The Opposition has moved this amendment because it believes that the people of this country will come to the country's support in a time of national **crisis**.

* No country in the world - and I want to drive this home - has ever survived continuous depreciation of its currency without serious economic repercussions and an ultimate **crisis**.

* When I refer to an ultimate **crisis**, I mean unemployment, business stagnation and hardship for everybody.

* However, if this narcotic inflationary spiral does not soon come to a halt, an ultimate **crisis** is inevitable and instead of the Prime Minister's name being rightly and gloriously linked with expansion and prosperity, it will be linked with misery and hardship.

* We on this side of the chamber believe that there is a **crisis** in education in Australia.

* There is ample evidence to show that there is a **crisis** in education.

* A **crisis** existed and we know of the drastic action that had to be taken.

* .- I wish to join in this important discussion on the Berlin **crisis** and atom bomb testing.

* It is sixteen years since the end of World War 
and this particular **crisis** is still with us.

* I also propose to speak to the estimates for the Department of Primary Industry, because primary industry today is facing a very real **crisis**.

* This **crisis** has been brought about by two factors - firstly, the cost-price squeeze in Australia and, secondly, the generally depressed commodity prices on world markets.

* It is useless for the Minister to put this proposal before the Parliament as the only escape from an irksome and arduous duty during a **crisis** that may arise at any time.

* The long shadows of conflict and **crisis** envelop us still, but we meet today in an atmosphere of rising hope, and at a moment of comparative calm.

* My presence here is not a sign of **crisis** but of confidence.

* Is there anybody in this House who will stand up now and say that the Prime Minister was right in 1956 over the Suez **crisis**?

* In considering this question, let us go back six years to the Suez **crisis**.

* 1 leave the House with this thought: These are the words with which sensitive people describe the **crisis** facing civilization.

* If we are to ensure that in the event of the **crisis** growing worse, .the Government can adopt even more sympathetic measures, then the circumstances exist for this to be done.

* The independent school system has reached a stage where it cannot guess about these matters, lt has to know because without any doubt whatsoever we have reached a certain **crisis** in education.

* But help must come because we have reached the stage, as I have said, of complete **crisis** in education.

* However, I think that the **crisis** is more real - if one can use that word - in the case of independent schools than perhaps in any other form of education.

* A **crisis** is approaching.

* The Victorian Secondary Teachers Association has produced a brochure entitled the " Crisis in the Staffing of Secondary Schools ".

* The honorable member pointed out quite truthfully and in a very reasoned and fair-minded way that Stanley Baldwin, although regarded by his followers in his day as a great political leader who had the capacity to win election after election on the issues that he was able to raise from time to time, now is one of the forgotten men in the political history of Great Britain because he failed his country in that he failed to prepare it for the **crisis** of the Second World War.

* I subscribe to the views expressed elsewhere recently that Australia should endeavour to help in the food **crisis** which now exists in Indonesia so that we may impress upon the Indonesian people that although we are alert and prepared to take a stand on the principles of democracy to which we adhere and although we will defend our territorial integrity and that of New Guinea, we nevertheless extend friendship to Indonesia.

* The first is a **crisis** of confidence in the alliances on which hitherto our security has been held to rest.

* It is possible for the Australian delegation at the United Nations to take action to urge the General Assembly of the United Nations to seek a settlement of the Nigerian **crisis** and to organise relief in the region called Biafra?

* Can be say whether the Cyprus **crisis** has had any effect upon the agreement on dried fruit marketing reached between Greece and Turkey last year?

* Is the **crisis** likely to affect Australian sales of dried fruit?

* Is the Seventh Menzies Government about to repeat the action of the First Menzies Government and leave this country without adequate defence in a time of **crisis**?

* Disaster was averted only by the prompt and decisive action taken by the United States in conjunction with its regional partners in the Organization of American States, by the use of the machinery of the United Nations, and by the restraint exercised by the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union in the course of negotiations for a peaceful issue to the **crisis**.

* Throughout the **crisis**, the  president  concentrated unwaveringly on the particular situation at issue and refused to be diverted; but he did so without excluding future negotiation of other issues.

* The United States, he made clear, was interested in reducing tensions and also halting the arms race, and was prepared to consider with its allies any useful proposals in regard to discussing a detente affecting Nato and the Warsaw Pact; but he added that a prolongation of the discussions concerning Cuba by linking these to the broader questions of European and world security would surely lead to intensification of the Cuban **crisis** and a grave risk to the peace of the world.

* Dr. Castro  replied that Cuba was willing to discuss its differences with the United States and to do everything in its power in co-operating with the United Nations in resolving the **crisis**.

* He reported on his return that he was satisfied that the weapon sites were being dismantled, and is reported to have said since then that the United States and U.S.S.R. had reached agreement on the principles for a peaceful settlement of the Cuban **crisis**.

* In this **crisis** the need for and the efficacy of regional defence have been demonstrated.

* There are grounds for hope that the immediate **crisis** over the introduction of Soviet missiles into Cuba will be resolved.

* If the economic and social progress we all desire is to be made, it will be necessary for all to resist such disruptive influences by continuing to show the firmness of purpose and restraint which was demonstrated in the **crisis** over Cuba.

* Meanwhile, we may hope that, if the Cuban **crisis** is successfully resolved - and as I have said we are not yet out of the wood - its resolution may give a new impetus to the search for solutions to these broader questions.

* Cuban Crisis- Ministerial Statement, 6th November, 1962 -  and move - 
Lurking behind this legislation is the deliberate, calculated political turmoil that can result only in social frictions and national fragmentation.

* In the last 25 years, the period between the fall of Singapore in 1942 and the announcement in the recent British White Paper of the phased withdrawal from Singapore, it has reached a **crisis** in its affairs.

* It was the only Government that was capable of facing up to the **crisis** in Australia.

* Australia has always turned to Labor in periods of **crisis**, and it will turn again just as surely as it did in those periods.

* The **crisis** in the Australian educational scene to-day is in secondary and tertiary education.

* There is a **crisis** over library facilities at the University of Sydney.

* When a **crisis** faced Australia following the outbreak of the war with Japan, the Labour Prime Minister of the day took action to meet the emergency.

* The honorable member began by saying that only the most urgent **crisis** would justify a nation's calling up men for national service training and sending them overseas.

* Indeed, it would do nothing until a **crisis** was upon us and had reached its most urgent stage.

* The Government, on the advice of its advisers, both diplomatic and military, has realised that there is a **crisis** in South East Asia; that there are threats to Australia in South East Asia and possibly threats to the peace of the world.

* Has the Government rejected import restrictions and currency devaluation as means by which the balance of payments **crisis** might be eased or corrected?

* In view of the continued rapid depletion of Australia's overseas financial reserves, will he state what further steps the Government intends to take to meet the **crisis** which will arise if our overseas funds completely disappear?

* It says that it will recommend to the banks that they lend money at  4i  per cent, interest to help farmers over their financial **crisis**.

* In view of the worsening wheat **crisis**, is the Government giving consideration to a revision of the Wheat Stabilisation Act to provide more flexible domestic price arrangements, to allow surplus wheat to be sold on the basis of feed grain prices and to stop black marketing?

* In 1955 in the first Formosa **crisis** our Prime Minister even went to Washington and said that there should be no war over Quemoy and Matsu.

* It meant an exchange of letters and notes through the agency of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and it was by that means that the **crisis** was solved.

* It is a matter of using the decisions of the days, weeks and months before to see that there is no fifteen-minutes **crisis** at all.

* Should capital inflow steady down, a severe **crisis** in the balance of payments could occur within the next 5 years.

* One never knew what **crisis** might develop.

* What effect will that have when the Government wants fuel carried around the coast in times of war or times of **crisis**; it will then be dependent on foreign ships and our shipbuilding capacity will have been destroyed.

* Where will that leave us in a **crisis**?

* Surely the Prime Minister is not adopting this attitude because he recalls that the former Prime Minister of India differed so greatly with him at the United Nations at the time of the Suez **crisis**?

* Cannot the Government realise that because of its negative, short term and complacent attitudes to the subject of water conservation, this country has become so dangerously unprepared to face a national drought and water shortage **crisis** that we could find ourselves in the greatest economic emergency of all times?

* The Government would most certainly welcome a change of view on the part of honorable gentlemen opposite to enable them to join with the Government in developing that degree of national unity which in times of **crisis** is so vital to the security of the nation.

* Mr. Calwell looks out of his window at Australia and sees nothing but galloping inflation, "so-called prosperity", an economic **crisis** and the shadows cif impending depression.

* So there cannot be any question about a mandate to use child endowment and not income tax deductions as a means of promoting recovery from the **crisis** that this Government has brought about.

* What we are faced with is a **crisis** resulting from an inequitable policy which favours queues of unemployed instead of queues of people seeking import licences, and this **crisis** is being surmounted by an inequitable means - income tax reductions.

* There was a time when only war or some comparable **crisis** could have caused expenditure of that order each year.

* There is a **crisis** today in Asia, Africa and South America.

* Mr Speaker,  as the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory is in hospital, on his behalf I present a Petition from certain citizens of the Australian Capital Territory showing that there is a **crisis** in education in Australia; that a transformation of the classroom situation is necessary, where children will have reasonable freedom to develop as selfreliant, independent individuals and where they can learn to function as members of a democratic community; that proper preparation for school and thorough guidance there, by qualified teachers, are crucial to a proper education for Australia's children; that the present rate of teacher training is far below the requirement determined by the Martin Report which shows that 75% additional teachers in government schools alone will be required by 1975 compared with those in service in 1963; that to obtain maximum benefit from the education system, preschool facilities should be available to all children; that insufficient State or Federal assistance has been made available to meet these requirements; that adequate finance to meet these requirements can only be provided by the Commonwealth Government; and that there is an urgent need for a national inquiry into all aspects of Australian education.

* The Opposition is trying to tell us that there is a **crisis** in education in Australia, that we are not putting enough of our resources into education, and that the situation is so serious that our future development as a nation is threatened.

* Let us use emotive words like " **crisis** ", which is used in this amendment, with the care with which they should be used.

* One of the principal justifications of the cry of **crisis** has been comparisons made of the proportion of national expenditure on education in various countries.

* Crisis, **crisis**! "

* Little is said,  Sir, by  the proponents of a **crisis** based on international comparisons, about the matters that I have just mentioned, although they all seem to me to be important in deciding whether a **crisis** exists.

* The Opposition, of course, in putting forward this amendment, is asking us to accept the proposition that a **crisis** exists.

* I am at a loss to understand how a situation which clearly can be described as a dramatic response to a challenge in the past and which opens up the prospect of continuing improvement in the future can be described as one of **crisis**.

* If there is a **crisis** in education it is in the universities, not in the schools.

* But there is not, nor do I believe that there will be, a **crisis**.

* Since I last spoke to the House on Tuesday, 11th April, new and important developments in the continuing **crisis** in Laos have occurred.

* I think he drew a rather horrible inference when he cited the charter of the bank and suggested that if Australia wanted to avail itself of the opportunity to borrow from the fund in a **crisis**, it must be prepared to reduce its rate of consumption and the amenities that have been gained by the community over the years.

* In a **crisis**, we would be able to go to the fund to get whatever we could to assist with our balance of payments.

* Whilst I commend the Government on its attitude to the International Monetary Fund and its desire to have another line of defence, reserve or bulwark on which we can depend in a **crisis**, I sincerely trust that a very serious study will be made of the position of our primary industries.

* They had to work under grossly overcrowded conditions, and an urgent request was made to the Universities Commission for an extra grant of 600,000 to meet what was described as a **crisis** condition at the University.

* In view of the proposed adjournment of the Parliament for a week, - and of the grave international situation, will the Prime Minister undertake not to involve Australia in any irrevocable decision, and to recall the Parliament if there should be any accentuation of the gravity of the present **crisis**?

* Fourthly, we are faced with a world currency **crisis** concerning gold, sterling and the dollar.

* The worst feature of the Cuban **crisis** was that it obscured the much more important India China conflict.

* Now that Catholic authorities in almost every State have indicated **crisis** conditions in their schools, particularly in respect of accommodation and teachers in both primary and secondary schools, does the Government have in mind a realistic programme of financial assistance to private schools?

* I suggest that our economic **crisis** started in February, 1960, when the Government abolished all import controls.

* In the current **crisis** between the United States of America and Cuba, if war actually breaks out between the United States and Cuba or the United States and Russia, will Australia be automatically committed?

* I think it will be readily conceded that for far too long the Government did nothing about this impending **crisis**.

* Some have said that the 500,000,000 people of Europe have held the 3,000,000,000 people of the world in a state of **crisis** for centuries.

* It is our national lifeline and our mainstay in time of **crisis**.

* With regard to the question of youth employment it is quite obvious even though it is not recognized in some places by some people that this country has reached  a  **crisis**.

* The people - particularly the parents - need to know the Government's plans to meet the **crisis** which confronts them.

* Whether we like it or not, the **crisis** exists.

* Although we have had a **crisis** recently in the timber industry, what has the New South Wales Government done?

* So long as a government fails to take adequate steps, so long does the **crisis** continue.

* Out of the **crisis** largely, though not entirely, of the Government's own making which followed the removal of import restrictions imposed under the power vested in the Government by the Customs Act, the Government passed all this hurried emergency legislation.

* A serious housing **crisis** exists there.

* To meet this **crisis** the Government proposes to increase its house building programme from 1,200 to 1,800 houses a year.

* The McCarrey Committee, which was established to inquire into and report on the land and housing **crisis** in Western Australia, submitted a report and made seven important recommendations, of which only one has been implemented, namely, the setting up of a committee.

* I say this to the honorable member: If I assert that the need is reaching a **crisis** in the metropolitan areas in the eastern States, that is not to imply that country roads should be neglected.

* JOB CRISIS ON NORTH COAST.

* I have always thought that it is highly desirable that members of the Parliament should never feel such an overwhelming necessity to retain their seats that in an atmosphere of **crisis** they vote perhaps for economic reasons rather than other reasons.

* Every one knows that in the last fifteen or thirty minutes of a **crisis** - we should hope it will never come - consultation cannot take place, but consultation can take place before that situation is reached.

* Mr. Attlee  had to go to Washington in 195 1 when the Korea **crisis** arose.

* And lo and behold, who did we find in Washington in 1955 telling the American Government that it should not consider nuclear weapons in the second Formosan **crisis**?

* We could have come closer to the United in the events that might lead up to a **crisis** as a result of something that could have been put in the agreement.

* The **crisis** in education which our Prime Minister, as Minister for Education and Science, stoutly denied existed, still continues.

* If we really need evidence about the **crisis** in education, surely there was pictorial evidence on the front page of yesterday's Melbourne 'Age'.

* This is an indication of the **crisis** in education.

* Indeed, 1968 will be a **crisis** year for Australian agriculture because drought, devaluation, exorbitant shipping freight increases and the ever-present price squeeze are all putting pressure on primary industries, many of which were facing critical situations before the year started.

* The philosophy of the Government is still a hit and miss affair, using the Reserve Bank now and then like a huge bulldozer as its main weapon to dampen down the spending at **crisis** times.

* However, a **crisis** point has been reached in my electorate - a **crisis** point in the industrial life of this nation.

* It is also a critical and **crisis** point for the vast majority of unionists and citizens of Collinsville and their families.

* It is the sort of situation most politicians will avoid like a taipan, unless they have the guts required at **crisis** level.

* The future of this relationship is bright but great concern is felt regarding the dangers of  dependng  on one customer for nearly 25 per cent, of cur export sales and the major **crisis** which would be faced if adverse trade balances or any reasons caused the Japanese Government to restrict imports at any time.

* In this hour of **crisis**, when we are engaged in resisting this aggression, we are confident that we shall have your sympathy and support as well as the sympathy and support of all countries, not only because of their friendly relations with us, but also because our struggle is in the interests of world peace and is directed to the elimination of deceit, dissimulation and force in international relations.

* From this point of view alone, as from many other points of view, it is in our interest to end the present confrontation **crisis** as soon as possible.

* I will not traverse here the history of that **crisis**.

* But, obviously the current **crisis** will not wait until the Government decides to measure up to its defence responsibilities.

* This is all very reminiscent of the Government's inactivity over the months of the West New Guinea **crisis**, when it constantly excused itself from taking any initiative by insisting that Australia was not a party principal to the dispute.

* What is really involved :in this bill is not  a  general borrowing programme but the ability to borrow for a short term during a **crisis** in our balance of payments situation.

* Does the honorable member or the Government anticipate a **crisis** in our balance of payments which it will not be able to meet by long-term loans or by the 300,000,000 dollars that we already have in the International Monetary Fund?

* My friend from Sturt says that it is not possible to get loans when there is a **crisis**; and of course the 
Government anticipates that **crisis**.

* I also anticipate a **crisis**, and anybody who knows the position in connexion with our trading with overseas companies since this Government came into power anticipates a **crisis**.

* Before the suspension of the sitting, I pointed out that the purpose of the bill was to increase our International Monetary Fund quota by 100,000,000 dollars so that we could borrow from the fund in a period of **crisis**.

* Such a **crisis** would arise if we had an adverse balance of payments; that is, if we bought abroad much more than we sold abroad.

* We shall not achieve that objective by encouraging unnecessary imports and precipitating a **crisis** due to- adverse' trade balances.

* Nor shall we get out of the difficul ties that confront this country by increasing our quota- in the international Monetary Fund' in order to meet an expected **crisis**  in1  respect of our trade balances.

* For these reasons, the party to which 1 belong is quite, right in opposing this bill, which provides for an expected **crisis** caused by an adverse balance of payments.

* If the Government does not wish to provide against a **crisis** in our balance of payments, would not our existing quota of 300,000,000 dollars enable us to meet the difficulties that lie ahead?

* A great number of bodies associated with our education system claim that education in Australia has reached the **crisis** stage.

* Whether this is so or not depends on one's interpretation of the word " **crisis** ".

* The Minister said - 
The Cyprus **crisis** had not had any effect upon the agreement on dried fruit marketing reached between the Australian Dried Fruits Control Board and Greek and Turkish interests last year.

* The likely effect of a protracted Cyprus **crisis** on sales of Australian dried vine fruit is unknown.

* There are three main reasons for the problem reaching the **crisis** stage that I mentioned.

* The third and most important reason for the present **crisis** situation - or so I am told - is the process of negotiation between the employing authority, the Executive of the Organisation, and the Officers Association.

* This applies to growers and millers alike, but, perhaps more importantly, the whole economic future of the sugar industry is at stake and unless we have some bright financial star on the horizon we can expect a grave **crisis** in the future - and, in certain sections of the industry, in the immediate future.

* If this state of affairs continues, with this disastrous free market price, the whole sugar industry must suffer a grave **crisis**.

* The Minister for Health does not believe that there is a **crisis** in education in Australia.

* The Minister said that more money has been spent on education and therefore there is no **crisis** in education.

* Lack of expenditure on education at the primary, secondary and technical levels is, therefore, the first cause of the present **crisis** in this country.

* Yet, earlier this afternoon, the Minister for Health suggested in all seriousness to this House that there was no **crisis** in education in this country.

* The future of Berlin and the **crisis** which we are now facing and, indeed, through which we have lived since the Berlin airlift incident of 1948 is, of course, intimately bound up with the future of Germany, and the future of Germany is tangled up with the question of disarmament and nuclear tests.

* No matter how Government supporters try to distort the facts that emerge from the present economic **crisis**, it is clear that the people no longer have confidence in the Government.

* It would be fair to contend that he has less to gain than Australia has from a peaceful settlement of the Asian **crisis**.

* It was fashionable to do it then because a very serious situation, in fact a **crisis**, had arisen there.

* I believe that this may obviate a great **crisis** - a great confrontation - with China which could certainly occur if the United States has the inclination in the .

* In the United States of America production has declined to such an extent that the Americans are buying margarine and putting it in their reserves for use in the event of a national **crisis**.

* Apparently, some **crisis** is arising in his own ranks, for he found it necessary to come into the House last evening and address himself almost solely to honorable members on the Government side and he almost completely ignored the Opposition.

* We are a young country which must, traditionally, have a chronic overseas reserves **crisis**.

* I know that you,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  have a very clear recollection in your mind of what happened in 1942 when the then Australian Labour Party government of the day, led by the late John Curtin, in a time of great **crisis**, I admit, went screaming for help to the United States Government in our time of trouble.

* In passing, I draw the attention of the House to Australia's role in this very difficult international **crisis**.

* The solution of the Berlin **crisis** and of the problem of German unification, with one central democratically elected parliament, is as far off as ever after sixteen years.

* Let me stress again that the ideologies of West and East differ so greatly that a solution to the Berlin **crisis** will continue to remain remote and difficult.

* However, looking at the matter as fairly as possible, and having regard to the fact that the tests have followed the recent Berlin **crisis**, there is a distinct suspicion that they hinge on the flare-up of the Berlin trouble.

* The round table is still the only sound, sane way to tackle a world **crisis**, whether at the summit level, the Foreign Ministers' level or the top level of the United Nations.

* The Government, to meet the position which has arisen because of its refusal to conserve reserves, and because of the serious balance-of-payments **crisis** which exists, has relied increasingly upon the induction of private investment.

* Then, of course, we have the tragic episode of the Suez **crisis** of only three or four years ago.

* I remind honorable members of the arguments that he advanced at the time of the Suez **crisis**.

* When the British adopted a bellicose attitude in the Suez **crisis** he supported them.

* He said that Australian education had reached a dramatic **crisis** and would soon explode.

* I suggest that in this' time of economic **crisis** the.

* There is a **crisis** in education in this country.

* Everybody acknowledges quite readily that there is a **crisis** in education in Australia to-day.

* But if the Premiers come cap in hand to the Prime Minister and say there is a **crisis** in education, that a committee of inquiry must be set up, and that urgent need exists for a grant to meet the special threat existing at this moment, surely that is enough answer to those on the Government side who suggest that we are fighting State rights.

* The Prime Minister mentioned migration as being a serious and important reason for the **crisis** in education.

* The Government seeks to allay public apprehension by declaring that there is no economic **crisis**.

* Although the Cabinet had been closely closeted in the consideration of this very matter for two days, having found it essential to set aside all other business in order to deliberate on inflation as a matter of first importance, the Treasurer thought fit to announce to the public that there was no inflation **crisis** in Australia.

* That estimate of what is involved in the present **crisis** is a little different from that which honorable members opposite are prepared to make.

* They are the people who defend it in time of **crisis**.

* In any **crisis**, whether it be internal or external, one would expect members of the various political parties, as Australians, to come together in an endeavour to find a remedy for our ills and to work together for the betterment of the people.

* In 1949 or 1950, we began to talk about the **crisis** in the universities and we recognized the existence of an emergency, but there were special circumstances.

* As Professor Butlin said in the article referred to- 
Between 1939 and 1946, university enrolments doubled, but in this period of national **crisis** nothing could be done towards a corresponding improvement in university facilities.

* We are now faced with a **crisis**, just as we were immediately after World War II.

* The honorable member for Bonython went on to say -  lt would be well if we had some authoritative body, experienced in the higher branches of engineering, to examine the various Australian industries to learn to what extent they would be able to undertake the responsibility of producing our essential needs in time of **crisis**.

* In other words, this is not a measure designed .primarily to raise revenue; it is a measure arising out of what might be called an import **crisis** in the Australian economy, designed to dampen down economic activity in a particular direction.

* As was pointed .out :in the House recently that import **crisis** - if it exists - exists .purely as a result of this Government's decision in February this -year to remove entirely import licensing as it .then operated in Australia.

* I shall have a -little more to say about the suddenness of .this **crisis**.

* That unrestricted import flow has led to the serious **crisis** that Australia faces now in relation to its overseas balance of payments.

* Prices which previously appeared as a part of inflation now appear under a new guise called an import **crisis**.

* The most recent example in our mind is the **crisis** which occurred during last year and which required the introduction of the Government's November measures.

* While I do not say that we should avoid these temporary measures when a **crisis** is on us, I do argue that we should also be doing those things which will avoid a recurrence of the **crisis**.

* As I said, I put forward in this place, apparently without effect on the Government, some positive steps which I believe could and should be taken, and should have been taken a long time ago, in order to prevent a recurrence of the kind of **crisis** we have seen.

* It seems to me that it is much better to deal with this problem gradually, sensibly and quietly rather than to let it accumulate to a point where a **crisis** arises.

* For example, we have seen the Korean war, the Suez **crisis** and many other conflicts; we have seen great advances in medicine and surgery; and we have witnessed great excursions into outer space with astronauts travelling- at the rate of 17,000 miles an hour.

* You and I,  Sir, know  of the serviceman whom we admired in action and who rejected the opportunity to go out sick or injured because he wanted to stay with his colleagues in a moment of **crisis**.

* The level of savings shows that the **crisis** is not a **crisis** of purchasing power, he says, but rather of confidence.

* It has manufactured a phony **crisis** to excuse its shabby parliamentary manoeuvres, to justify its own contempt for the rights of members of this House and to hide the real nature and purpose of its ill conceived legislation.

* During the past week the Minister has attempted to claim that there is a new and extreme state of **crisis** on the waterfront, but what did he say about this in his second reading speech on this Bill?

* The Minister now says the decision was made on Monday, but what **crisis** developed, what emergency appeared between Thursday of last week and Monday of this week that changed '* considered conclusions " into pressing and urgent legislation?

* Last year, during the Address-in-Reply debate, I said that 1961 was going to be a year of **crisis**.

* How long do we intend to go on drifting from **crisis** to **crisis** and then attempting to deal with them hour by hour.

* There has been no world **crisis** to create a sudden demand for wool and there has been no world shortage.

* In recent years the sugar growers have been caught in a period of **crisis**, and the Commonwealth Government has helped them on the two occasions that they have asked it to do so.

* These loans should help the industry over the **crisis** period and everyone in this House hopes they will.

* We hope that by 1970 the **crisis** period will have passed.

* If it is still a **crisis** period then, obviously governments at that time will need to look at the picture.

* In the circumstances of the old kind of war, this co-operation could be achieved by the union of our forces in the field at the time of **crisis**.

* In the circumstances of the new kind of war, defence co-operation will not be effective unless it is practised in the years before the **crisis** occurs.

* Then we have the curious attitude of the Philippines in this present **crisis**.

* A great many negotiations and a great many discussions go on, and we get no clarity about them, whether they are on the United States naval communication station or on this **crisis**, until the Prime Minister considers that they might be election material.

* On 9th July - nothing in this **crisis** is recent - Subandrio, in promising Malaysia a terrible confrontation, to use his word, said - 
I address a question to the Prime Minister.

* Is this position now causing **crisis** conditions in such State functions as hospitalisation, education, transport, local government and police administration?

* It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government faces a **crisis** on unemployment.

* This Government states that the economic squeeze has not done anything to hurt the worker or to hurt industry, but in "The Sun " to-day we read these headlines: "Textile Crisis Claimed, 1,000 lose jobs", ; Carpet Mill Puts 160 Off", " Meat Industry Dismissals ", and " Seven Timber Mills Forced to Close ".

* In the Melbourne " Herald " of 31st January last, we read - 
The Victorian Home Builders' Conference wishes to make the following submission in relation to the present **crisis** in the home-building industry and its ancillaries in Victoria.

* Yet this Government claims there is no **crisis**.

* The **crisis** in the industry has reached a point where mass unemployment must occur unless remedial action is taken to ease restrictions on long-term housing finance.

* The present **crisis** is a result both of the more selective and restrictive attitude to housing finance adopted by State lending authorities last year, and of the Federal Government's current credit restriction policy.

* We can help to meet the **crisis** by conserving our overseas balances now.

* Consequently, I want to say this: The Minister for Supply  (Mr. Hulme)  has made every endeavour to avert the **crisis**, but he operates the factory under a charter which prevents any opportunity for stability or expansion.

* Now the Prime Minister tells us once again, in the midst of a **crisis** of unemployment and declining production, that our international reserves are in a " position of abounding health ".

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell)  has put forward a practical plan to meet this immediate **crisis**.

* In our present **crisis** the Menzies Government has yet again shown its lack of energy and foresight.

* Could the Prime Minister be more conciliatory about this matter, particularly in view of the rapidly developing financial **crisis** in local government and because the proposal for such a conference is supported by the State Liberal and Country Parties, the Australian Council of Local Government Associations and the Opposition in the Parliament?

* He failed in World War II., he failed in connexion with the Suez **crisis** and he failed shamefully to protect Australia's vital interests in this case.

* It is a period of approaching financial **crisis** for Australia.

* They are simply these: The minute that Britain enters the European Common Market Britain will be faced with a **crisis**.

* When that **crisis** comes it will have no greater effect on any trade than on the woollen trade.

* Britain's **crisis** will be Australia's opportunity to help Britain to transfer its industries to this country.

* He admits that that is an accurate piece of reporting but what he attempts to do now is to create the impression that he wanted those statements to relate not so much to the incidents in the Gulf of Tonkin, not to the present **crisis** that has arisen over the attack upon the American naval forces, but to the whole of the incidents in South East Asia and to South Vietnam.

* I shall pass no com ment, none at all, but I want the House to make up its mind whether what he said did refer to the present **crisis**, did refer to what happened in the Gulf of Tonkin.

* In fact, they were taking part in an attack in the present **crisis**.

* Just as in periods of great **crisis** when there is a war on, when there is a **crisis** in industry the people affected have always had to tura to Labor.

* But the wheat farmers will have to turn to Labor because the Labor Party is the only party that will get the country out of a **crisis** whenever it is in a **crisis**.

* Who will say that there is no **crisis** in the wheat industry?

* Who will dare to stand up and say that wheat farmers are not facing the worst and most disastrous **crisis** of its long history?

* It is a **crisis**.

* The Country Party is doing nothing at all to meet the present **crisis**.

* Is it any wonder that farmers are beginning to remember that always in time of **crisis** the Labor Party is the best party to get this country out of difficulty?

* We advocated changes in the penal provisions for 12 months or so before the Government became aware of the need and it was only in the last stages when we were getting closer to a **crisis** that the Government took notice of us.

* His realization of it was at times one of the better aspects of this Government's foreign policy, although I think that a lot of the Government's influence in Asia was negatived by its foolish policy in the Suez Canal **crisis**.

* The Labour Party has for some years now been emphasizing that a **crisis** exists in Australian education.

* We have been at some pains to impress upon this Government that such a condition of **crisis** does exist, and we have raised this matter again to-night simply because during last year's debate on this question the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  reiterated his point of view - and presumably that of the Government - that no such **crisis** condition did exist.

* We say not only that a **crisis** condition exists but also that in a number of important respects the position is deteriorating.

* But at least the honourable member for Bennelong, unlike some supporters of the Government, has been prepared to concede that there is a **crisis** in education.

* Indeed, if I may use his exact terms, he said: 
There  is  a complete **crisis** in education.

* Now he informs the House that there is a **crisis** in education as though he has discovered something new about education.

* Has not every Opposition member in this Parliament been pointing to the **crisis** in education at the primary, secondary and technical levels for a very long period?

* The fact remains that the Opposition has pointed out that until such time as the Government is prepared to accept the same responsibility for primary, secondary and technical education that it now accepts for university education the **crisis** to which the honourable member for Bennelong has referred will continue.

* One can at least appreciate that the honourable member for Bennelong has had a change of mind on this question and he now agrees with the Australian Teachers Federation, parents and friends associations and members on this side of the House who have pointed to the **crisis** in education at the primary, secondary and technical levels.

* This brings me to the point made by the honourable member for Bennelong - the **crisis** that exists in education in Australia; the representations that have been made by the Australian Teachers Federation and by educationalists in every State for a more active participation on the part of the Commonwealth at the primary, secondary and technical levels.

* I reiterate that when the debate was in progress last year the honourable member for Bennelong, who now claims that, there is a **crisis** in education in Australia, had nothing to say, and the Minister for Education and Science dismissed the motion out of hand.

* The most deplorable aspect of  Mr. Holt's  Budget speech was the impression it made of a lack of awareness of the gravity of Australia's present economic **crisis**.

* If the Government wants to help Tasmania in its present **crisis**, why does it not give Tasmania the 9,000,000 that it will receive for the sale of the Bell Bay works.

* I should have thought that the Minister for Shipping and Transport - the understudy for the Minister for Trade and Industry - would have taken the opportunity, if the Minister for Trade and Industry does not intend to do so, to say something about the serious and fundamental **crisis** that now exists in the affairs of the Tariff Board and in the making of tariffs.

* It was introduced merely to meet a **crisis** that is not a military **crisis**.

* How is it that over the last three weeks we have discovered that a state of **crisis** exists?

* Do we, three weeks later, face any different situation - except, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the **crisis** of 5th December next, when there is to be a Senate election?

* The Menzies Government probably will not last a year and a **crisis** will certainly come within eighteen months.

* We are now approaching a **crisis** in this country, whether honorable members opposite like it or not, and this **crisis** is coming because of the actions of our pathetic, unbusinesslike, mismanaged government.

* Let us analyse the background1 of this **crisis**.

* Its members have not the stomach to tackle a **crisis** when it occurs.

* It has to pay interest on the money borrowed, and it has to face the problems that arise from borrowing when .a **crisis** occurs.

* Speakers on the Government side have sought to justify the measure by stating that we need a reserve upon which to draw in case of a **crisis**, in case of need.

* We do not propose to help the Government to provide emergency measures such as those proposed by this bill for the purpose of meeting a **crisis** which this Government has done so much to create.

* We are not facing an immediate balance of payments **crisis**.

* So there is no foreseeable financial **crisis** due to our failure to be able to meet balance of payments obligations.

* The first point I wish to make - I reiterate it - is that there is no immediate balance of payments **crisis** for Australia.

* When it does come we will have a **crisis** with our balance of payments.

* It is pointless and a heartless disregard of the national position and the state of **crisis** to ask the States to do something further about education.

* The **crisis** of education is at its peak in teacher training.

* If we like to read the papers we can get the full story of the power **crisis** in central Queensland.

* Not long ago teachers in New South Wales went on strike over the **crisis** within the State education system.

* I want to say very briefly that not only is this proposal recognised by the industry as a practical and positive means of assistance in a time of **crisis** but also it is regarded as something that breaks completely new ground in assistance for the sugar industry in Australia.

* It would like to find a way to give them special assistance; a way to assist them independently of the established growers who have greater economic stability and therefore greater strength to meet the **crisis** with which they are confronted.

* In Victoria these vital institutions are left to flounder from **crisis** to **crisis**.

* This kind of **crisis** is expensive, and it is unpardonable because nothing is more important than the health of the community.

* Sooner or later, there will be a **crisis** in the Victorian hospital system.

* Far too often the Minister will make a statement outside the House, or inside the House, when there is some military **crisis**.

* The position in Malaysia, the position in Vietnam, indeed the position in our part of the world, cannot be satisfactorily considered purely in the circumstances of some military **crisis**.

* There is a continuing social, economic and political **crisis**.

* How could the Cuban **crisis** of 1962 have been solved in the way it was solved if the Soviet Union and the United States had not had diplomatic relations - if they had not both been members of the United Nations so that the Secretary-General could act as an intermediary between them?

* That **crisis** was risky enough as it was.

* It is not a wise move to make predictions in politics, but I will make the prediction that the next confidence **crisis** in Australia will occur when the next Leader of the Opposition is elected.

* We had a confidence **crisis** when  Dr Evatt  was appointed Leader of the Opposition.

* We had a confidence **crisis** when the honorable member for Melbourne  (Mr. Calwell)  was appointed* Leader of the Opposition.

* We will have the next confidence **crisis** when the next Leader of the Opposition is appointed.

* As Australia's reserve of overseas funds has risen to more than 800 million, compared with 300 million in the **crisis** caused by over-importing three years ago- 

 - Mr Chairman, the subject on which I wish to speak tonight in the time allowed me relates to ali three of the appropriations now before the Committee.

* It concerns the **crisis** in the Tasmanian hop industry.

* No doubt exists that there is a **crisis** within it.

* This **crisis** has been brought about by several factors that came to a climax in this year.

* This will mean fewer workers and a greater **crisis** at the level of production in this industry.

* I refer to the **crisis** facing growers.

* The big grower can survive this **crisis**, but the small grower cannot if faced with a similar year in 1970. 
fails to meet the **crisis** in education by making an emergency grant of at least 10 million to the States; 
Government to introduce a scheme which was in keeping with the requirements of this modern age.

* Money has been wasted on Centurion tanks just as millions of pounds have been wasted on the national service training scheme which was absolutely useless in a time of **crisis**.

* I hope that the Minister for Defence will reply to me and other speakers and give us the real position in regard to the statement on submarines by the British rear-admiral  and our own efforts in relation to submarines, and will assure the Australian people, in this time of great **crisis**, that the submarines which are on loan from the Royal Navy will not be withdrawn immediately.

* We have been given to understand that the Suez **crisis** is the reason for the increase in the local price of petrol.

* I trust, therefore, that the Government will take the precautionary step of retaining ready access to the services of those public servants who have the experience necessary to deal with the **crisis** which may arise despite the steps to be taken under this bill.

* Is it possible that France is the difficult partner amongst the Western powers in this Berlin **crisis**?

* In this industry, we have been told for several months, there is a serious **crisis**, particularly in the production of smaller vehicles.

* The Minister tells us that recently the manufacturers have submitted tothe Goyernment that they are facing a **crisis** threatening their existence and future development.

* He recognises the extent and seriousness of the **crisis** threatening their existence and future development.

* What I am concerned to know is whether the Minister thinks that this **crisis** can be dealt with by action taken against what he calls dumping.

* Is he suggesting to us that the only or main cause of the **crisis** in the industry is what he outlined in his speech?

* But I question whether the **crisis** outlined, admitted and recognised by the Minister is solely caused by these practices.

* The **crisis** that we are talking about now is not one that has recently come about but has existed for some time.

* The Minister looks at a number of factors which might give us an indication where the **crisis** originated.

* It seems to me that these current Government arrangements have contributed substantially to the **crisis** which the Minister now admits exists.

* It is not just a matter of a Japanese practice having contributed to this **crisis**.

* At this stage  I  do not intend to do more than give some indication of what these current Government arrangements are and how they may have contributed to the **crisis** which the Minister admits we now have in the industry.

* So if the Minister is suggesting that the substantial thing that has caused this **crisis** is the dumping procedure, he is seeking to escape the consequences of his own plan A and SV plan.

* We welcome the Minister's statement that he recognises that a serious **crisis** exists in the motor car industry.

* But we are satisfied that unless he looks a good deal more closely at the pricing policies of Australian producers, and at the Government's arrangements to protect motor car production in Australia, he will be failing to tackle the cause of this **crisis**.

* But this does not indicate that the **crisis**, which the Minister admits exists, will be met.

* I have shown that in the Government's current arrangements and in the price policies of the Australian car manufacturers, there are factors that could have and must have contributed considerably to this **crisis**.

* The main point of this legislation is very simple, although the Government has attempted to create an atmosphere of **crisis**.

* Yet we have this panic legislation in an atmosphere of synthetic **crisis**, lt was pointed out by the State Minister for Lands that the main complex to the north, that is the area which is vested in the Commonwealth today and which it has held by various acquisitions between 1912 and the present time - an area of 27 square miles - would not be affected in any way.

* These matters need much more consideration than can be given to them late at night on a Bill that was introduced with a minimum of publicity and a maximum air of **crisis**.

* I agree with the honorable member for Yarra that honorable members of this Parliament, and any other person interested in the Cuban **crisis**, should look at Cuban history.

* The **crisis** of recent weeks did not come upon the world with any remarkable suddenness.

* For my part, I must say unashamedly and unhesitatingly that there has been something manifestly unreal about the Cuban **crisis**.

* The second major aspect of the Cuban **crisis** that does not ring true to me concerns the missile bases themselves.

* Another aspect of the Cuban **crisis** that does not ring true is that it has diverted attention from what I regard as one of the stark tragedies of this century.

* In this case our attention has been diverted from the Indian affair by the Cuban **crisis**.

* To-day Labour is portraying a **crisis** in this regard.

* No **crisis** exists.

* Is it to wait until a **crisis** arises and then to produce a policy to solve it?

* Or is the function cf leadership that of arousing public consciousness that trouble is in prospect, of ensuring public understanding that there is a problem which ought not to be allowed to develop to **crisis** proportions and, having aroused that consciousness, to produce a policy to abate the problem?

* 1, for one, think that many people in Australia to-day are doing a great disservice to Australian education by constantly referring to a **crisis** that exists in education.

* In 1945, any one who cried that there was a **crisis** in education could have proved the point quite conclusively.

* to talk about a **crisis** in education is to decry a system that I believe would bear comparison with any system in the world.

* On the other hand, in this country, for all the faults of the system and the **crisis** that Opposition members talk about, it does not matter where a child lives.

* This is a matter that could well be discussed here; the exchange of ideas would be of benefit to the university students and, I am sure, to the honorable member for Barton, who is interested to talk about the **crisis** in education.

* Extra grants from the Commonwealth are not necessary to beat this so-called **crisis**, as Opposition members label it.

* The parents are meeting the cost of the education of those children, and the real **crisis** has occurred, not in the governmentowned schools but in the privately owned schools.

* When the Suez **crisis** late in 1956 found the Government posturing but powerless, reform could not be much longer delayed.

* As the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr. Hasluck)  knows, probably better than I do, not a week passes without some new **crisis** arising, something new to worry about.

* Each week or every few weeks a new **crisis** arises.

* Few people realise how suddenly the sunshine of economic prosperity in Australia could be dimmed by an international **crisis** not far from our shores.

* I think the first thing we have to do is to discuss whether there is a **crisis**.

* These honorable members have stood up in their places and said that there is a serious **crisis**.

* I believe that there is a **crisis** today to which we ought to pay much more serious attention at home as well as abroad.

* What we want now is leadership with courage, with resolution and with realism, and to do away with this inadequate nonchalence, which is almost traitorous - but I would rather say " treacherous " - with which up to the present we have been handling this **crisis** in Australia's history.

* Shipping freights paid to these lines constitute the heaviest contribution to Australia's balance of payments **crisis**.

* I remind the House that in the time of Australia's greatest **crisis** - the Second World War - it was found that decentralisation was possible and the Federal Government was prepared to help industries become established in country areas.

* Despite these achievements, there is a great **crisis** in education in New South Wales and that statement could be applied also to other States.

* This is the immediate staff **crisis** and it is typical of the position in every State.

* This Government, on taking office, found that the most obvious factor in the **crisis** was in the realm of the universities.

* The **crisis** that was met then is still being met and ultimately will be defeated.

* Whatever the merits or demerits of those discussions may be, the fact remains that a further and immediate **crisis** exists in our secondary education system, especially in regard to the teaching of the sciences and mathematics.

* In the latter case, which has been mentioned this afternoon, whilst possibly it is the most urgent **crisis** of all, the remedy lies almost entirely in the provision of teachers.

* When we consider that the vast majority of those students are doing science subjects, we realize something of the magnitude of the **crisis** that is facing our secondary teaching institutions.

* Any reasonable person, faced with this situation, would ask one potent question: If the Commonwealth Government has shown itself to be successful in meeting the earlier and equally grave **crisis** at the level of tertiary education, is not that Government morally obliged to act again at the secondary level?

* As I have shown already, when a **crisis** threatened our universities and the church colleges, which, across Australia, form an integral part of their framework, these same universities and church colleges went with both hands ready to accept public money which ensured their survival and their continued growth.

* In case some one tries so to misrepresent me, in spite of the earlier case that I made with reference to a **crisis** in a particular field, let me reiterate that I believe this action is being taken to fill a specific and urgent need which is common to all secondary schools.

* In my view this Government has acted honestly and in a timely and enlightened manner to meet yet another educational **crisis**.

* reached at the time of the Korean **crisis**, there had been these fluctuations, some of them quite marked, over the decade, and it was really remarkable that at the end of this ten-year period the average price of wool was lower than it had been in any of the earlier ten years.

* The Australian Labour Party says that there is a **crisis** in education in Australia today.

* The **crisis** has been looming for some time.

* Yet  Senator Gorton  says that there is no **crisis** in education.

* The Minister for Education in New South Wales, who is a member of the Australian Country Party, within the last few months gave to the New South Wales Teachers Federation this statement of the position - 
The other dimension of the **crisis**,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  is the acute shortage of qualified teachers.

* Those who can see clearly and have enough confidence and courage to express their view say that we have not yet experienced a real **crisis** in education.

* The **crisis** is still to come.

* It is sufficiently apparent from the evidence that unless something better is done in the next five to ten years a serious **crisis** will occur in Australian universities.

* The United Kingdom forces were built up in that general area during the period of confrontation and we were well aware of the intention of the United Kindom Government to reduce its forces once the confrontation **crisis** either abated or terminated.

* Education in Crisis: Meeting at St Mary's Hall.

* The requirement that more money be spent on education for the reasons which I have mentioned, which are not peculiar to Australia but apply throughout the world, constitutes, as I see it, the biggest single cause of the present **crisis** in CommonwealthState relationships.

* This has brought about a **crisis** so far as we in the Country Party are concerned.

* The **crisis** in the industry has existed for the greater part of this year, and intensely since the beginning of June.

* In this situation of **crisis** the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr. Adermann)  told us in a statement on July 7th that the Government did not intend to take action to compel the inclusion of unusable leaf in the manufacture of cigarettes and tobacco for consumption by Australian smokers.

* This is nearly three months since the **crisis** developed.

* There is no reference whatever to " in the present Vietnamese **crisis** ".

* The reason for my objection to this statement was that emphasis was given to the words, " in the present Vietnamese **crisis** ", this morning by the Prime Minister.

* Again this evening the Minister at the table  (Mr. McMahon)  chose to make an ' attack based upon the statement referring to " in the present Vietnamese **crisis** ".

* The whole assertion that has been made today by the Prime Minister, by the Minister at the table and by other speakers opposite was on the interpretation that I was speaking about the present **crisis**.

* If the Minister wants to take some technical advantage of a word, I have not recalled exactly what 1 said, but the truth of the matter is that I was talking about the war as a whole and not this **crisis**.

* The entire criticism made by the Government today has been based upon the assertion that my remarks were concerned with the exchange of shots in the **crisis**.

* The storage **crisis** created by this situation led to the need for the Loan (Emergency Wheat Storage) Act 1955 under which the Commonwealth Government found it necessary to guarantee to the Commonwealth Bank the repayment of a loan of $7 million for the construction of emergency storages.

* The next **crisis** in the wheat industry occurred in 1957, when  Sir John  Teasdale, who was then  Chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board, was prompted to issue a Press statement recommending the reduction of acreages to limit the annual crop to 150 million bushels.

* They were reported in one newspaper in these terms - 
Australia's wheat industry faced a **crisis** unequalled since the depression of the 1930's, the  Chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board  (Sir John Teasdale)  said today.

* The **crisis** is no passing phase.

* It is no wonder that this Government faces an economic **crisis**.

* The first **crisis** was when the Government was elected.

* There was another **crisis** in 1952, he said, when the Government introduced the horror Budget.

* He went on to say that there had been another **crisis** in 1954, and another in 1956.

* To-day, we have still another **crisis**.

* One **crisis** after another.

* The Prime Minister went abroad on the occasion of the Suez **crisis** and made a laughing-stock of himself by his intervention with Nasser.

* Now he has mediated in the South African **crisis** and the South Africans have left the Commonwealth of Nations.

* Certainly they present us with a **crisis** in the relations between east and west.

* It is a **crisis** which, if it is recognized for what it is and is handled resolutely and wisely, could lead to our ultimate survival, but which, if we temporize and find excuses for not facing up to the issues involved, will certainly lead in the long run to the destruction of the Western world as we understand it.

* In every **crisis**, from Suez to Hungary and to Indo-China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has succeeded in shifting the onus of initiating nuclear war onto the West.

* In our area the kind of **crisis** at present threatening does not call for deployment of Polaris missiles or for a VLF station.

* When we come to building-up situations, such as the Cuban **crisis** last November, it is possible to apply joint control at the time.

* When it appeared that a **crisis** was arising in the Agricultural Council because Queensland and Victoria, which were genuinely and honestly policing the margarine quotas, objected to what was going on in New South Wales, that State realized that it had to do some face-saving or be tossed out of the Agricultural Council.

* At a time of **crisis** in the dairy industry, with a possible expansion of the European Common Market and a world surplus of butter, we have a government in Australia - I refer to the New South Wales Labour Government - which is interested only in producing more margarine and says, "To heck with the dairy industry.

* No-one could pretend that the **crisis** between this House and the Senate in 1951 over the structure of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was on a State issue in which the Senate was defending States interests.

* We can sit here and wrack our brains to find a State issue  On  which there has been a **crisis** between this House and the Senate, and I think the only one that we will find is in relation to the Queensland sugar industry.

* That there is a **crisis** - if this is the word that one should use - in education in Australia is unquestionable, but it is the same kind of **crisis** as is to be found in education in every country, lt is the same kind of **crisis** as is to be found in the development of social services around the world.

* is the same kind of **crisis** that attends upon every facet of an exploding population, the development of technology and a thirst for information by increasing millions of people.

* There is, as 1 have said, a **crisis**; but it is the kind of **crisis** against which developing nations such as our own must whet their swords, as it were, and must go into battle to struggle for a place of significance in tha world of tomorrow.

* In order to prevent a **crisis** in the external trade situation, which in itself would have been the result of government action, the Govern, ment had to apply a severe credit squeeze.

* At the present time, when we seem to be reaching a point of **crisis** with respect to some of our older trading relations, there is a need to explore new markets.

* The Government has reached a **crisis** and it is trying to invoke new ideas.

* A great **crisis** hit the country and measures were immediately introduced of a type which caused great havoc in the community.

* Instability, economic backwardness and poverty are the things upon which Communism thrives and these things will exist while the resources of a nation are channelled into external adventures and while the population is diverted from its domestic problems by the creation of an atmosphere of permanent **crisis**.

* There is a real and immediate food **crisis** in many parts of Indonesia and it is not to be wondered at that Communism is strong in Indonesia.

* This was, and indeed remains a **crisis** full of tragedy and danger.

* If the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, who deserves the world's lasting admiration and gratitude for his energy and dedication in this **crisis**, comes to the conclusion that independence is indeed the only solution, Australia will have to consider whether or not to use its good offices with our Commonwealth partners to bring that solution to fruition.

* What help have we in Australia given to India in this time of **crisis**?

* I and other honorable members heard the news of this impending **crisis** approximately five weeks ago.

* In addition to great suffering food **crisis** must greatly affect standing of democratic government in India and Asia.

* India's problems are essentially long term problems, but the famine is a **crisis** which is at hand now.

* According to information given to the House, our Government has reacted to the **crisis** by offering  75,000  tons of wheat for sale on commercial terms.

* This **crisis** may seem to honorable members in this House to be very remote.

* That Minister could find no **crisis** in the coal-mining industry when 7,000 men were losing their jobs.

* The late  President  Kennedy foresaw this **crisis** coming.

* He said - 
One of the great troubles of the last few years was the Suez **crisis**.

* Is it a fact that a financial **crisis** is looming in the United Nations organization; if so, what has brought it about?

* It is a pity it was not brought on while the **crisis** was still a **crisis**.

* 19 on the noticepaper, the Opposition will oppose the motion and I hope that the honorable member for Mackellar and other honorable members who realize that there are important issues still to be determined flowing from this **crisis** will vote with us in favour of the debate continuing.

* The **crisis** in the military sense is now over.

* So now there is no longer a military **crisis** over Cuba aud we can look at this matter for what we can learn for the future, not only in Cuba but in similar places around the world, of which there are all too many.

* Now I come to the immediate **crisis** of the last five weeks and two days.

* He was immediately followed by the Leader of the Opposition, who said - 
The  President  lays the blame for the sudden **crisis** on Russia's intrusion into the western hemisphere.

* For my part, I think the Australian people hope this present **crisis** will not end in armed conflict, but will be resolved peacefully through the United Nations, the seventeenth anniversary of whose birthday occurs to-day.

* The Federal Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes the intervention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, in the Cuban **crisis** so momentous for humanity.

* We have, through United Nations machinery more than anything else, survived and surmounted successfully the political and military aspects of the Cuban **crisis**, but the Cuban **crisis** illustrates a continuing economic and social problem which can also best be met through using and expanding the machinery of the United Nations.

* The next time a balance of payments **crisis** arises a decision will have to be made whether to impose quantitative restrictions or to use the blunt instrument of the credit squeeze that was used in November, 1960, which reduced the demand for imports.

* I understand they have returned empty handed in this period of great **crisis** in the wheat industry.

* Mr. Menzies  does not possess these qualities, which are needed to fit him to be leader  of the country in these times of international **crisis**.

* .- Mr. Deputy Speaker, in the course of Khrushchev's speech to the twentieth congress of the Russian Communist Party in which he was downgrading Stalin, one criticism which he made of Stalin was that Stalin had run unwarranted risks during the 1948 **crisis** in Berlin because the United States at that stage had possessed the atomic bomb and the Soviet Union did not.

* Almost every Berlin **crisis** is a diversion to camouflage the really significant happening.

* The Berlin **crisis** of 1948 concealed the real field of Communist advance which was in China.

* The Berlin **crisis** of to-day is part of a build-up leading to the psychological warfare associated with the resumption of nuclear testing.

* If the Soviets are moving in Asia they create a **crisis** in Berlin.

* If they are moving in Europe they create a **crisis** in Asia.

* The Government of the Federal German Republic cannot reasonably be accused of causing tension in Europe or provoking a **crisis** over Berlin.

* What is the **crisis**?

* The **crisis** has come about because the Rhodesian Government was not prepared to make the concessions that British Governments, Tory and Labour alike, required it to make as a condition of obtaining independence.

* In 1956, as a result of the Suez **crisis**, the memorial was wrecked.

* It is unfortunate that the Suez **crisis** arose and was the cause of the damage, but the people who might be regarded as the owners of the statue are entitled to be consulted.

* In those days, Zeros were attacking our outmoded Wirraways, and the way things are developing now, if another **crisis** should arise, and Australia should be involved in it, we would find the same outmoded aircraft defending us.

* The Suez **crisis** came three years later.

* In August, 1956, he announced that Australia was unprepared and that we had been unready at the time of the Korean **crisis**.

* The right honorable gentleman, on this same date, said - 
Of course, had the water been withdrawn into India as Pakistan feared, a **crisis** would have developed and the whole of the west of Pakistan might have become untenable.

* The Olympic Games coincided with the Hungarian **crisis**.

* .- In considering the recent Cuban **crisis**, as in considering the present position in China, there is a strong tendency to forget the initial United States policy towards the Communist Party of China and the initial United States policy towards the Castro regime.

* The second point on which I wish to comment is this: I do not altogether take the pessimistic view of the Cuban **crisis** that was taken by the honorable member for McPherson  (Mr. Barnes).

* I think the essential fact that has been revealed in the Cuban **crisis**, and which had been suspected before, is the ideological difference between the Soviet Union and Communist China.

* There is a tendency to believe that the biggest issue in the world to-day is the ideological and political differences between Russia  and  trie 
We should remember that there was a first Cuban **crisis** in relation to which the Australian Labour Party made a declaration about the nature of the present regime in Cuba which is important and which is continuing.

* In situations such as that which developed in the first Cuban **crisis** it should be the aim of Australian policy at the United Nations to advocate United Nations action which gives the people of the territory a chance to decide their own future uncoerced.

* I was vividly reminded of the scene that morning in Kuala Lumpur when last night our own Prime Minister, in a similar quiet but firm voice, announced the Government's attitude to yet another **crisis** within the Commonwealth family - a **crisis** even more critical in it's effects on world history.

* Let me not start our examination of events leading up to the present **crisis** by blaming one side only.

* here again there is a subject surely for co-operation, not **crisis**, and for discussion, not dissension.

* Is there really any principle or logic in applying economic sanctions to Rhodesia in its **crisis** which I believe could and should be resolved by peaceful negotiation and cooperation when Britain and ourselves fall over each other to trade with Red China with which we are at war?

* But let no man of whatever race delude himself that the Rhodesian **crisis** is an unimportant counter in the gams of international poker.

* There is not a man or woman, who is a true Australian, who does not share with the Prime Minister the hope that even at this late hour time will be given for reason and compromise to find a solution to the Rhodesian **crisis** where the faults are not all on one side.

* Technically speaking, this **crisis** is an internal matter between Britain and Rhodesia.

* May time be granted and reason prevail and through peaceful co-operation may a satisfactory solution be found to the Rhodesian **crisis** - a solution which will lead to greater happiness and prosperity, not only for all Rhodesians but also for all mankind.

* It is important for us to remember that little piece of history, because I do not think there is any doubt that there is evidence of a further **crisis** developing in our balance of payments position in the next twelve months.

* That surely shows that there is a very great danger of a further balance of payments **crisis** developing in this country.

* There is very little doubt that in the next twelve months it will once again have a balance of payments **crisis** and will then have to make a decision.

* To-day they want a stable policy not only for the protection of Australian industry but also to ensure that our overseas reserves are protected in such a way as to obviate a balance of payments **crisis** with a consequent introduction by the Government of another credit squeeze.

* We make the point that this can be obviated, and that a stable policy can be introduced, only if the Government is once again prepared to impose quantitative import restrictions, not only to protect Australia's industries but also to protect our overseas reserves and to prevent a balance-of-payments **crisis**.
