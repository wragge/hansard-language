## Contexts in which the word "security" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* These children have no certainty and no **security** for the future.

* For social **security** and welfare, government expenditure has increased by 13 per cent.

* The $74.4m allocated, an increase of $9.4m over last year, and the creation of an office of child care in the Department of Social **Security** are moves I welcome.

* In the last Hayden Budget we saw deferments in education, in aged persons housing, defence service housing, capital works for social **security** and postal and telecommunication facilities.

* If one looks at certain departments it will be seen, for example, that in the new Department of Urban and Regional Development the number of Second Division officers has increased in that period from nil to 28; the number in the Department of Minerals and Energy has increased from 11 to 25; the number in the Prime Minister's Department has increased from 25 to 38 and in the Department of Social **Security** the number of Second Division officers has increased from 15 to 28.

* If it were part of the whole package of change in which the social **security** system was going to be amalgamated with something else, in which people were going to receive benefits across the board and this removal of this one was part of a package deal, well then we on this side of the Committee would not be taking any exception to it.

* Continuing warfare will lead to disintegration and the exodus of white people from Rhodesia with no **security** for any of them.

* When I was Minister for Social **Security** I used to sit on the front bench at question time and wonder why I received so few questions from the then Opposition- the LiberalNational Country Parties- on such a range of important welfare issues for which I was responsible.

* It is less relevant today because of the increased scope of government expenditure which is directed at assisting individuals or organisations; for example, health, education, social **security** and welfare programs.

* But I think people lose sight of just how significant has been the achievement of this Government in increasing social **security** benefits.

* I hope that the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  or Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will look at this anomaly and realise the bad economics of the Government's decision, if not the bad humanitarian aspects and do something about it.

* I am interested in pre-school education because I firmly believe that a sound education for our children and .young people is a necessary requirement for Australia's future **security**.

* This effectively reserves our position on reprocessing, as we have said we wish to, pending the outcome of international studies, including- INFCE- the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation; provisions ensuring that adequate physical **security** will be maintained, to guard against theft or other illegal use of nuclear material by groups or individuals; provisions for consultations to ensure the effective implementation of the Agreement; and all these safeguards and controls to cover nuclear material derived from Australian uranium so long as it remains in a form relevant from the point of view of safeguards.

* This will give pensioners more **security** in old age, as nursing home costs will be met and there will be $6 left over to provide the few personal belongings a pensioner may need.

* Only yesterday the significance of the low level of return in rural areas particularly for rural workers was mentioned by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* One could perhaps call him the  de facto  shadow Treasurer, the  de facto  shadow Minister for Health and the  de facto  shadow Minister for Social **Security**, because they seem to be the areas in which he is most interested these days.

* 1 ) Is he able to say whether (a) a Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement official instructed or advised Hubert Dooley, a driver employed at Woorabinda, to take Jane Ray, her grandson and Caroline Saunders with him on the front seat of a hearse carrying a coffin containing the body of  Mrs Ray's  late younger brother, Ruben Salmon, from Rockhampton to Woorabinda on 2 August 1978 for a funeral; (b) the vehicle was stopped several kilometres from Woorabinda and the 4 occupants ordered by the Sergeant of police and/or Manager from Woorabinda to alight and burn their belongings; if so, why; (c) Robert Bundle,  Chairman  of Woorabinda Council, and others engaged  Mr Jeremy  Harper, solicitor, of the Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service, Rockhampton, to obtain redress for  Mrs Ray, Mrs Saunders  and  Mr Dooley  for their loss, intimidation and mistreatment; (d) some of these persons, whose employment, housing and other aspects of personal and family **security** depend on the Woorabinda Manager, after speaking with the then Manager,  Mr Topham,  reversed their requests to  Mr Harper;  (e)  Mr Topham  advised  Mr Harper  that  Mr Dooley  had withdrawn his request for legal aid because he had not understood the full ramifications of what he was saying; (0  Mr Dooley  has been demoted from his job as driver to work at the cemetery; if so, when and why; (g)  Mr Bundle  improperly took from canteen takings $130 with  Mr Topham  's knowledge, to recompense  Mrs Ray  in part for her loss and $30 to recompense  Mr Dooley  in part for his loss of belongings burnt on the roadside; (h) the goods burnt included two blankets and a nightgown given to  Mrs Saunders  before she left hospital in Brisbane to return to Woorabinda via Rockhampton,  Mrs Ray's  suitcase, clothing she had bought for the funeral, a $20 note, the shoes  Mrs Ray  was wearing and her other belongings except the clothes she wore, a 
I wish to raise two basic points.

* It is talking about calling together the United Nations **Security** Council, doing this and doing that, but these proposals do not represent long-term policies as far as Australia 's position in this region of the world is concerned.

* The immigration policy critical to the prosperity, development and **security** of Australia in the 50's was equally admirably suited to our requirements in the 60's.

* I would suggest that the degree of the severity of the view taken by the honourable member for Bendigo derives from the fact that he believes the programme that the Government has determined to introduce in this session before the elections will give independent schools at all levels some **security** for support in the future which they have never had in the past because it will tie payments to a percentage of what it would cost for a government primary or secondary school.

* The visit of a social worker to some of our schools or other areas of social **security** once or twice every year, as occurs in many country areas at present, is entirely unsatisfactory and for that reason also this grant is to be commended.

* The Government has set up a high **security** animal quarantine station.

* The indexation of social **security** and repatriation pensions has been restored and twiceyearly automatic increases will be made.

* In developing the major proposal for the provision of two components the Government was cognisant of the special requirements of the Commonwealth in the fields of protective **security** and the need to retain a relationship of this form of law enforcement with the other general policing functions within the Commonwealth area.

* Notwithstanding those critics, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will next year introduce Labor's health policy and it will in the main provide the fundamental principle that health care is a basic right to be provided according to need and not rationed according to wealth; that 4 out of 5 people will pay less for health insurance coverage than they do now; that as patients they will be guaranteed a free choice of doctors; their doctors will be paid for each service they perform and will continue as private practitioners.

* One concerns the transfer of a social **security** pension to a Service pension, or vice versa.

* To make promises and plans for national welfare and growth while neglecting national **security** is an absurdity.

* An active and more independent role for Australia is seen as the best way in which Australia can advance its **security** in the changed circumstances of the 1970s.

* This authority would book shipping, negotiate freights, set up two or three licensed agents in the United Kingdom, organise and unify marketing procedures, upgrade selling techniques, speak with one voice in seeking out new markets throughout the world and give growers a new sense of **security**, protection and leadership.

* I do not know what the answer is and I suppose most people in the community - large employers and so on - do not know what the answers are: but one of them is the working conditions; another is **security**; another is the actual salary or wage involved.

* Perhaps Government members do not realise or subscribe to the view that we need a defence and **security** measure.

* Why would they not welcome this proposition because their constituents could get some cover and have the opportunity to feel some **security**?

* Since the Bill was introduced the Minister has indicated that the Australian Government has decided to emphasise support for welfare pro jects proposed by local communities under the assistance plan rather than to proceed with welfare centres operated by the Department of Social **Security**.

* If one really wanted to say what was the best that could be done to advance the interest of the Australian **security** industry in the capital market one would have to say: 'Make it publicly accountable in this way and avoid the criticism that is continually directed at it'.

* Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Social **Security**, in answer to a question a little while ago about pensions, referred to what was obviously a report in the 'Australian Financial Review' last week of an interview with me concerning social welfare.

* Secondly, the noteholder's right to exercise the option is not deferred longer than 24 months after the date of issue of the **security**.

* What response is made in these measures to accommodate the criticism that at least 800,000 social **security** beneficiaries will be excluded from bulk billing?

* How much more convenient would it be for them to be able to go into one building and find in that building the offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Department of Social **Security**, the Federal members' rooms, the divisional returning officer and Telecom.

* 70- Social **Security** (Seafarers), 1946, which Australia supported,  (i)  No.

* In addition 46 per cent of social **security** payments goes to the rural areas of Australia.

* From there he went to the War Service Homes Division but they told him the land he held was not large enough to provide **security** for a loan, and so he did not qualify under the War Service Homes Act.

* The General Assembly of the United Nations in 1957 voted to admit South Vietnam, only to be confronted with the veto of the Soviet Union in the **Security** Council.

* So many of us are so far away from our school days that we have forgotten what a scary time it can be between 17 and 18 years of age faced with the prospect of going out into the world, having to start a new job, a new life, a new career away from the **security** of family and parents, having to perform in a quite different way from the way we performed at school.

* In a condition of full employment this is understandable but at the same time I am aware of the fact that under different economic conditions it is quite conceivable that young men would be grateful to have guaranteed **security** for a considerable period.

* The group will be assisted' by officials from other departments including Treasury, Finance, Health, Social **Security**, Environment, Housing and Community Development and the Public Service Board.

* In this regard short term palliatives will provide no substantial **security** for the woolgrower.

* Borrowings are based mainly on the **security** available and are not, as a rule, available for payment of income tax.

* They have been told that on important matters such as social **security** they are allowed three speakers.

* Any money spent in guaranteeing their future **security** should be considered as an extremely worthwhile investment for Australia.

* It will give them **security** and it will give them a living standard on a par with civilians with regard to housing costs and conditions.

* It has brought about full employment and **security**.

* We want to know what time the **security** guards started to do battle with the fire?

* With respect to the other aspects of the question asked by the honourable member, I shall be pleased to convey the substance of them to the Minister for Social **Security** so that she will be fully informed on the issues that are concerning the honourable gentlemen.

* We place an emphasis on saving for **security** in the future and we are concerned with our future needs.

* I know that many aged people in my electorate are nonplussed by the attitude of this Government and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  towards them.

* I refer to the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of Health and other departments which have been increasing their benefits and payments to people who really need assistance.

* In March this year the Minister for Social **Security** wrote to doctors requesting that they continue bulk billing for pensioner patients and undertake to give pensioners the option of having benefits assigned to doctors.

* The airport patrol and **security** costs $175,144, administration costs $126,440, electricity and gas charges total $267,873 and local government rates and water charges come to $163,420 and so on.

* I am sure that those living in New South Wales will appreciate this to a far greater extent when they realise that they will have a continuing Liberal Government in that State to provide them with the **security** and a base from which they can continue to plan ahead and eventually own their own homes.

* Assuming that there may be wars in the future, planning is done in the expectation of one day having to fight a war, so regard must be had to the **security** situation.

* Those officers returned to Australia with 14 purified strains of blue tongue which are now stored in the high **security** laboratory at the Melbourne headquarters of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.

* If this is the best contribution that the present Minister for Social Services can make to the welfare of aged people it is a long, long way to that haven of **security** that they have all longed for.

* The appropriations for the child care program do not appear in the Budget Speech under 'Education' but under the functional classification of Social **Security** and Welfare'.

* Several years ago, when prices were, relatively speaking, very high, was the time when a stabilisation scheme should have been looked at to ensure the **security** of the industry when prices dropped at a later stage.

* Until the Opposition says what total savings will be made by those cuts every one in the community is entitled to assume that what it is proposing is an amount that will be either infinitesimal or else disastrously large to a point where people who have now become accustomed to receiving social **security** benefits and the kind of government support which I think they are now coming to expect, will no longer be able to get this support.

* The cases set out in that Article which seem most likely to be of practical significance are offences against the **security** of the state wishing to exercise jurisdiction, offences committed by or against a national of that state, and offences against the regulations in force in that state relating to the flight or manoeuvre of aircraft.

* This is evidence of a situation that is a far cry from the attitudes expressed by the Minister for Defence who has repeatedly stated that the Government would continue to spend more and more money each year on defence as a measure of long term **security**.

* We started today's proceedings with a complete abuse of question time with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  spending 22 minutes answering one question.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his address to the nation on Sunday, 1 6 February, stated: 
The second point 1 wish to make concerns another important part of our reserve forces, the Regular Army Reserve, and its significance in regard to our **security**.

* He said that the Government is ignoring health schemes, social **security** programs, welfare and so on.

* It has also been concerned to safeguard the interests of the staff concerned and the **security** of their employment.

* Although a decision is made which conflicts with the interests of the Australian community no-one can question that decision because it is made in the interests of such things as maximising profit and providing **security** for the business.

* Having in mind the establishment of a Government insurance office and the extended terms of reference of the Woodhouse Committee, especially the words 'together with the application of the scheme where death results from such sickness or defect', one wonders how open-ended the Government's intentions are in this area of social welfare and social **security**.

* There was less spent on health, social **security** and welfare in real terms.

* The purchase of these luxury planes for  Mr Malcolm  Frasermake no mistake, they are bought for him and nobody else because it was his decision not, as he would have us believe, a decision made by an independent **security** inquiry- epitomises the two characteristics which, after three years, have become outstanding of the Fraser Government.

* It shows for 1977 the total tax revenue, including social **security** contributions, as a percentage of gross domestic product.

* After 23 years of **security** a small number of Australians apparently forgot that in the Labor platform, with high priority, is the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange.

* Honourable members will realise, of course, that the figure of $ 192m does not reflect the total of Australian Government funds available to Aboriginals who are entitled to assistance available to other members of the Australian community by way of social **security** benefits, assistance under the National Employment and Training scheme and the Regional Employment Development scheme, Medibank and other schemes.

* One way in which Labor increased the size of the public sector was by substantially increasing the real value of pensions and other social **security** benefits.

* There has obviously been another serious leak from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I object to the Standing Orders being amended in order to provide the Prime Minister with **security** from attack from the rebels in the ranks of the Liberal Party at the expense of the public.

* Once it is accepted by the Parliament, with the support of those honourable members opposite who claim to be the representatives of rural industries, we will know that the legislation will be introduced before the middle of next yea: and that there will be brought to the industry the stability and **security** that it so greatly needs and for which it longs.

* Another group, which included the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Senator Cotton)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  considered that the Commonwealth should completely vacate the field and that the States should examine the possibilities of gradually reducing their death taxes with the view to eventual abolition.

* That gives an enormous degree of **security** to those big industries.

* I would have hoped that at the end of the 1960s we had succeeded in removing charity as the basis of health, welfare and social **security** in this country.

* We trust that the new domiciliary care benefit will not only assist people to meet the financial consequence of their dedication to sick friends or relatives but also help maintain that special sense of service, **security** and satisfaction which grows out of such dedication.

* We had been lulled into a false sense of **security** by reassuring reports that the increase would be much the same as in the previous quarter.

* European Australians who have sweated to carve out a nation from a desolate continent have a legitimate stake in this country and **security** of title to land is paramount in an orderly society.

* We had the same situation in regard to the threat to our **security** from Sukarno in Indonesia.

* If there has been the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has certainly not been doing its job and should be sacked.

* I also point out - and this is not without significance - that last night in this House in the course of the debate on the Social Services Bill honourable members who had been members of previous conservative governments until the last election and who are now in the Opposition were particularly vocal in their objections that this Government was being too generous in the provision of social **security** benefits.

* Tonight I would like to discuss a very important field of health care which has administrative and financial implications for 3 departments, the Departments of Health, Social **Security** and Repatriation.

* All pensioner tenants of these units are eligible for the supplementary assistance of $5 a week paid by the Department of Social **Security**.

* With social **security** the figure rises to 33.7c in the dollar.

* Thirdly, the Leader of the Opposition claims that the Budget produced no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** suggested that it was great generosity on the part of this Government to grant a $3 a week increase in the basic pension rate.

* It was with sincere regret that we heard the recent statement made in the Senate by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Wheeldon)  in which he announced, in response to the recommendations in the Coleman report, that the Government could not afford any significant reforms or developments in social welfare within the foreseeable future.

* The expenditure for this year for Aboriginal advancement is: Education, $4,600,000; health $9,il 34,000; social **security** and welfare, $3,230,000; housing and amenities, $14,786,000 - a total of $31,750,000.

* There are voluminous files in the Department of Social **Security** relating to this matter.

* They do this by consent for reasons of mutual **security**, mutual benefit and sometimes, but not always, mutual happiness.

* Do they mean they will cut the funds available for health care or do they mean that they will reduce in real terms the level of social **security** and other pensions?

* Total expenditure in the 1977-78 Budget on social **security** is $7,248m.

* As I said earlier, we are talking not just about the people on very low wages, but about the people over a whole range of wage levels- people who are concerned about their future **security**; people who have seen their living standards being whittled away over the last three or four years.

* This motive was related by the Minister to the Government's aim to ensure continued economic growth and full employment as well as to achieve and maintain national **security**.

* But be that as it may, what has emerged in recent times from the **security** and exchange inquiry in another place shows that there is need for a great deal of regulation in matters relating to the stock exchange.

* These people live in a situation where the telephone is their one means of defence and **security** - 
So, we have all the ingredients necessary to say that there is insolvency.

* The Opposition does not put this on a personal basis, but any member of this Parliament who is beholden to others because of debt or other liability may well have his judgment on matters such as national **security** legislation confined or restricted because of obligation to others.

* As the report shows, there were cases in relation to the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Social **Security** where expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer was confined to urgent and unforeseeable requirements for which provision could not have been made in the Appropriation Acts.

* I would like before leaving this subject of family allowances to draw attention to the fact that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and other Government spokesmen have said that they did not want this means testing of children's income to affect people whom they did not have in mind when they drew it up.

* I turn now to social **security** and in particular to the age pensioner 70 years and over.

* They should work out what appears to them to be a reasonable basis of safety and **security**, using the insurance principle as they would in other areas of insurance, and then take out the insurance cover that they believe to be necessary.

* If we had to introduce a means test there could be nothing more demeaning for people than going to offices of the Department of Social **Security** to fill out a form and declare themselves as disadvantaged.

* I also made reference to the very deleterious effect upon investments in this area caused by the unjustified spreading of rumours about the stability and financial **security** of one of the major New South Wales permanent building societies.

* But is the Labor Party and the country forgetful that when Japan entered the Second World War, we were living in **security**?

* The matters involve not only the ones which were raised by the honourable member in the Grievance Day debate and which I will not canvass any further but also the reply of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  who indicated that the facts that the honourable member for Mackellar intended to raise were correct.

* It becomes increasingly apparent, with the rising unemployment on a seasonal basis which we have seen again today in statistics that are to be released - 
Further, the 1977-78 figures in relation to the adjusted Hayden Budget figures show decreased support for education, health, social **security** and Aboriginal programs.

* This country depends very, very significantly, for its internal **security** and its economic welfare on international trade.

* We discussed the word in relation to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* If the Opposition is going to play with the **security** of men employed by companies, by the potential selective withdrawal of tariffs, and if it is going to change tariff policy and tell the Tariff Board what to do, it should expose this in detail.

* Allowing for taxation, including the health tax and social **security** payments such as family allowances, the net income of such a person when Labor went out of office averaged $1 1 1.64 a week; today it has fallen to $108.54 a week.

* It is only fair and sensible in the interests of the Australian community and the operators that **security** should exist for proper plans to be made well enough ahead.

* The figures for social **security** have been mentioned over and over again.

* The Department of Social **Security** has carried out a survey which has indicated that the amounts of subsidy that we are paying now will be sufficient, taken together with pension and supplementary assistance payments, to meet the cost of private nursing home fees and to allow $4 a week in spending money for patients in at least 70 per cent of nursing homes in Australia.

* The later annual report of the Department of Social **Security** at page 141 has a survey of age pensioners from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.

* This should be a separate function of the Court and not of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The practical producers in the pig industry when criticising the research programs say it is a fact of life that research has been channelled more into the short term to achieve noticeable results where people can see what has been achieved, rather than into the long term **security** of the industry and long term solutions to the economic and industry problems.

* It has come to my notice that at some stage last year the AttorneyGeneral's Department advised the Department of Social **Security** that the hospital agreements being drawn up with the States may not be in compliance with the Act passed through this Parliament.

* Yet every year that it has been in existence in this century no basic measures have been taken to remove some of this lack of **security**.

* It was felt that more oppropriate funding could be made to families who were in special need through our social **security** program and other measures which the Government was undertaking.

* I say to the honourable gentleman, not by way of levity but quite seriously, that **security** is not, as one would suspect, a matter which lends itself readily to objective criteria.

* It will be soundly defeated if it adheres to its  ad hoc  policies by which on some occasions it reduces a tariff and immediately there is unemployment it brings in temporary assistance for a short time and expects people to maintain their investment In the metal trades industry, the textile industry, the electronics industry or any other industry we see that there is no investment despite the investment allowance because there is no guarantee of **security** for the product here.

* They are not based on the priorities of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  or the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* Provided that the applicant for a grant has **security** of tenure of the land and the home meets the local authority's requirements for permanent habitation, the scheme is sufficiently flexible to encompass a wide variety of circumstances.

* 1 wished to refer to a number of other matters in relation to this Budget Speech but, as time is very short, I will content myself with a reference to those defence matters which I feel have been defined by the Prime Minister in this Budget as 'sustaining our conviction that the **security** of 
This House must consider the future of these schemes.

* I hope that honourable members on the Government side told them that they would support cut backs in the social **security** expenditure in the Budget.

* Each young person we encourage or perhaps do not discourage to take relief now, is promoted not to temporary **security** but to permanent instability because they may never feel the satisfaction of being self-sufficient and useful.

* There also has been a major development in the thinking of governments around the world on two counts, the first of which is the need to develop the maximum possible safety and **security** measures and safeguards.

* If we can move ahead with confidence in such a way that industrial unrest and the disruption created by a few people within the work force can be overcome, the average Australian working man will benefit by the confidence and the sense of **security** which this Government has brought to him.

* The non-government employee contributor has to contribute far in excess of 5 per cent of his income to have even a remote sense of **security** in old age.

* Australia, because of her close proximity to and special interest in the Indian Ocean, must provide leadership as we have always propounded the view - I heard this again put forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon - that we must maintain a presence in this region to ensure our **security**.

* That is, of course, when the working man begins to purchase new cars and consumer goods, and to save money for holidays and the future **security** of his home and retirement.

* A basic working document assessing the fine details and calibrations that must be made to introduce the scheme is being prepared by a planning committee working within the Department of Social **Security**, to which have been seconded some outside experts.

* What was the rip-off in share values in the last several years that brought that particular **security** down from $22 to about $7?

* Primary and secondary education, social **security**, health, housing, transport and everything else must be submitted to discussion and bargaining.

* It provides a focal point where social **security** officers can call and meet members of the community.

* Supporting parents, receipients of social **security** payments and their dependants and the unemployed do not qualify as pensioners.

* It claims that South Australia will get more water with greater **security**, there will be more water for New South Wales and Victoria and salinity will be greater at Chowilla in drought years than it will be at Dartmouth.

* It has built up a sense of false **security**.

* Because most Australian construction companies are short of capital and find difficulty in obtaining colateral **security** for bonding purposes.

* If we are spending large sums of money on defence- I do not deny it- and if that is an argument for the establishment of a committee, why not establish a standing committee of the Parliament on health, a standing committee of the Parliament on social **security** or a standing committee of the Parliament on education?

* No-one can tell me that she got the acceptance, the affection and the **security** in that white household that she received from that man sitting with her in the dust by his humpy.

* That in its turn was due to the fact that the present conservative Government chose to give directives to the trading banks that they were no longer to discount hire purchase contracts and associated promissory notes as **security**.

* You have sent **security** police into trade union offices, thieving the trade union office books and looking at them.

* One of the areas which is of prime importance to the defence of Sydney Harbour and to its **security** not only now but also as far as we can see into the future is the South Head installation.

* We must tighten up our **security** and our investigation in this field.

* Are social **security** payments to be stopped?

* The Australian Assistance Plan, directed by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  will gather greater momentum in the months ahead.

* I know that the Minister for Social **Security** is desperately trying to devise a means so that that present system in this regard can be maintained so that even under his health care scheme a woman will still be able to go to her own doctor.

* Some 20,000 power boats are registered in Western Australia, and their owners will be denied access to some 7 miles of safe anchorage and beaches and could be further denied an area of water up to, I think, a quarter of a mile, which is defined for **security** reasons around the Island.

* She is a widow for widow's pension purposes and, indeed, there may be more than that because the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  announced some time ago that he would give the widow's pension to the mothers of illegitimate children.

* He might think that that is too many but my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  has 556 deferred applications in his electorate.

* It would be a very proper thing for this Parliament now to see that such basic financial institutions as building societies are equated much more in their operations to banks - that is, we should guarantee their **security** and, in return, they should pursue the public interest in their lending policies.

* It was pointed out to the electors of Brunswick that letters were sent to both Scanlan and Hamer in August 1974 from both the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  requesting urgent discussions on the Medibank issue- urgent discussions, because  Mr Hamer  estimated it would require at least four and possibly six months hard work to gear the system for the introduction of Medibank by 1 July.

* What concerns us so deeply when we talk of appropriation is the massive- I believe it is at least $ 1.5m- splurge of taxpayers' money for advertising by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and his Department.

* The repatriation means test pension is now payable in overseas countries, just as is the social **security** pension.

* One of the most disappointing things to me- and I expressed this view when the corporations were established- is that the views of the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  were not followed when he suggested very seriously as a Minister of the Crown at the time that the **security** of tenure offered to employees of government ought to be examined in the development of statutory corporations.

* The Minister said that this Bill is a major advance and that it represents a new era of financial **security** for the patient.

* The war-time Joint Committee on Social **Security** is a notable example.

* This dominance of apples, coupled with the year-to-year variations in the proportion of apples sold at risk, tends to nullify the **security** or stability that this scheme is supposed to bring to the pear industry as well as to the apple industry.

* I hope that when the Assistant Minister replies he will give an undertaking that he will bring this matter before the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  who of course is well tucked away in the **security** of the Senate, away from the various members in this place, and make sure that this matter is discussed.

* In times of war it will also give us **security** to have our own petroleum supply.

* My concern this evening is to draw the attention of the Committee and of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr  Hayden) to waiting lists of old people who are seeking accommodation in modern, self-contained flats; of old people who need modern accommodation in hostels where the type of service provided takes account of their frailty and their declining ability to provide for themselves in all respects; of old people who need to go into modern, well-run nursing homes run by charitable and benevolent organisations on a non-profit basis where they can be provided with care and given the rehabilitation services to which many of them will respond.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was generous enough to say something in regard to this matter in the past.

* It can cover civil rights, environment, welfare, consumer protection, anti-trust, **security** law and the like.

* For example, the United States can make a grand gesture of reducing tariffs by 2 per cent across the board but it does not mean one damn thing because the United States has an iron clad series of guarantees for the **security** of its industries in the form of quota agreements which are controlled rigidly at the point of export in foreign countries or, if the governments of those countries are inefficient, at the point of arrival in the United States.

* The legislation provides greater **security** for the high percentage of chronically ill patients who are admitted to private or non-government nursing homes.

* How can there be any stability and sense of **security** in such an important and sensitive area as the armed Services when this sort of ministerial hurly-burly is in train?

* On 13 December the UN **Security** Council, then under the Presidency of the Australian Representative, extended until 15 June 1975 the mandate of the UN Peace Keeping Force and subsequently the Australian Government reaffirmed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations its willingness to maintain our contingent of civilian police as part of the peacekeeping force there.

* Our 2 society will suffer a deep and abiding wound and personal **security** gradually will disappear.

* There is no honourable member on this side of the House, every single one of whom is dedicated to the **security** of this country, who would not like to see and be guaranteed-

* Previous Liberal governments continuously improved Australia's social **security** program.

* '; and another one, who could very well be the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  saying: 'No private medicine!'.

* I believe in respect of some of these very expensive but also good proposals that the Government's own Priorities Review Staff should look at some of them to ascertain where this huge amount of money- the total of which for compensation, social **security** and health in respect of the new proposals amounts to 25 per cent of the Australian Government Budget- fits in with the Government's ability to pay and its priorities.

* Thus, agricultural societies usually have large families providing social **security** and sharing in production and consumption in a subsistence economy.

* I remember when I was Minister for Social **Security** that on more than one occasion, when it suited the private commercial nursing home people, patients were moved on litters out of their nursing homes to the edge of the footpaths of the streets outside the homes.

* Other important services include meals-on-wheels, subsidised under separate legislation also administered by the Department of Social **Security**, expenditure on which has increased by nearly 30 per cent in the last three years to an estimated $2.3m this financial year, and domiciliary nursing care programs, which involved Commonwealth expenditure last financial year of $ 10.7m.

* In other words, honourable members opposite try to get simultaneous elections to reduce the power of the Senate not because they really see the matter as urgent and not because the Constitution is inadequate but because they are intentionally trying to give to the Labor Government a **security** of tenure which its actions should deny it and which I am quite confident the Australian people equally will deny it the next time it goes to the polls.

* However, it must be seen that while social **security** legislation provides for retirement on pensions for males at 65, the compulsorily retired mine worker has his working life shortened by 5 years compared with other workers.

* If we set an example to underprivileged citizens and show that they can get away with crime if it is white collar crime, as we have allowed to happen in this country because of our failure to bring in reasonable **security** legislation- corporate crooks have been able to mulct citizens of millions of dollars while the Government sits idly by- is it any wonder that the armed aggressor will say: 'Well, I am going to get in for my chop as well'.

* It also has contributed significantly to the **security** of life in flood prone areas.

* It may be necessary for us to sacrifice a great deal of our **security** of investment in Australia in order to promote more Australian risk investment and perhaps thereby import fewer pieces of equipment from overseas that could be made here.

* Too often we have heard the heartless platitudes of Hawke, Carmichael, Halfpenny and others who quite apparently have grown up in an environment where those who supply the capital, take the risks, and create employment and **security** are to be opposed for the sake of opposing and to be pursued relentlessly with a devilish attitude of squeezing the last drops of juice out of private enterprise.

* The Bill, as it presently stands, will permit a Minister to deny the Ombudsman access to files and information only where the disclosure of such information and the furnishing of such files would, in the opinion of the Minister, prejudice the defence, **security** or international relations of Australia or might lead to a disclosure of Cabinet deliberations or Cabinet secrets or might preju-dice relations between the Federal Government and the State governments.

* If we wish the Territory to be developed and the Aborigines to gain from that development, which is their right and of which we all are in favour, there should be some arrangement in this Bill which will give people investing risk capital in the Territory-most of the money invested in the Territory is risk capitalsome confidence that they will have **security** of their leases, whether they be pastoral, mining or whatever.

* The sheltered workshop concept, which was conceived by devoted charity organisation and other organisations, has given a new hope, a new sense of confidence and **security** and a new lease of life to many of our handicapped people.

* Unless there was a conspiracy, what justification was there for  Senator Murphy's  raid on the Melbourne headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation?

* Having practised as a solicitor, trained to rely on the value of precedent in the common law, I am apprehensive of the false sense of **security** that this tradition could give to the fledgling politician.

* How the House must miss the former honourable member for Perth,  Mr Joe  Berinson, who was steeped in a genuine understanding of social welfare and social **security** matters and who worked assiduously to formulate Labor's policy in these areas which the honourable member for Perth had the temerity to disparage.

* This will severely restrict the flexibility of future governments to ensure job **security** in these and related industries.

* These procedures, devised to give **security** to and prevent political victimisation of public servants, have now been disregarded by the introduction of a stand-down clause whereby public servants with a contract of employment for a term of years can be stood down, without pay - the Minister used the expression 'no work no pay' and I suppose that is a bit of a vote winner - for a cause which may be beyond their control.

* In what manner the **security**, environmental safety and matters of that nature could be effectively protected.

* We can lay the blame for benefits being paid to bludgers firmly and squarely at the feet of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  because of the initiatives that he took as soon as he became the Minister- initiatives which had no result other than to encourage the growing-up in our society of a group of people whom I believe do not want to work.

* Of course, Tasmania will share in all social **security** benefits throughout the island.

* When I was discussing the matter with the Minister for Social **Security**, because of the increase of the subsidy from $2 to $ 1 to $4 for $ 1 and the lack of restrictions in meeting any rise in building costs the value of applications in the pipeline had risen to $270m.

* Many elderly people have received forms  from  the Department of Social **Security** in the past few weeks and they are causing confusion and concern to them.

* We on this side of the House have never suggested that it is not essential to maintain the defence forces in this country to guarantee our **security**.

* This stabilisation scheme which is being now so eagerly sought by the industry offers no panacea for the industry's ills but it will provide some measure of **security** to growers over the 5 years of the scheme and will enable them in that time to examine the problems of the industry in the light of the developing circumstances.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I will ask the Minister for Social **Security** to give me the latest figures on hospital services costs in New South Wales and I will post them to the honourable member.

* A lot of problems that are now dealt with by people from the Department of Social **Security** initially stem from the capacity and ability of people to earn money because of their lack of training 
These are unpleasant things, but a government which does not face up to an unpleasant reality will, I think, be betraying Australia.

* I am not putting this forward as something on behalf of my Party- I am not empowered or entitled to do that- but I think the best solution may well be 2 years in a labour force in the field and away from home for all Australian youth from now on until we get some kind of better international **security**.

* Grants for child care services for the remainder of this year will be announced and will continue to be announced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* Fancy the **security** police being turned on them.

* Because of the 26-year period since the last major involvement of Australia in war - that is, in a numerical sense - and because of our relative **security** at the moment there- is a, perhaps understandable, tendency for people to attach less importance than they have previously to the debt we undoubtedly owe to the members of our fighting forces - men and women, past and present.

* We can do this only if we have a responsible attitude to the **security** of this nation by maintaining our strong alliances with our allies and building up a defence service that will be capable of giving some protection to the Australian people if it is ever called upon to do so.

* This situation in which there is a lack of **security** in the Australian building industry is deplorable.

* -In speaking to the estimates for the Departments of Health, Repatriation and Compensation, and Social **Security** I want to direct my remarks to one aspect of our approach and the approach of many countries which have similar societies to the provision of social services, particularly towards the care of the aged in our community.

* My colleague the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi),  who I told the House, if the House did not already know, during my speech in the second reading debate is an expert in this field of insurance, is to be congratulated for the interest he has taken and the valuable work he has done in making sure that there is more **security** for policy holders, particularly in the general insurance field.

* Others would result from withdrawal of representatives of the Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial and Research Organisation, the Attorney-General's Department and the Departments of Education, Social **Security** and Veterans' Affairs.

* As he and honourable members are aware, sanctions voted by the **Security** Council are binding on all members of the United Nations.

* I am told that there has generally been an acceptance by law enforcement agencies that the finger-printing of passports would provide a very real **security** against persons being able to travel on passports other than their own.

* However, I think he may have been somewhat overcome by the fact that the Minister for Social **Security**, my colleague in the other place, made available $300,000 to child care workers in those refuges.

* But it is universal cover which is being instituted in a fashion far different from that in which it was instituted when the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  was Minister for Social **Security** in 1974.

* That would be the same AttorneyGeneral who, according to his Leader, was guilty of the greatest blunder ever committed by the Australian Labor Party, that is, the raiding of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation's headquarters in Canberra and Melbourne without good reason.

* Before proceeding to deal with those propositions I draw the attention of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to one respect in which I think the people of Australia would have been much .better informed if the Minister had followed a different practice.

* Then of course there have been all the huffings and puffings of the Treasurers- the official Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  not to mention the Prime Minister himself.

* Service pensions, which are analogous to social **security** age and invalid pensions, were increased as from 1 August 1974 and the main rates will not be altered again at this time.

* So I think that if any of the misgivings expressed in this regard apply to this Bill they should have applied all the more to the Bill brought down by my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I would like to see this trend arrested because it is not protecting us or giving us any **security** for the future in being able to meet our domestic needs.

* I am glad that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has done this.

* Probably the most serious threat to the **security** and safety of mankind today is the aggressive ideological advance of communism.

* The grounds for such a decision include prejudice to the **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth, the disclosure of Cabinet deliberations and such like.

* Can one imagine the gaggle of 
In **security** matters our closest relationship is with the United States of America, but that does not rule out participating in the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations, honouring our obligations to our partners in the Five-Power Arrangements, including Malaysia and Singapore, encouraging the development of Association of South East Asian nations and the concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South East Asia and engaging in defence co-operation with other countries in our region.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* With the utmost respect to the judges of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, it seems to me that it is most necessary to give them the **security** provided by this legislation.

* I ask the Prime Minister Has he and his Government not flouted the convention and the law on the following issues: In relation to open government, by his refusal to allow Parliament to know the amount of reduction in government expenditure; by not dismissing Cabinet Ministers for leaks or illegal actions, for example, the raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation; by his refusal to obey the rule of law by releasing national service defaulters contrary to the law; by violating the traditional convention of direct State appeals to the Privy Council - 
February of people seeking full time work was something like 54 000 less than is shown by the Commonwealth Employment Service's figures.

* As both the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said, we must be flexible and adopt appropriate measures for the times, and in the rather volatile world we live in we need to be very flexible.

* -The honourable gentleman will appreciate that in my position I am reluctant to expand too much on matters of **security**.

* The Department of Social **Security** has no way of re-activating claims which have already expired.

* Our problem in Australia now is one of sheer survival because the dream world of **security** which we once had is now gone, and I fear gone forever.

* The Government's decision to guarantee the continuation of the floor price scheme during 1977-78, at a level not below that set for the current year, has been welcomed not only in Australia but by the international wool industry as a means of providing **security** to woolgrowers and wool users in planning for wool production and wool usage and thus fostering greater stability in the industry.

* The gains at the upper end of the property scale will be great and an opportunity will be lost to collect, over the next few years, what will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, while the Government presses down on those people in the community who have no asset backing, no **security** and who for that reason live in fear of sickness and potential unemployment or any kind of major crisis.

* It worries me that, in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill, and this new Customs Bill to a much greater extent we are giving the Attorney-General the right to open the door to an area which previously was regarded as sacred and an invasion of privacy, that is, access to telephone conversations.

* I think the Minister would concede that, indeed, the quotas that were put on the industry were enormously important in bringing about stability and **security** in the industry and allowing the productivity increases to take place.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 4 May 1978: 
How many recipients of social **security** benefits had benefits cancelled as a result of the recent campaign by the Department of Social **Security** in February and March 1 978.

* They cannot do anything about it 'because we have a government that will remedy the state of affairs that they created and bring real justice, equality and social and economic **security** to the people of this country.

* There will be an opportunity during the debate on a health Bill that is to be brought in to cover the issues raised by the White Paper that has been presented, and all the contents of the White Paper will no doubt be under discussion when the legislation to be brought down by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is being debated.

* House of Representatives the **security** of the basic grant to every child attending a nongovernment school is preserved, as it should be.

* From a state of complete and utter distrust when no Japanese representative of that Government could visit Australia without some fear and trepidation, we have developed to the point where it remains in the national interests of both countries that our officials and our peoples be encouraged to come closer together so that we can not only overcome the sad legacy of the past but also together, and only together, build in South East Asia and in the Pacific a region of peace and **security** for us all.'

* The **security** provisions under Part IV of that Act, if anybody gets caught up under them, are enormous.

* I should point out, however, that Part Two of the Final Report of the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry, which was tabled in Parliament in March 1977 by the Minister for Social **Security**, contains proposals designed, inter alia, to enhance the effectiveness and fairness of occupational superannuation schemes and related schemes for the self-employed.

* But surely his interests in the national **security** of Australia are such that he can now recognise that that speech was a disaster and ought to be repudiated by all decent thinking people in Australia.

* The statistics do not differentiate between supplementary finance raised on the **security** of a second mortgage and other forms of borrowing.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
We were chided by the previous Government  speaker,  the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  for saying nothing about rural matters.

* **Security** in the Cabinet is at a minimum.

* Have investigations been carried out, into the **security** of information about overseas borrowings held by the Treasury, during 1975.

* must be judged by this one crucial test: What best promotes our national **security**, what best guarantees our national survival.

* The Government believes that judged on this standard, our engagement in Vietnam is right and that it does best promote our national **security**, and we believe that for these reasons:It is surely incontrovertible that in Vietnam aggression is taking place and is being resisted.

* Resistance to such aggression does best promote our national **security**, because we must strive to ensure that history is not repeated and that invasion and aggression is not allowed to be successful.

* That aggression was not successful and Australia's national **security** was best promoted because of that lack of success.

* And Australian national **security** was best promoted because it was defeated.

* I put it to the House that Australian **security** is bound up with seeing that aggression does not succeed.

* He said, as the honourable member for Barker expressed earlier, that he would see our defence forces designed to ensure our **security** and independence.

* If job **security** is guaranteed for workers already in the industry an expansion of the work force would mean more employment, not less.

* Firstly, I believe that there were problems of liaison with the Department of Social **Security**.

* However, I will refer the totality of the question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* This is not surprising as the three Liberal Budgets of 1976, 1977 and now in 1978 have had to be concerned with reducing inflation and interest rates and re-establishing a stable climate for individual **security** and business planning and investment.

* Does the Minister now acknowledge that the Government is failing in two areas, firstly, the building of homes for those in need and, secondly, job **security** for employees?

* It provided these sops in its amendments during the second reading debate, but then it offers Australian taxation and Australian social **security** benefits and now it wants to involve the Australian arbitration system.

* She rang the Chatswood office to find out whether we could repay some money which he borrowed from her without any **security**.

* My worry about the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is that it is politically naive.

* That is what our **security** service is doing.

* I urge the Government to have another look at the way the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is administered and to realise what a **security** service is for so that it protects the people of the country but does not prevent people who have legitimate grievances from expressing those grievances.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The second of six children, he is the son of a father who disappeared for a time at the birth of each new baby and who finally deserted the family permanently when Gregory was a small boy, leaving his wife and children destitute.

* His  mother,  from whom he seems to have inherited his sense of humour, was the one bright centre of **security** and warmth in his childhood.

* It is worth very much more to very many people, not only in terms of money but in terms of the **security** and assurance that these concessions give to the pensioner.

* To assist the promotion of greater regional **security** and co-operation in South East Asia and in the South Pacific, Australia is providing defence aid to a number of friendly neighbouring countries of immediate strategic interest to us.

* My colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**, throughout the last Parliament, and .myself throughout the Parliament before that, discussed this program very thoroughly with everyone who wanted to hear about it.

* This would not permit the Corporation to lend money to a party who needed it to discharge any charge, mortgage or other encumbrance entered into as a **security** for a loan raised from some private financial institution to buy land or to buy or build a house.

* One is that as members of Parliament we must all look at the **security** of our documents.

* We must look also at the **security** of our offices.

* When he was the Minister for Social **Security** the headline 'Blitz' soon to catch dole cheats' appeared in the  Sydney Morning Herald.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  wrote to members of Parliament some 6 to 8 months ago announcing that the Government was going to change its emphasis on child care services.

* This group, which is provided for in the proposals of the five Western members of the **Security** Council for a peaceful transition to majority rule in Namibia, would have civilian and military components.

* However, further details - 
Does that mean that the RSL should not complain when it sees members of the contemporary generation in dirty clothes, unkempt and with long matted hair, and that it should not complain of drug taking or of bludgers who refuse to work and instead get social **security** benefits?

* The Minister for Social **Security** wishes to make a personal explanation.

* I call the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Since the Commonwealth Secretary-General is in that area and on the day I asked the question the **Security** Council unanimously voted economic aid to Mozambique, and the Secretary-General expressed the hope that there would be a prompt, generous response to the Council 's appeal, I ask the Minister what response the Australian Government has made?

* (Mr Whitlam)  and even against the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)?

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said the other day that he thought it was about time profit-bashing stopped.

* We ought to have the Commonwealth Archives, the Commonwealth Broadcasting Commission and the Commonwealth **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Are Commonwealth car drivers required to have **security** clearances; if so, what is the nature and frequency of these **security** clearances.

* Our defence, our **security**, our health, and also the problem of drugs are all areas of concern in this regard.

* -My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The areas which are being covered by the Australian Government in terms of safeguards are the need to keep policy under constant review, a careful selection of eligible customers for uranium, the application of effective international atomic energy safeguards, bilateral agreements with customer countries, fall-back safeguards, prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing, constant physical **security**, safeguard provisions in contracts and international multi-lateral efforts to strengthen safeguards.

* In other words, throughout the defence areas and in the home bases we had very strong warnings that at all times **security** had to be protected.

* It was implicit in the question of the honourable member for Isaacs, that in view of the need for **security**, a careless remark in a debate such as this could well give information to the enemy which could affect not only the Task Force but also those of our allies who are still fighting there.

* The honourable member for Brisbane  (Mr Cross)  - I give him credit - said he did not think it right that some honourable members should ask for information that had **security** classification.

* Is it not reasonable **security** information to an enemy for it to learn that, for instance, the 1 1 5th- 
It is and has always been a principle in any warfare that withdrawal is the most difficult operation to undertake.

* It involves high **security**, even in an orderly withdrawal, not a retreat.

* During question time today I received some sort of unsatisfactory answer from the Minister for Social **Security**, about inaccuracies in the costing of the health scheme.

* 1971, the role and functions of the Special Branch, Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary were taken over by the Intelligence and **Security** Division of the Department of the Administrator, the Division having been created on 28th January 1971. 
by leave-Mr  Speaker,  in 1967 Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand met and established the Association of South East Asian Nations.

* The ASEAN countries have firmly held the ASEAN is not, and should not be, a **security** organisation or military pact.

* I stressed that the **security** of long term contracts as bankable documents should not be compromised in any way.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 4 April 1979: 
What happens on our side regrettably and reprehensibly on some occasions perhaps, certainly happens as a matter of set policy all the time with the Communists.

* Australia and Australia's existence and **security** are bound up with the holding back of Communism in South East Asia.

* Did  Mr Justice  Williams say that this power is one that expands or contracts according to the dangers to the **security** of Australia and that the power is peculiarly one with respect to which it is the duty of the High Court to be satisfied as to the facts?

* In December 1966 the **Security** Council made that decision.

* - Mr William Worth came to the Parliament as the interim **security** coordinator on 16 March 1978.

* He had the difficult task of bringing in the new and not always appreciated **security** measures decided upon by  Mr President  and me.

* He was for seven years the  Deputy  Secretary-General of the South East Asian 
I am grateful that he agreed to come out of retirement temporarily to take on the task of **security** co-ordinator on an interim basis.

* His  wide experience and quiet pursuit of the objective of a sound **security** system has been most helpful to me in my endeavour to provide a secure meeting place for the House of Representatives.

* Mr Worth,  by his personal character and quality, has been able to reach a situation in which everybody in the building is prepared to co-operate in the **security** system.

* Certain changes will be made during the break between now and February which will be designed to make more effective the **security** system in this House.

* Before asking my question I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**, who is sitting at the table this morning.

* In accordance with its banking charter the Development Bank would have regard primarily to the prospects, of the applicant becoming, or continuing to be, successful rather than the value of the **security** available.

* Those of us who have studied administration and industry know that in a situation of entrenched job **security**, especially at managerial level but really at all levels, there is no great incentive to make that extra effort to provide service to get the custom and efficiency and to keep costs down.

* The Government of Israel has no alternative but to remove the source of the terrorism which damages the **security** and wellbeing of its people.

* I was assured by senior officials of the Department of Social **Security** who worked with me when I was the Minister for Social **Security**- these are people with a very long term experience of administering health insurance- that many of the small private hospitals were nothing more than surgical mills pushing people through on the quick turnover basis for these quick elective procedural services like tonsillectomy, hysterectomy and so on.

* These are consumer protection, consumer credit, **security** markets and overseas controls.

* The committee covered aspects such as **security** over goods, misleading advertising, minimum deposits, disclosure of interest rates and all the other pernicious aspects of consumer credit that so deserve legislation.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security**: Is it a fact that under the proposed national health insurance scheme many people who prefer private hospitalisation, and now are insured for private hospitalisation in private hospitals and nursing homes, may be unable to afford the extra cost involved under the proposed plan and therefore will have no alternative but to accept public ward accommodation when it can be made available?

* That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of an onshore high **security** animal quarantine station, Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

* To ensure complete disease **security** from the mainland, the Committee confirms the selection of the site on West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

* I hope, speaking in a general way, that this will continue to be our approach in the Australian society, but the position regarding the Rhodesian Information Centre does raise additional questions because of the existence of **Security** Council resolutions which we have supported and faithfully observed.

* When dealing with anything which might be said to be coming from Southern Rhodesia it must always be considered whether the **Security** Council resolutions are concerned.

* The House will be aware that following on the **Security** Council resolutions we did amend our regulations in order to carry out our obligations under those resolutions of the **Security** Council.

* The Homeless Persons Assistance Bill arose through the interested commitment of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who moved very quickly after taking over his portfolio to set up research into vagrants or homeless men.

* But the interesting point is that he always returned to the same local police station so that, even though homeless, his **security** was always associated with the cycle of the police station, a bath, food, Pentridge and a roof over his head.

* He was run down by a car when staggering across to his only **security**, the local police station.

* It means job **security** to women at a time when child rearing is occupying less time of women's lives on a full-time basis and is frequently combined with careers.

* They have poured out blood, sweat and tears in order to keep their farms going and to seek **security**.

* This heavy capital commitment by Australia surely reflects the sincere wish of this Liberal Government to assume all its responsibilities in the South East Asian area, whether they be matters of **security**, education, commerce or finance.

* Of course there will probably, regrettably, always be a need for some sort of high **security** restraint to protect society from the compulsive criminal offenders - the recidivists, particularly those who show tendencies to violence.

* Its members should not hide like cowards behind the cloak of parliamentary privilege impugning other people's characters with **security**, but step outside and say it publicily if they wish.

* In the case of carry on finance, some were share farmers who did not have the support of the registered proprietor of the farm in Victoria to offer **security** for such finance.

* They have by means of" jazzy advertisements sought to lull people into a false sense of **security**.

* I do not think anybody in Australia would believe that a person in receipt of a social **security** pension of any type and who would have already had to meet a means test to qualify for a pension, would fail in the means test for legal aid.

* I raise a matter with which the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who represents the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  might be able to deal.

* The Minister for Productivity  (Mr Macphee)  goes to his seminars day after day armed with all the contemporary attitudes about employer-employee relationships, about worker participation, about profit sharing, about information sharing to ensure that employees can be guaranteed **security** in a stable industry and all the rest of it.

* The Prime Minister will recall that in his reply the Minister for Defence stated that the decision of the Government to purchase, rather extravagantly, Boeing 707 aircraft largely for the Prime Minister's use was based on **security** considerations.

* The **Security** Council is different.

* Australia's national interest is best served by recognising that we are living in an increasingly interdependent world - interdependent in terms of peace and **security**, in terms of human well-being and prosperity - a world in which Australia could and should make a substantial contribution.

* In particular, they found that quarantine **security** had not in any way been impaired by the decision of the Director of Health in Western Australia - a medical officer with long experience in quarantine work  -  to reserve to himself the authority to order the fumigation of vessels.

* The procedures were thorough and entirely in accord with recommendations made as late as 1972 by the World Health Organisation and were consistent with our high standards of quarantine **security**.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
 I extend the warmest congratulations to the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  for his eloquent and scholarly exposition on the wheat industry at this time.

* Being the first  speaker  to follow him I. would like, on behalf of all honourable members, to extend warmest congratulations, f also want to commend his concern for the economic **security** of the wool grower.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Exception has been taken that the amendment moved by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is not in conformity with an addendum or addition to the motion moved by the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth).

* Proper understanding between Australia and Japan is of enormous importance to peace and **security** in the Asian-Pacific region.

* That means that the resources to house them, to give them jobs, to provide their children with education and to provide **security** to the older sections of the family who ought to have proper reunion rights must be made available to those people, hopefully in family units.

* The social **security** cheques of those in the bush are being cashed and they are living on a diet of some food but mostly grog.

* He says that it would be a much more effective contribution, both to the development of the third world countries and to our own **security**, if we were to concentrate on developing friendly relations with those countries.

* I have written to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on this matter.

* During his absence the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  is acting as Minister for Health and will represent the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in this chamber.

* However, I do wish to say that it is my very firm view that on a Bill of this magnitude, which does encompass some quite wide sweeping changes to the **security** organisation in Australia, it should be open to the public to put views before the Parliament before the Bill becomes law.

* His  Government achieved remarkable improvement in the living standards of the people of the Republic of Korea while shouldering a major defence burden, to provide **security** in the face of serious external threat.

* This was conveyed personally to the Republic of Korea 
In the few minutes that are left to me this evening I should tike to say something under the heading of the estimates for the Department of Social **Security**.

* and (3) Rhodesians currently seeking to settle in Australia must be persons not excluded from consideration by reason ofthe United Nations **Security** Council Resolution of 29 May 1968.

* The **Security** Council met some days after that resolution was tabled and its decision reiterated a number of features which were included also in the General Assembly's resolution.

* Of course, it must not be forgotten that Australia is not currently a member of the **Security** Council.

* The main points in that statement- renewal of the mandate of  Mr 
Wingspeare Guicciardi, withdrawal of Indonesian forces and a genuine act of selfdetermination were later embodied in the resolution finally adopted by the **Security** Council.

* That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* I ask this question of the present Minister for Social **Security**.

* Did the present Treasurer, who we understand is to become the new Minister for Social **Security**, say on 21 May that the Government's intentions would be made known at the appropriate time?

* Trade organisations and agreements are well enough but without **security** there cannot be any trade.

* The core paragraph of the GovernorGeneral's Speech to which I address myself is where he so rightly points to the clear failure of existing social and economic structures to meet the needs of modern society, particularly in relation to education, social **security**, health, industrial relations and urban and regional development.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 14 September 1977: 
Did the Minister approve of the decision to remove trade .unions from the list of organisations and persons who receive gratis copies of the quarterly magazine of the Department of Social **Security**.

* A second reason is that proportionate to the population there are more nursing home beds available in Western Australia than in other States - (refer table 59 Annual Report of the DirectorGeneral of Social **Security** for 1972/73) and the occupancy rate of Western Australian nursing homes is generally lower than in other States.

* One of the most important things that this Government has done has been in the field of social **security**.

* We now see that the Government wants to impede the future **security** of Australians.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has been directed to resume contacts with the Bureau of State Securityknown as BOSS- which is the South African secret police organisation.

* The Minister for Social **Security**, who is a woman and is sympathetic said that fees would not be raised.

* They have no sense of **security** at all.

* I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  for.

* Because of the complexity of the system many do not register for social **security** payments.

* We all well know that Gough Whitlam achieved for Australia and for Australians some of the greatest social **security** benefits ever known in Australia.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is no, it is not a fact that the accounts of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation have not been audited.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Right now it is a genuine and valuable contribution to the **security** of Singapore and Malaysia.

* Why does the honourable member think that the meeting of  President  Nixon and  Mr Chou  En-lai augers a period of peace in South East Asia so that Australia may withdraw and no longer trouble itself about the **security** of that area?

* This includes the cost for providing and furnishing booths at airports, overtime, travelling allowance for officers, **security** measures for handling moneys collected and salaries of an additional 46 staff.

* It will add a very considerable amount to the **security** of Australia in the future.

* that if they want to continue to live iri a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, in a country which is free from racial strife, in a country which provides incentives for those who are prepared to work and in a country which offers **security** to its citizens, they can ensure this by working for and voting for the return of this Liberal-Country Party Government which has served them so well over the past 23 years.

* The instrument also caters for co-operative societies other than credit unions which are registered or incorporated under laws relating to co-operative, industrial or provident societies and which lend to their members on mortgage **security**.

* I present the following paper: 
I did note the reports in the newspapers yesterday and accordingly took the opportunity of checking with the Department of Social **Security** to establish what were the facts.

* Japan obviously wishes to have an equity share, not ownership, in those key industries which it sees as vital to its **security** and sources of raw materials.

* The publications distributed to prospective migrants are: 'Australia' 'Assisted Passages to Australia ' 'Your Journey to Australia ' 'Customs and Quarantine in Australia' ' Migrant Accommodation in Australia ' 'Employment in Australia' ' Housing in Australia ' ' Education in Australia ' 'Health and Social **Security** in Australia' ' Wages, Prices and Taxes in Australia ' ' Health Insurance in Australia ' 
-Has the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** been drawn to the behaviour of the Hospitals Contribution Fund of New South Wales, to which my attention has been drawn, that when subscribers seek to renew their subscriptions for the medical part of the Hospitals Contribution Fund until 1 July, when Medibank comes into force, and for the hospital part for 3 months, because there is discount on that basis, they are unable to do so, because the Hospitals Contribution Fund insists on them paying subscriptions for the same period of time?

* Information of the observance of common or Scheduled fees is published in the annual reports of the Director-General of Social **Security** from 1972-73, and in those of the Director-General of Health prior to 1972-73.

* Thirdly, it agreed that the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Social **Security** should draw up a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the Australian Greek Welfare Society setting out the basis of the provision of services by the Society for and on behalf of the Commonwealth.

* The agreement between the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments to sustain their close co-operation in defence matters and the joint affirmation of their intention to consult at the request of either about matters affecting their common **security** is not the less historic because so readily agreed, nor the less significant- for each and for others- because their friendship is already so firmly and so openly established.

* Wage and price restraint must be pursued because unrealistic increases in wages and prices, especially in those areas of manufacturing most subject to competition from imports, will threaten job **security**.

* When one walks into the Phillip medical centre immediately one has a sense of **security**.

* The Fraser Government's recent decision to direct all Department of Social **Security** investigators to concentrate on recipients of unemployment benefit is the latest of a series of contemptible measures to solve by deceit Australia's crippling unemployment problems.

* The  Northcote Leader  of 1 9 September carries a story which has the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  suggesting that claims that changes in the subsidy arrangements under the States Grants (Home Care) Act had reduced Commonwealth funding for services to the aged could be discounted.

* Indeed, our Government was in advance of the United States in making statements to the effect that Communist China should be taken into the **Security** Council after its admission to the United Nations.

* The new provisions of the Bill seek to deter the activities of people who may prejudice the **security** and welfare of other countries.

* -When the debate on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill 1979 was adjourned some four weeks ago, this chamber was debating the amendment moved by the Opposition that the words 'or hatred' be eliminated from clause 5(1) (c).

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr Anthony)  on the Bill.

* The fringe bankers do not care as long as they have sufficient **security** to cover the indebtedness.

* Is he aware that these people are not eligible for any grants or social **security** payments to help them in their losses?

* As well as providing handicapped people with the opportunity to augment their social **security** benefits, sheltered workshops perform what are perhaps the even more important functions of providing a social environment away from their homes or hostels and preparing handicapped people for employment in outside industry.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 May 1978: 
Where money like that is flowing through a loophole it means that governments have that much less to spend on worthwhile social **security** programs or other worthwhile government expenditure programs or it means that other taxpayers are obliged to pay that much more.

* Is he aware that some of these left wing influences have multinational associations and are actively opposed to the **security** and living standards of Australia?

* In 1957, on Malayan independence, Tun Razak became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence and National **Security**.

* In determining whether to provide finance, the Development Bank will continue to have regard primarily to the prospects of the operations becoming, or continuing to be, successful and will not necessarily have regard to the value of the relevant **security**.

* Has the Minister consulted with the Minister for Social **Security** on what use may be made of the survey.

* It should be noted that these figures are not comparable with the CES series because of differences between the boundaries of regions as defined by the Department of Social **Security** and of those used by the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* By building more homes we will give old people a greater sense of **security**.

* Health benefits and other items within the social welfare field also give them **security** and this is what they need.

* Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Bill provides the framework under which this may be accomplished and gives effect to the recommendations of a report on the future employment **security** of overseas officers in the Public Service.

* The report on employment **security** arrangements sprang from an independent inquiry into the employment **security** of overseas officers and the provision of future staff by Australia.

* The Bill provides for the prescribing by regulation of the terms and conditions of service and the superannuation, retirement and employment **security** benefits of the overseas officers who will make up the staffing assistance group.

* Other changes recommended by  Mr Simpson  relate to employment **security** arrangements for employees in the staffing assistance group.

* Modifications will be made to the employment **security** scheme for permanent overseas officers to update its benefits in line with rising costs since 1966 and to provide officers with certain options as to pensions, compensation or alternative employment on premature termination of their careers.

* In so far as superannuation, retirement and employement **security** benefits are concerned the Bill continues certain provisions in the existing Papua New Guinea law and preserves the continuity of pensions and the rights of contributors.

* But at the same time we are talking about spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new aircraft, new ships and all the rest of it although honourable members opposite say they believe there is no threat in the foreseeable future, no possible threat to the **security** of this country in a military sense.

* I commend the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who has instituted an initial scheme to allow leisure facilities to be used for day care for the aged, and some other schemes that she is bringing in.

* Welcome as it is, desirable as it must be and needing all the support we can give it, the proposal of the five western members of the **Security** Council is to ensure that conditions are established to allow an impartial electoral process leading to free and fair elections and independence.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
This Government is in a position where it will be responsible for making the decisions which will shape the economic future of the nation.

* These are very great responsibilities, probably second only to the defence and the **security** of the country.

* One test of our worth will be our tariff policy, (t has taken many years of dedication and hard work, particularly by my colleague the honourable member for 
Has the Minister for Social **Security** seen a report of a statement by  Mr Justin  Fleming, the  President  of the Australian Association of Surgeons, in which he associated himself or expressed agreement of his association with the Liberal Party spokesman on health and social welfare, the honourable member for Hotham, who had accused doctors' organisations of deplorable taste in their attacks on the Federal Government's proposed national health scheme?

* The Opposition agrees with the exceptions, particularly with regard to the arrangements for pensions and the exemption of employment **security** scheme payments.

* It has contributed to national **security** and has provided the economy with a diversified base.

* I will go and see  Mr Whitlam  now and I will not tell him that Reuben refused to see him and will tell him that it will get better results if he sees you for **security** reasons since Reuben's home is so well known in Vaucluse.

* If they do not obviously the **security** of this nation could be very much at risk.

* The proposals before the House brought forward by the Government deserve the support of the House in seeking to provide safeguards for Australia's development of uranium and protection and **security** in the handling of that material.

* The Attorney-General had to ensure the complete co-operation with and between the various **security** and law enforcement agencies under his authority.

* Mr Speaker, perhaps this would be a good opportunity for one to remind the House that, on 3rd April, the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  asked me to table the terms and conditions of appointment of the Director-General of **Security**.

* I can tell the House that  Mr Barbour  was appointed DirectorGeneral of **Security** on 22nd January 1970 by the Governor-General, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council for a term expiring on the day on which he attains the age of 60 years, subject to the terms and conditions set out in a separate determination.

* I therefore earnestly hope that an intensified effort can be mounted by our police and **security** authorities designed to expose and  render  ineffective the extremist groups who presumably are responsible for the attacks which have occurred.

* Did they insist that the previous Attorney-General take all possible action to stamp out terrorism and to ensure the vigilance and vigour of the law enforcement and **security** organisations?

* New Zealand has built a high **security** animal quarantine station.

* Australia is considering the establishment of a high **security** animal quarantine station.

* (a) Australia is also considering the establishment of a maximum **security** laboratory for animal diseases but this would not preclude the use of expertise in overseas laboratories such as the World Reference Centre for Foot and Mouth Disease in England which is about 24 hours distant from Sydney by air.

* It is not possible to predict when the station or the laboratory would be operative, both are in the investigational stage to ensure that detailed planning is as effective as possible to ensure disease agent **security**.

* It is for this reason that a high **security** animal quarantine station is under consideration.

* This Bill makes provision for a number of social **security** programs which give effect to the Government's desire to assist people to overcome hardship and insecurity in ways which ensure that they retain the maximum scope for independence and achievement.

* The Bill makes provision for the following: 
The Government has given a commitment to protect social **security** pensions from erosion by inflation through automatically adjusting pension levels each 6 months according to the movements in the consumer price index.

* The Government has given a commitment to ensure that the value of pensions will be preserved in order to provide **security** to people in receipt of them.

* I also ask: Who represents Australia on the study group on the **security** of maritime trade routes in the South Alantic and Indian oceans, and when does the Minister expect that the study group will make its report, which the Conference decided should be made through the SecretaryGeneral as soon as possible?

* I want to see the war service homes scheme, which T commend, extended because it is the right of every Australian to have the **security** of a home, and meeting the cost involved in obtaining that home should not be a drudgery.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said earlier this year that, if the rate of growth in average weekly earnings of 11.3 per cent did not abate, the Government would increase the promised increase of SI.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  flirted with the Australian public and fell victim to a little encouragement.

* At the last hearing of the one-man fees tribunal- that is,  Mr Macintosh-  set up by the previous Minister for Social **Security**, now the Treasurer, the doctors were awarded a fee increase of 4.2 per cent.

* It was thrust upon us by the previous Minister for Social **Security**, the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden).

* The unions always have always opposed adult apprenticeships for reasons related to job **security**.

* Look at the question of social **security** and the need for some effective legal representation in this area.

* Also, it is pointed out in the comments on the Department of Social **Security**: 
It is having the effect of reducing the inflation rate, and reducing it amazingly compared with the way in which it went up while you were in office.

* The cost of increasing pensions and benefits for Social **Security** pensioners and beneficiaries in November is estimated to be $140m in 1977-78 and $2 14m in a full year.

* If they are to grow into adults willing and able to contribute to society, **security** and stability are essential.

* The Government and the Minister also will be consulting under the terms of the special leases for Aurukun and Mornington Island which are designed to safeguard traditional occupancy and use and to provide the communities with **security** of tenure, which was so sorely needed and which is so important to the communities.

* I refer to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill and associated Bills.

* The Bill also provides for a widening of the definition of 'holding' in the War Service Homes Act, which will enable certain interests in land, not presently provided for in the Act, to be accepted as **security** for a war service homes loan.

* I hope that those honourable members on the Government side who wear their RSL badges with pride will at least vote with us to support our amendment seeking to increase the value of the war service homes loan to $15,000 so that the people in New South Wales to whom I have referred - and New South Wales is the most populous State of the Commonwealth - will be not only assisted to obtain a home but will be able to acquire a dwelling and so live with some **security**.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 April 1979: 
I want to make only one or two remarks on this matter.

* At a time when it has rejected a proposition on the motion for the second reading of the Bill relating to the dates from which these schemes would apply, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in another place is announcing that she will be studying the incomes of pensioners for the last 12 months to see what impositions can be made on their incomes of $49 a week in order, I presume, to recoup to the Government some of the $500m-odd that it could have lost and some of the money that it will have lost from tax evasion schemes which will date only from the time that the Government finds them so big that they become embarrassing, not from the start of the financial year.

* The Prime Minister's implication in answer to a question in the House today that the people of Australia would not believe that events in SouthEast Asia have any **security** significance for this country is one that the people of Australia will not accept.

* He continues with the view that for 1 5 years there is going to be stability and **security** and a matter of no concern for Australia.

* Honourable members will recall that Australia welcomed through a statement of the Prime Minister, joined as I recall by the Leader of the Opposition, the two agreements signed after the Camp David meeting as a constructive framework for resolution of the Middle East conflict based on the provisions and principles of the United Nations **Security** Council Resolution 242 and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

* Did the Minister for Social **Security** tell the Prime Minister before the Prime Minister's election speech that about $500m would be needed from Consolidated Revenue to finance the health scheme in its first year of operation?

* Indeed, as part and parcel of this should go a decision of this Government to provide a reasonable employment **security** scheme to those people who are surplus to requirements.

* It is time we welded this in with a proper employment **security** scheme for those Australians who now have to return to this country.

* The Government accepts this recommendation and the departments concerned will explore this with the Council and local residents with a view to making appropriate arrangements for public access subject to resolution of liability risks and to maintenance of **security** of the complex.

* It will jeopardise the **security** of those employed in insecure jobs for the sake of benefiting those in a particular form of secure employment.

* For that reason- and I want to make this quite clear-I would be quite happy to get a **security** clearance provided that, if there was any suggestion that I did not qualify, I would want to know why.

* Otherwise the authorities would say: 'Sorry; he does not get a **security** clearance'.

* The record continues: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
That was stated in a Press release concerning the Bill that the 2 honourable members intended to bring forward.

* The Bill as designed and presented to this House is diametrically opposed to that objective, as it would offer a feeling of **security**, to young people particularly, that if a pregnancy occurred an abortion would be available and consequently encourage rather than discourage unwanted pregnancies.

* What happened to the **security** service?

* Checks are also made by the Department of Social **Security** with a view to limiting the Government's payments to medical services which are reasonably necessary for the patient's care.

* We on this side of the House know that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is searching the world for an alternative national health insurance scheme.

* At present a **security** road serves Woomera but it cannot be used by the public.

* The Department of Social **Security**, the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Divisional Returning Officer and myself are housed in rented premises at various locations in Glenroy.

* The argument that Qantas cannot provide adequate **security** for a Prime Minister is a specious argument and false.

* 1 believe it is important that at the very commencement of the proceedings it should be the duty of any judge, if he were satisfied that even the slightest possibility of reconciliation existed, to forthwith bring into operation the relevant section, as a good, permanent marriage and the **security** and the welfare of the children thereof is paramount to the wellbeing of any State.

* The existing systems which provide monetary benefits to those who suffer incapacity as a result of personal injury or who are dependent on or related to a person killed as a result of personal injury include common law, including fatal accidents legislation, workers' compensation, no-fault motor accident compensation, criminal injuries compensation, air accidents liability, social **security**, superannuation, sick leave and private loss insurance.

* The possible occurrence of frauds of this kind was one of the reasons why the Government established the Myers inquiry to look into all aspects of policy and administration concerning unemployment benefit but, notwithstanding the results of that inquiry, my Department is already co-operating with the Department of Social **Security** to tighten the procedures in this area in order to detect and reduce the possibility of abuses of the kind mentioned by the honourable member.

* This is a genuine offer ... to give **security** to the many people .

* In that time wages have increased and social **security** payments have increased despite the attitude of this Government.

* Under this Bill the concept of a public service with **security** of tenure for career officials will be preserved.

* To be fair, I think it should be said that at the level of general rhetoric it is a more sober and mature account of Australian foreign policy and of the wider aspects of national **security** than has been any previous statement made by a Liberal Foreign Minister.

* In the area of the community of nations I suggest, from my own experience in addressing the United Nations **Security** Council, that our credibility was decreased considerably by our failure to take a moral stand on the Timor question.

* Australia's present position threatens our own **security** interests.

* More generally, it is an essential part of Australia's **security** posture to work for general acceptance of international principles of national sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of neighbouring states- principles simply violated by the recent Indonesian action.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-The most important thing after the **security** of having a job is the **security** of having a home.

* I congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on the excellent job he has done in bringing forward this great reform which will be of lasting benefit to all Australians.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Leasehold rental is an annual levy payable to the Crown forever and it is - and this is the essence of the leasehold system - an inextinguishable source of revenue for the people of Australia.

* Land is the basis of all wealth and it is the trustee **security** par excellence.

* It is not that he does not get enough to live on: It is just that he has not the **security** that I think he should have.

* The Government recently accepted a recommendation by the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, set up by the Social Welfare Commission, that homes which have received, or are applying for, subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act be required to forward a copy of their rules to the Director-General of Social **Security** and that any rule which the Director-General considers to be repressive or contrary to normal civil liberty should be the subject of discussion with a view to amendment.

* The second is that property confers advantages on its owner independent of, and additional to, the income it yields: it serves as a reserve of spending power in emergencies and thus reduces the need to save out of income, it provides **security** for old age and heirs, it provides opportunities for reducing income tax liability by income-splitting, it gives the owner access to credit, it is a necessary condition of business enterprise, and it confers social status and prestige.

* I was not attracted to the proposition of an inflationadjusted **security**.

* The airline will also be required to satisfy the Treasurer that adequate and proper **security** is given to the Commonwealth over the 3 aircraft.

* Can the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** assure pensioners that they will not be disadvantaged by the new income test which will come into effect on 25 November, under which income received will be taken into account in calculating pensions instead of both property and income being combined as before?

* But it is even more unreasonable that the Department of Social **Security** should have refused to provide unemployment benefit for those stood down workers.

* The car plan in Australia at the moment is basically the umbrella- the protection and the sort of **security**- that the Labor Government gave the car industry.

* I trust that it will not be too long before the off-shore high **security** animal quarantine station on West Island in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is in operation.

* He has now received a letter from the Department of Social **Security** informing him that it is not going to increase his pension because he is in receipt of income in the form of a war pension, which exceeds the level at which he would be entitled to the automatic indexation of his pension for rises in the consumer price index.

* In view of the importance of this matter will the Minister give consideration to locating the EDP system underground for better **security**, as is done in the Department of Foreign Affairs?

* Such resources would be much better placed in those Department of Social **Security** offices in regions of high unemployment where the social **security** system is close to breaking down.

* Not that this is the fault of the officers of the Department of Social **Security**, who do a herculean task under most difficult conditions.

* In Bonython, unemployment has increased by 300 per cent since 1974, but the staff of the local Department of Social **Security** office has increased by only 33 per cent in the same period.

* Thirdly, let them urge their Ministers to support us in our call for putting more resources into social **security** so that the dreary queues may be shortened, the delays in payment removed and the unemployed served as Australian citizens should be served.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I will not table the document from which I quoted.

* As the AttorneyGeneral has already stated in the Senate, the document contains matters which concern the national **security**, and the advice to him is that the document should not be made public.

* I have given an assurance that I will withhold from the right honourable gentleman nothing in the **security** field at all.

* I believe the Leader of the Opposition is entitled to know anything he wants about the **security** of the country.

* I do not wish to state whether I accept the accuracy of the version given by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representative concerning the points put by the representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* On 3rd May 1970 windows were broken at Honeywell Pty Ltd and the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation by a breakaway group of May Day marchers.

* In the 'Australia Left Review' of August 1970  Mr J.  Mundey, the Federation's Secretary and member of the National Committee of the Australian Communist Party, is reported to have said: 
My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* As a responsible member of the United Nations, the Australian Government has an international obligation in relation to mandatory UN **Security** Council resolutions which are binding on alf member states.

* Social **security** programs have been shattered by the Government's own inflation as the report of the Henderson commission on poverty published only yesterday in this House pointed out quite clearly.

* Last week the representatives of the Supporting Fathers organisation waited upon the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* 1 ) and (2) The recommendations contained in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on Unemployment: Special Work Projects are under active consideration by the Government and will be fully considered, together with other issues involved in the Aboriginal unemployment problem, on the basis of advice from a working party of officials of the Departments of Employment and Industrial Relations, Social **Security** and Aboriginal Affairs which has been established to review the problems and make recommendations on employment and training programs.

* I will not abuse any privilege which you extend to me,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  to allow me to address a few remarks m this regard because I do regard it as extremely important at this point in time- I note that the Minister for Defence is present in the chamber- to assess the situation of the RAAF and in particular in respect of the **security** and surveillance of the State of Tasmania.

* I suggest that this continuing programme - and I stress the word 'continuing* which has an element of guarantee in it - of maintaining an army of adequate size, giving encouragement to the Citizen Military Forces, establishing adequate reserves subject to immediate call-up and providing a further reservoir in the community is an immeasureably superior system and gives immeasureably greater **security** to this country than rh; Opposition's system which as I read it is one of panic call-up in times of emergency and panic training to get men called up to adequate standards.

* To the credit of the previous Minister for Social **Security** in the Labor Government, the honourable member for Oxley, the previous Government amended the scheme as people on both sides of the House had suggested it should be amended to allow the transferability of bed entitlements from those who had qualified but did not want to take up hostel accommodation.

* I have read the cables and particularly the newspaper reports this morning relating to the meeting of the United Nations **Security** Council.

* I note that some of the countries represented in the United Nations **Security** Council said that the resolution was not a balanced presentation of the facts nor was it fair.

* In any defence and **security** assessment we must now accept the concept that forward defence is out and mainland strategy and the immense problems involved is the reality.

* So not only was the **security** of this country an unpopular matter to contemplate- no one likes to think of war and destruction- but patriotism itself was almost presented as something to be ashamed of.

* It is the duty of every member of this House to arouse his people to responsible defence and **security** alertness.

* The future defence and **security** of Australia could well depend on our relationship with certain countries and on developments in other potential trouble spots near and not so near to this country.

* One was the failure of the Government to provide programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.

* With this almost statutory order of spending, what is Australia getting from this Budget to assure national **security**?

* This is why the amendment condemning the Budget moved by the Leader of the Opposition emphasises the Government's failure to plan and programme for the high national objective of social **security**.. 
As I said when I first commenced to speak, not only did we deal with the questions of social objectives and the lack of the Government's foresight in planning in relation to these important matters, but we also spelt out the failure of the Government to plan in relation to the **security** of this country.

* Daughters of Australia, Church of Christ, Department of Social **Security**, Good Neighbour Council, Grail, Church of England, Homefield Aged Persons Home, Mackay and District Senior Citizing, Mackay and District Development Bureau, Mackay Home Help Services, Mater Hospital, Methodist Church, North Queensland Society for Crippled Children, One people of Australia League, Parents without Partners, Queensland Association of University Women, Queensland Bush Children Health Scheme, Right to Life Association, West Mckay Rotary Club, Mackay R.S.S.A.I.L.A., Seventh Day Adventists, Presbyterian Church, St Vincent de Paul, Young Women 's Christian Association.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I turn now to the other important feature of the Bill.

* Under the present law, the Commissioner may not extend the time for payment of duty except upon receipt of sufficient **security** for payment.

* The platform of the Australian Labor Party, on the basis of which this Government attained office, made clear that Labor's industrial policy places human rights and values first and provides for the development of full human dignity in the industrial sphere, lt emphasises the right of full employment; real economic justice; freedom and **security**; the right to work in just and favourable conditions; freedom from unemployment and freedom to choose employment.

* As members of the United Nations and as participants in cooperation in this region we, with others, such as Papua New Guinea, also share a concern for the development of the region, for co-operation, consultation and for the **security** and wellbeing of all in the region.

* In fact, it was only the other day in the Parliament that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  stated that some seven out of ten of the 5.7 million people in the Australian work force are not yet covered by superannuation, and that this is true of four out of five manual workers.

* I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Sydney  (Mr Les McMahon)  took note of my speech during the debate on social **security** a few days ago when I dealt with the question of aged persons and in particular with the problem of those persons who are at home looking after elderly parents, in some cases for many years.

* Because we are fortunate to live in this country, taking for granted all the benefits it has to offer - they are there every day - we do not think seriously enough about matters outside Australia which affect the safety and **security** of this country.

* On the other hand, the defence and **security** of this country also are important because without the **security** of this country our main benefit - our economic **security** - is in danger.

* I must confess that I am a little disappointed in the New South Wales newspaper, the 'Countryman', because it has not given as much emphasis to this matter of defence and **security** as I feel it should.

* These amendments, in addition to inserting extremely large monetary penalties for various offences against the Act by foreigners, also delete any reference to imprisonment as a penalty and provide, at clause 11, that property seized under the Act may be released on certain conditions, including conditions as to the giving of **security** for payment of the value of the property if it is forfeited and for the payment of relevant fines.

* This amendment ensures that the definition remains in line with corresponding definitions in social **security** and repatriation legislation.

* I do not think that is the largest amount of wastage, just as I do not believe that the number of people who may be receiving unjustifiably the unemployment benefit or any other social **security** benefits are the people in relation to whom the greatest wastage takes place.

* He said: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
In 1967 the Defence Force Protection Bill was passed.

* It is interesting to realise that no people have been charged under the amendments to the Crimes Act in its first 10 years of operation, even though it was found necessary to guillotine the Bill through the Parliament because it was so necessary for the national **security**.

* Turning to the field of social **security**, 1 can remember that prior to the Anglican Primate of Sydney disclosing the extent of the poverty that existed in that city, the former Government's only contention was that there was comparative poverty - that one person did not have as good a motor car as another person.

* Yet in the interim report which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  released yesterday, Professor Henderson tells us that one person in every ten in this great country lives in poverty.

* This Government, in introducing very positive social **security** measures, has set about helping these unfortunate people who are in this poverty bracket.

* Is he not aware of statements that I have made that I and my colleagues, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  -and the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  have under discussion the results of a report by a working party into special works projects.

* Western Australians have always been terribly concerned about **security**, principally because our iron ore and other primary exports go across the Indian Ocean.

* Japan aside, Australia is the only country to which the **security** implications of underdevelopment are of regional concern.

* A severe crisis in the Indonesian economy almost certainly would herald a period of political instability with obvious implications for Australian **security**.

* In the absence of a specific approach from the Government of the Republic of Vietnam invoking the Treaty, the question of a report to the **Security** Council has not arisen.

* I replied to the effect that it was not necessary to report to the **Security** Council, and 
The other thing I would say is that under the United Nations Charter Article 102 requires treaties and international agreements to be registered.

* The South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty does not require a report to the **Security** Council of requests received under Article 4 paragraph 3 under which we received the request although it does require a report of measures taken under paragraph I of Article 4, that is, measures taken to assist in defence against aggression where there is an armed attack in a treaty area, and in point of fact on 4th May 1965 a message was passed by the Australian Acting Permanent Representative of the United Nations,  Mr Dudley  McCarthy, to the  President  of the **Security** Council in compliance with that obligation which was not an obligation to report letters.

* Does he agree also that close co-operation between Australia and Indonesia is essential for the **security** and prosperity of the South East Asian region?

* Its aim should be that all our citizens may enjoy the **security** and peace of life that stems from the knowledge that in every eventuality the rights, well being and dignity of the frail, the sick and the aged will be upheld and properly safeguarded.

* When some of us explained to them that self-government was the control of every function of government except probably internal **security** and external defence they tended to believe that they were ready for that now.

* But if the Government extends its patronage at the expense of those who want it, it cannot expect the people on this side of the Parliament to support it because our policy is to support those in need and to give to them the money necessary to maintain their families in **security** and happiness in this age of inflation under Liberal-Country Party governments.

* But, of course, if an Australian resident places business with an unauthorised overseas company he must make his own judgment as to the **security** of the insurance which he places.

* I have a particular interest in the findings or results of the survey which will cover a wide area of particular interest to the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  stands in this House constantly and says that even though Queenslanders will have to pay this extra amount, it will mean about another $35m a year for the Queensland health scheme.

* The average employee's real earnings- that is, after tax- rose 7 per cent in 1974-75, or almost 10 per cent when the unrecorded benefits from education, health and social **security** are added.

* The original Act of 1951 in substance took over the National **Security** (Conscientious Objection) Regulations of 1942 which covered objection during World War II.

* It seems important too, for profit margins to be at a level sufficient to encourage investment which will strengthen business operations and enhance job **security**.

* I believe very strongly that unless we preserve the **security** of family life we will be stepping down from the standards which the pioneers of this country and other people have provided in the past.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I appreciate the sentiments of the honourable member for Mitchell that there is a need to have a specialist Minister because it is a specialist role and there is an on-going commitment in a highly technical and difficult arena.

* However, I think it is appropriate to remind the House and the people of Australia that because of the fact that we have encouraged home ownership in this country as against the policy and platform of the Australian Labor Party of encouraging home rental- it even has the temerity to suggest that we should have an imputed value on home ownership as far as rental is concerned- many of the people who are at present in the defence forces have, on account of **security**, cost containment and a deliberate emphasis in the area of home ownership, already obtained their own homes.

* The big problem today is that the Minister for Social **Security** has succeeded in getting public debate about the health scheme into the area of doctors' fees.

* Indeed, hardly any members of the Opposition were here to listen to their Leader when he made a speech on a most important matter affecting the **security** of the nation.

* The Prime Minister will remember with pleasure, I think, that on a David Frost show last year he said that the greatest disaster involving the Labor Government up to that time was the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation raids under the gallant leadership of the AttorneyGeneral.

* I am sure that this House will agree that there must be no argument that the most significant change in the social **security** benefits area has been the amalgamation of child and student endowment into a single family allowance.

* It is significant and important for the Australian community to realise that the total outlay on social **security** and welfare in this Budget has been increased from $5,0 12m in 1975-76 to $6, 187m in 1976-77.

* I think if one looks at the annual report of the Department of Social **Security** for 1975-76 we can see how this confusion arises.

* The report states: 
I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social **Security** and the Government for responding rapidly to the welfare needs of our community.

* I believe that they will mean significant improvements in social welfare and social **security** protection for the Australian people.

* The elections, even if they were free and fair, which they were not, failed to meet the objective criteria established by **Security** Council resolutions .

* I do not think international relations will prosper while that attitude is adopted by one of the significant countries of Africa- indeed, its largest country- a member of the **Security** Council, and one upon which we rely to prevent wars.

* The great difficulty with the **Security** Council at the moment is that those countries which are supposed to be preventing war are sponsoring it.

* I do not want to be unreasonable about this matter but I suggest that it would be scandalous if the Leader of the House forced this debate on next Wednesday - I understand that that may be his intention - so as to preclude honourable members on this side from speaking at a time when our proceedings are being broadcast to something like 20,000 people, in view of the fact that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has been not unpro vocative in some of the statements he has made about the Opposition and various aspects of this matter.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
It is absurd that only six members from each side of the House are permitted to speak on the expenditure of thousands of millions of dollars by three departments which, I am sure, are of the greatest concern to all honourable members in the pursuit of their constituency responsibilities.

* I think that, if we look at the lamentable record of the Fraser Government in the field of children's services since it decided not to proceed with the establishment of a children's commission and decided instead to establish a mere division within the Department of Social **Security**, we will see just how important institutions occasionally can be in flagging changes in government policies.

* When the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and her officers were taxed with this matter before the Senate Estimates Committee, neither the Minister nor the officers were able to produce meaningful figures for these expenditures.

* **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2) and (3) The published preliminary results of the 1974-75 Household Expenditure Survey, which was undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, do not contain separate expenditure details relating to age pensioners between the age of 65 and 69 years.

* But the burdens of collective **security** unfortunately are falling harder on some than on others and the people of the Republic of Vietnam have had more than their fair share to bear.

* the making of National **Security** Regulations and 'Subsequently the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance - relating to the recovery of possession of business premises.

* We have a tradition of stability; we have a tradition of positive commitment to the future political stability and economic **security** of South East Asian countries.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* They have nothing to do with national **security** or the Attorney-General.

* I have seen the draft schemes circulated from time to time by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Then there was the question of his dealings with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation which still has a very large note of interrogation hanging over it.

* This device was not under the supervision or jurisdiction of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* It appears to me that the position before the dissolution of a marriage with respect to the separation of the sort that is envisaged by the people arguing for this clause is no different from separation after marriage and that the same provisions of maintenance or, in the absence of maintenance, of social **security** benefits that are available after a divorce are also available in the case of separation prior to a divorce.

* As to my own position, I shall continue to accept the advice that I and my predecessors have accepted- that in the interests of **security** we should travel by Royal Australian Air Force aircraft.

* Is the right honourable gentleman aware that there is a vacancy for a counter pensions officer at the Prahan office of the Department of Social **Security** that services both my electorate and the electorate of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports?

* The Director-General of the Department of Social **Security**  Mr L.  J. Daniels today made available his Determination in the claim for unemployment benefit by Miss Karen Green.

* In a tug-of-war with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the Department of Social **Security** won out.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
However, it is not obvious that a judge should be appointed Ambassador-at-Large on nuclear matters or as Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, or a member of boards such as the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped.

* No responsible government in Australia could fail to be concerned by the immensity of the threat to Australia's and the region's **security** posed by the fighting now taking place in Kampuchea and hopefully now ending in Vietnam.

* In the New Zealand **security** legislation the word 'ultimately' is not used in relation to subversion.

* In order to allow a greater degree of flexibility and to enable changes in the amount of grants to be made more readily in the light of changing costs, it is proposed that the specific amounts detailed be deleted from the Act and provision made for the maximum amount of the grants to be determined by the Minister for Social **Security** in future.

* Honourable members will be interested to know that with the concurrence of the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  a working party of officers of the Departments of Social **Security** and Treasury has been looking into questions associated with the maximum subsidy limits such as methods of cushioning the increased building costs of projects approved prior to and since 1 April 1974 and the feasibility of introducing zone loadings in respect of projects in country areas.

* In order that these entitlements will not be wasted and to add further stimulus to the legislation, the Bill introduces a provision which will enable an organisation which does not intend to take advantage of its rights to transfer them in whole or in pan to another eligible organisation, subject to the approval of the Director-General of Social **Security**.

* -I direct to the Prime Minister a question which concerns the United Nations **Security** Council proposal to station 7,500 United Nations troops in Namibia during that country's transition to independence.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
When it projects all these decisions and alleges Federal cuts, clearly in the field of recurring grants the statements are quite untruthful.

* So they will have complete **security** of knowledge of what they are going to get through the academic year 1976.

* I can assure the honourable member and all honourable members- indeed, I can assure all pensioners- that social **security** pensioners and their beneficiaries will receive increases due to them from the first pay period in May.

* In the last week of April the Minister for Social **Security** will be advising all the pensioners and their beneficiaries of this change.

* Its basic value seems to be national **security**.

* This indicates that there has been a substantial redistribution of purchasing power to pensioners and social **security** beneficiaries under this Government.

* The Government is keenly aware of the problems and has decided to take yet another step to fill a gap in our social **security** system which should not have been allowed to continue.

* In order not to have rammed home the lie that the Prime Minister in fact perpetrated by describing the communication as a lie, he hides behind national **security** not to produce evidence.

* Food, shelter, **security** for old age, health, education, mental, cultural, spiritual and emotional fulfilment are the essential building blocks of our society.

* They have a sense of **security** and, above all, independence which is so essential to aged people.

* 1 think honourable members will recognise that our aged persons homes legislation not only has given happiness and **security** to the people who become residents under it, but also has taken a load off the remaining small fraction of the pensioner community which still rents its accommodation, because the construction of these aged persons homes and their occupation by pensioners has substantially reduced the pressure on other accommodation and has made this other accommodation available to other pensioners, under less crowded conditions or at a cheaper rate.

* The other document to which he refers is the document of 5th March by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representative at the interdepartmental committee meeting in Canberra.

* He said: 
The Opposition is very pleased that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has seen fit to co-operate with our suggestions, which were moved in the Senate and which we say will not only improve the machinery of the Bill but will also give further protection to the contributors to the Funds.

* I address a question to the Acting Prime Minister and refer to an article in the current issue of the 'National Times' wherein it is alleged that Australian **security** organisations took over some of the operations of the Central Intelligence Agency in Cambodia with the aim of de-stabilising the Government there in much the same way as the Government of Chile was recently de-stabilised.

* I believe the judgment of history wm confirm that on all momentous issues affecting the peace and **security** of our region China has been proved right and the Western nations paid a heavy and tragic price for their folly and short-sightedness.

* The strains will be further purified and stored in maximum **security** at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Victoria.

* The United States and Australia are agreed, as recorded in the ANZUS communique of 28 July, that any arms limitation agreement in the Indian Ocean between the two major powers must be balanced in its effects and consistent with Australian and United States **security** interests.

* Because the Aboriginal people are to receive, say, a million dollars in some sort of payment for the trespass upon their land and the threat to their social life and their **security** which flows from having mining communities next door, we intend to take back some portion of it- perhaps $100,000- to pay into Consolidated Revenue.

* In part of his speech he said that this introduces a new era of financial **security** for nursing home patients.

* -Will the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** say whether the Director-General of Social Services wrote to all State Directors of Social Services on 26 October 1977 about the payment of unemployment benefit in arrears?

* -I refer the Minister for National Development to the article in today's  Australian Financial Review  regarding a telex from Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd. Is the Minister satisfied with the **security** of his office?

* It was the spokesman on social **security** who was resisting and wanting to dismantle it.

* The need for the Government as a matter of urgency to make a statement on the plight of the people of South Vietnam in their courageous defence against the blatant invasion by North Vietnam and its serious implications for the **security** of Australia.

* A policeman cannot be covered presumably for the same reasons but a person who is doing policeman's work in the Metropolitan **Security** Service can be covered.

* The service will be further extended when the staff involved transfer to the Department of Social **Security**.

* Overall in the Department of Social **Security**, there would be a cut in expenditure of something like $280m.

* So, in fact, the policy of the Opposition in regard to social welfare represents a very severe cutback in the wideranging programs administered by the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Labor Party has storm troopers all around the country creating fictitious smokescreens but it has overlooked one thing, that is, the inherent character of the people of Australia and their determination to resist any move which threatens the **security** of their country.

* In the last few days, and other speakers have commented on this, we have had the picture of one Government member suggesting that there should be no social **security** benefits for unemployed persons under 25 years of age.

* -The facts are that on 23 March 1976, in a joint Press statement issued by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the Government announced that school leavers were not to be paid unemployment benefit in the school vacation period no matter how hard they tried to find employment and were unsuccessful.

* Despite repeated questions from the Opposition in the other place the Minister for Social **Security** has not been able to provide any figures on how  many school leavers had done this in previous years.

* So we have had the Minister for Social **Security** being challenged in the other place to produce statistics and we have had the Minister for Health stand up in this place today and go on with a lot of twaddle but produce no evidence whatsoever.

* This arbitrary and quite callous policy decision was implemented by the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security** during the long vacation.

* Section 7 of the Social Services Act binds the DirectorGeneral of Social Services to act on the direction of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** had directed that this policy be implemented.

* The community at large and school leavers in particular will be bearing down on the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Health in this respect.

* There was no way that the Minister for Social **Security** was going to allow the Director-General out of a straight jacket.

* Finally I should state that of my own knowledge we have now agreed to close relationships on a **security** and intelligence basis with the Indonesian authorities.

* In other words, as I said in a speech that I made in the House last week, we regard both Japan and Indonesia as countries that should receive the closest support in the Pacific theatre because they can make a real contribution to the **security** of the area, and they are both important from the  point  of view of the development of the economies of the Asian countries and the development of close relationships too.

* My question is to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The answers to questions (2), (3) and (4) have been provided by the Department of Social **Security**.

* All the children who have not been adopted are under the legal guardianship of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Under Section 6 of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, the Minister for Social **Security** is the legal guardian in Australia of children who come within the provisions of the Act.

* Indeed, some of the legislation introduced and decisions taken by the Government, such as increased social **security** and repatriation payments and the provision of the vote to 18-year-olds, are worthy of support; while some decisions on unilateral currency revaluation, foreign policy and industrial matters have concerned the nation, including many people who voted for the Labor Party at the last election.

* After probably 12 years of agitation by way of questions, deputations to Ministers and personal correspondence, I am gratified to know that employees at the Williamstown naval dockyards and the Government Aircraft Factory at Fishermen's Bend, Melbourne, if the programme set out in the defence statement made in this House is carried out in its entirety, will have some measure of job **security** in the next decade.

* That a section 82 (9A) be inserted to read: 'Where it is proposed to engage for employment under this section a person who is not a British subject, or a person who is a British subject but is also a national of another country, the Minister may, after a report from the Board and if it appears to him that the employment of that person would not be  prejudical  to the national **security**, the preservation of official secrecy of any other interest  of the Commonwealth, determine that the last preceding sub-section is not to apply in relation to the engagement of that person'.

* I hope that I am not treading on any corns that may emerge later when I say that I was particularly pleased by his suggestion that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation should not be under the control of the Prime Minister.

* I found it difficult to relate the honourable members comments about a police force to a **security** organisation.

* I would not in any way like to endorse his overall comments that the role of a **security** organisation is similar to the role of a police force.

* Whilst I think that it is better to have the matter in the hands of the Attorney-General because of his particular responsibility to the Parliament, I do not accept the reasoning of the honourable member for Prospect who compared the role of a directorgeneral of a **security** force to the role of the head of a police force.

* Finally, I am pleased that this debate had the constructive comments we heard from the honourable member for Isaacs,  (Mr Hamer),  because there has been a great deal of denigration of **security** organisations throughout the world.

* I believe that the world has been done a disservice by the people of the United States of America in the way in which their parliamentarians have played the role of the devil's advocate in relation to their own **security** organisations which have been brought into considerable disrepute.

* I have not seen in what has been revealed circumstances that really would lead me to have substantive doubts about their capacity as **security** organisations but I do have doubts about their capacity as organisations to function well in the defence of the free world.

* I am pleased that in this debate we have not heard the denigration of our **security** organisations but have seen demonstrated a preparedness on both sides to discuss the appointment of a judicial officer who will become the head of our organisation, a man who was appointed at the first instance by our opponents, the former Government, and in whose appointment we concur and are now proceeding with.

* I believe this is important because the **security** organisation works in our own interests as a country and it will work in our own and our best interests only if it has the confidence of the Australian people and if we can allow it to continue to function without it having to reveal what it is doing and the way in which it is undertaking its task, so destroying its capacity to undertake that task properly and in our own interests.

* The second and more important reason is that of **security**.

* Resettlement is a decision for individuals themselves to make and my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has been active in providing assistance in this regard.

* As the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  our shadow Minister for social **security** so adequately put it yesterday in the debate on the Social Services Bill, the Government has changed its course from aiming to provide as a base for pensions 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings to providing increases tied to percentage increases in the consumer price index.

* To our discredit we also have not introduced any measure to overcome this most unjust provision in our social **security** legislation that self-employed people are automatically deprived by regulation of any form of assistance through the welfare system and, in particular, unemployment benefits.

* The pensioner will be able to plan ahead with a greater degree of **security**.

* Because I have had a number of inquiries about this interpretation, the Minister for Social **Security** has given, in definition of the word, the example that a person may be genuinely unemployed and eligible for the unemployment benefit even though he spends a certain amount of time on odd jobs in his business.

* You advised at that meeting you would arrive in Australia between 1-5 October 1979 with Bank of America bank cheques to effect drawndown of these four loans (plus Jasch and one million loan) all totalling Aust dollars eight million against first mortgage **security**.

* You further requested- 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 1 April 1978: 
It would appear to be a true saying that 2 great minds think alike.

* It is one of the blackest periods because our Minister for Defence has decreed more and more defence cutbacks which sap our military strength and imperil the **security** of every Australian.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 May 1978: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war.

* Complete evaluation of the extent of the risk and assessment of what course should be followed to reduce it involve matters of national **security** and international relations which are beyond the ambit of the inquiry.

* Department of Social **Security**: North-eastern Corridor of Melbourne  (Question No.

* Belgium, Canada, Italy and Japan move in the United Nations for (a) reaffirmation of the principle that States shall refrain from use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State (b) the fullest possible use by parties to a legal dispute of (i) the World Court, (ii) the good offices of tbe Secretary-General, (iii) improved methods of fact-finding and conciliation, (iv) **Security** Council subsidiary organs for settling specific disputes and restraining the flow or arms towards tension areas, (c) equitably financed peace-keeping procedures and (d) total disarmament.

* We also understand the concern they have about **security**.

* Will the Minister for Social **Security** cause a searching inquiry to be made into the conduct of home unit organisations to ascertain the operation of the administration of such organisations where pensioners and other aged persons are required to pay substantial sums of money to gain admission?

* I assume that, on a matter as important as this, which involves such great complexity and is so vital to the **security** of the country, the Government would want to have a full and adequate debate at some stage.

* In speaking to the Health Insurance Commission Bill one speaks to a Bill which is described as one of a sextet produced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  - 2 being produced recently and 4 to be presented next year.

* Referring to the Health Insurance Bill - and I hope that in doing so I am not transgressing the procedures of the House - I would like the fact noted that the honourable members for Lilley  (Mr Doyle),  Bowman  (Mr Keogh),  Capricornia  (Dr Everingham- 
The preservation of the **security** of Australia as a free and democratic nation and the welfare of the Australian people, promoted through a sound economic policy with justice to all sections, are the paramount responsibilities of this national Parliament.

* My Department has already taken action in Sydney to reconcile the records kept by the Department of Social **Security** involving the issuing of unemployment benefit cheques with the records kept by the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* -The Commonwealth is indebted to  Mr Justice  Hope for his reports on intelligence and **security**.

* It has guaranteed job **security**- no retrenchments for 10 years.

* I am also advised that the Statutory Authorities for which I am responsible have made arrangements for the recycling of waste to the maximum degree practicable and consistent with the need for economic management and **security** of records.

* At least that is so since I have been Minister for Social **Security**.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** a question concerning his action in calling for tenders for 13 million registration cards in anticipation of his National Health Bill being passed by this Parliament.

* At the same time, within the province of the Department of Social **Security** and of the Director-General there is a capacity to use a discretion in relation to hardship.

* In fact the evidence so far is that Medibank has been cheaper than would have been the previous system of private health insurance on projections which were taken out by the Department of Social **Security**.

* So effectively there was a saving of $22m 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, 24 October 1979: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  when he was Acting Treasurer, went out of his way in this House to comment about resource allocation in Australia and what he thought should be done.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Many other people help us in this place.

* We are indebted to the way he assumed the role, out of retirement, of Principal **Security** Officer in the Parliament.

* I believe that the work that he has done has ensured that today there is a far greater degree of reasonable **security** in this place than otherwise would be the case.

* Since the House last met, the Attorney-General has twice visited the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Melbourne.

* They have embarked on an enterprise of great significance to the **security** of the whole area.

* What confidence do we engender by breaking up the 5-power defence arrangement and scrubbing the only **security** arrangement we have with" Thailand and the Philippines?

* To maximise the contribution of an expanded and socially acceptable nuclear program which is consistent with the maintenance of a safe environment in terms of solving problems of health and **security** which may arise.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  found it necessary to go to the Press about the export prices of north Queensland minerals, a situation which put him on a collision course with the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson).

* But I think that there are many advantages that a freehold title has, such as giving to the home owner a sense of **security**, that are not attributed to the form of tenure that is commonly described as leasehold.

* The Minister for Tourism and Recreation who acts in this place for the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Wheeldon)  yesterday used 3 words to which I wish to draw attention.

* He emphasised as long as he was here the **security** of Australia and more recently he was as much responsible as anybody here for making nuclear energy and everything associated with it far more acceptable to the people here and to people outside this place.

* There can be no doubt that achievement of a nuclear explosive capability by any additional state would endanger not merely the **security** of the region concerned but also international stability generally.

* I do not think that, from the very moment that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation matter was first raised in this House until the present stage, the Attorney-General in the Senate or the Prime Minister in this House have answered questions to the satisfaction of either the people of Australia or those of us who have asked the questions.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
(a) The Department of Social **Security** owns 40 computers.

* The computers are used to maintain Social **Security** records and make payments.

* The data stored in the computers is personal data of clients pertaining to their entitlement of Social **Security** pensions and benefits.

* From June 1967 to June 1 978 the number of social **security** pensions and beneficiaries has increased from 892,000 to 2,096,000.

* Over the same period the number of children and students receiving family allowances has increased from 3,835,000 to 4,305,000. 
and (4) While, as indicated in the answer to question 2, AIDC does not publish details of individual customers' accounts, it is incorrect to suggest that AIDC has operated behind a cloak of **security**.

* You cannot establish **security** on borrowed money.

* I have made inquiries of the Minister for Social **Security** to ascertain the position and to clarify some of the questions that have arisen.

* The Minister for Social **Security** indicated in another place on Tuesday that discussions on these matters raised in the honourable gentleman's question were to be held between the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and the Public Service Board and senior officers from the Department of Social **Security**.

* It is in difficult circumstances at the moment and I commend the Government and those responsible for introducing this bill very strongly because this scheme provides a degree of **security** for those engaged in the industry.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** been drawn to the lurid and somewhat garnish displays of political propaganda opposing the proposed national health scheme now being displayed in the waiting rooms of some doctors' surgeries in the Newcastle area?

* If not, has the Government made a decision to reduce the 25 per cent tariff cut in relation to textiles on the basis that charity begins at home and that our workers deserve **security** of employment before overseas workers in this industry?

* It has also meant that the skilled work force which is essential to a sound shipbuilding industry has not been given the confidence and long term **security** which is required in order to ensure productivity and the maintenance of skills- again caused by the Labor Government.

* Worse still is the fact that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  apparently has indicated to one of these parents in recent times that the handicapped children's allowance is to be subject to a means test.

* The Department of Social **Security** has the chief Commonwealth responsibility for the payment of cash benefits.

* I listened to what the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said in his reply to the speeches on the motion for the second reading of the Bill.

* Some employees have, or should have, a greater responsibility because of the critical nature of their work to the community and/or the form of their employment which gives them greater job **security** or other advantages.

* In return they have **security** of employment and other work advantages that are not available to others in the community.

* They are the envy of thousands and thousands of Australians who are without that **security** at present.

* We are considered to be an essential **security** industry in this country, a service acting in the national interest, and therefore we cannot strike'.

* Once again for **security** reasons, I will not give the actual date on which the Australian force is handing over to the South Vietnamese.

* The Corporation could assist and encourage people to obtain essential independence and **security** by owning their own home.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) When addressing the 6th National Conference of the Australian Institute of Directors on 1 April 1976, did the Minister say that she anticipated receiving an interim report from the Income **Security** Review Group during May 1976.

* It is the Minister's view that there are reasonable grounds which is a condition precedent to the issuing of a warrant on the application or request of the Director-General of **Security**.

* What we are dealing with here is the right of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to break and enter premises, to search those premises and in the course of searching to open any safe or box or blow any particular safe deposit box, to take out any parcel or envelope, to examine any records found therein, to make photographs of them and to remove any records so found.

* But we do not diminish from that role by endeavouring to create an intelligence and **security** organisation which carries the respect of the community, which can be believed to be operating in a truly bipartisan way.

* We do not diminish the function of the Attorney-General or the responsibilities of the Director-General of **Security** by writing into the Bill a provision that where these warrants are issued- they involve a very considerable encroachment on powers- information on that matter will be supplied to the Leader of the Opposition?

* The amendment refers to information being made available to the alternative Prime Minister who will be bound to pay regard to the conventions of that  office  and the information will be treated by him in exactly the same way as it is treated as a matter of **security** by the Attorney-General.

* The honourable member for Dundas, in order to take a schoolboy debating point, deliberately attempted to misconstrue what was said by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, This amendment will go a long way to securing the confidence of at least half the Australian community who at present are concerned about this legislation and want to see legislation which will mean not only that our **security** force can have the powers that it needs to act but also that the rights and hard won liberties of the people are maintained and are secure.

* On Thursday, 10th May you addressed to my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**, who was  representing me in the House at that time, and the Minister for Immigiation, questions relating to a proposed visit to Australia by  Mr K.  T. Li.

* I believe that there is no disagreement between the Parties within this House, or within the Australian **security** industry, as to the need for effective Federal legislation in this field.

* Equally, the raising of funds through **security** issues by business enterprises is not the preferred way of financing capital formation.

* I should like the Committee and the country to know that the Department of the Navy is seeking on every possible occasion to see where and how any of the timetables can be reasonably cut to ensure that the best possible equipment is provided for those who serve in the Navy and, furthermore, to ensure that the Royal Australian Navy, as it faces the very difficult years ahead, will make the maximum contribution to the welfare and **security** of this country.

* Even the lowest income earner who is conscientious should be able to commence to build himself a home which will be an asset and which will provide **security** for his family and for himself in his old age.

* A number of further applications are at present being processed in various offices of the Department of Social **Security**.

* -I ask the Minister for Social **Security** whether he is aware that a group of Hobart medical practitioners is planning to challenge Medibank in the High Court of Australia on the ground that there are differences in Medibank refunds among the States although tax scales are uniform.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** aware that the income limits to determine eligibility for pensioner fringe benefits have not changed since 1969?

* I wanted to raise the matters of narcotics, civil rights, **security** and some of the things which happen at international conferences and which relate to the human rights of parliamentarians.

* It must, for example, make cuts to the social **security** area.

* In the name of updating the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and our Customs laws under which drug traffickers are apprehended, we are breaking previously sacred ground.

* It has been the Government's longstanding policy to avoid comment on matters involving intelligence and **security**.

* There are good reasons for this policy in that the mere act of denying specific allegations can often provide important leads and be damaging to our own and our allies' national **security**.

* As part of our defence relationship with the United States, there have grown up extensive arrangements for exchanging information and views with a wide range of United States Government agencies including those in the intelligence and **security** field.

* Through these arrangements we have access to and exchange valuable information with the United States on a wide range of international strategic developments as well as **security** and intelligence matterssuch as espionage and international terrorism to name 2 examples- which contribute in the broadest terms to the protection of Australia and the Australian community.

* Our joint activities with them are important to the national **security** of both countries.

* The Royal Commissioner on **Security** and Intelligence,  Mr Justice  Hope, who was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in August 1974, has recently completed a most extensive series of investigations and reports on all aspects of Australian intelligence and **security**.

* Mr Justice Hope has made recommendations to increase the effectiveness of our internal **security** arrangements.

* These concern the Australian 
**Security** Intelligence Organisation in particular and are aimed at ensuring that it will be better equipped in the future to meet its responsibilities for investigating and providing intelligence about threats to the internal **security** of the nation.

* As I have already said in this House, I look to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to provide timely advice on all matters which might affect the **security** of this country, including improper activities by any foreign intelligence service in Australia.

* If one could relate this profit to a percentage of capital committed, then one would possibly find that it would not exceed the modest return which anyone would expect from an investment in the **security** of a bank or building society.

* by leave- The House will be pleased to learn that the Government has agreed on the need to proceed urgently with the contraction of a high **security** off-shore animal quarantine station.

* We are commencing a debate on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill as drafted by the Government.

* The word ultimately' does not assist the **security** service in conducting surveillance of people who it thinks are reasonably likely to commit violent action.

* We say that taking out the word 'ultimately' would still leave the **security** service free to conduct surveillance of people likely to use force.

* It was responsible for its own safety, **security** and for safeguards over exported material.

* The nuclear power industry was characterised by the same 'shell be all right' approach to safety, **security** and spent fuel problems that we have become accustomed to hearing from the Government.

* The whole nuclear industry is subject to questions of safety, **security** and economics.

* Secondly, we could have a nuclear safeguards, safety and **security** commission.

* I also said that we need a nuclear safeguards, safety and **security** commission that would have independent status, would not be subject to ministerial direction, and would report to the Parliament.

* The functions of such a commission, in my view, would be to set standards for inventory, and other aspects of safeguards to make rules for physical **security**, to set physical safety standards, to issue and withdraw licences for construction, et cetera, and to carry out inspections, investigations and inquiries to guarantee that those provisions are adhered to.

* To say that the percentage increase in funds allocated to it this year as against last year is greater than the percentage increase in funds appropriated to the Department of Social **Security** in the same period is to use a debating technique rather than to deal with matters of reality.

* Equally significant about the new period and relationships is the fact that the first time China has acted in the **Security** Council she has aligned herself with the United States and Japan in opposition to the Soviet Union.

* The fourth reason is that South Vietnam has been strengthening its **security** and improving the living standards of its people to such a remarkable degree that it is necessary for North Vietnam to strike now, or it will never be able to satisfy the people of South Vietnam.

* The Zambian authorities did not want to deal with these unwanted visitors and the Jehovah's Witnesses refugees were placed under **security** guards and only a few shipments of much needed food, medical supplies, bedding and so on, were allowed in.

* Has the honourable gentleman ordered this revision because certain of the proposed Act's provisions would compel his Government to release a number of documents which were suppressed by his AttorneyGeneral during the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation affair?

* I want to raise a matter which should be of interest and concern to all those who have extolled the virtues of Australian beaches and have benefited from the feeling of **security** of being watched over while using these beaches by those selfless individuals, the members of Australia's surf life saving clubs.

* This may not sound important to a person living in the **security** of Australia but it is very real to the person living in a country which faces takeover by a communist-dominated Pathet Lao movement.

* Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The reason why Standing Orders should be suspended to allow this matter to be debated is to expose to the Australian public the deliberate policy of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  since this Government came to office.

* Will he confirm or deny that the recent Australian Labor Party Federal Conference, where he and others learned to drive backwards in a desperate attempt to regain votes, cost approximately $100,000, including the cost of accommodation, overtime- including swimming time- transport, installation of a new switchboard and telephones, **security**, use of parliamentary typing pool staff, and even barbecues.

* The pulldevilpullbaker attitude of the various cliques and personalities - the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  the Treasurer, the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Labor Caucus - have ensured that sound economic and financial policies by the Labor Government are impossible.

* should guarantee their **security** and in return they should pursue the public interest'.

* It is just as unrealistic to expect that Australia could enforce adequate physical **security** over nuclear materials.

* Their particular situation must be looked at sympathetically by the Department of Social **Security** and I am appreciative of directions given already.

* Often, in the case of protective devices, a comfortable environment h as been established and the manufacturers and those involved in the operation have been content just to poke along comfortably in their sense of **security** and not make a sufficiently strenuous effort to relieve the taxpayers of Australia of the burden so imposed.

* At the moment the Government is killing the hopes of people who come to this country expecting it to be a place where there is economic opportunity and **security** for children.

* In his absence the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  will act as Treasurer.

* A few minutes ago - I am sure that this was accidental - the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  misrepresented certain legislation for which I was responsible as Minister.

* It is very bad when Ministers do this kind of thing- 
Is education to join health and possibly **security** as a victim of real cuts?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The Department of Social **Security** does not knowingly grant pensions or benefits to persons who have entered Australia without an entry permit.

* As a consequence it would be exceptional if any Vietnamese people who originally came to Australia as 'unauthorised arrivals' are receiving Social **Security** benefits while not holding entry permits.

* -Firstly I congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  the Ministers in charge of the portfolios to which I wish to refer, for the responsible, constructive, compassionate and successful way in which they have administered their portfolios.

* I refer, first of all, to the Department of Social **Security**- the responsibility of  Senator Guilfoyle.

* Because of this, I am pleased to hear that the Minister has instituted an overall review of the Department of Social **Security** to implement improvements in it.

* The single parent benefit is the greatest gap in our social **security** system.

* I just refer to the cash disadvantage within the social **security** system.

* I hope that she can be successful the next time around in plugging what, as I said, is the biggest gap in our social **security** system.

* I note also that other reviews within the Department of Social **Security** are under way on the whole income **security** system and, in relation to the Department of Health, the Bailey task force has possibly reported to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  by now.

* I refer the honourable member to paragraph 8 of a note submitted by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation on 19 September 1972 to  Senator Greenwood  when Attorney-General.

* The senator tabled it on 4 April 1973. 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Let the Prime Minister's own leadership be examined because, after all, he criticises the leadership of others.

* Take the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation raids, the midnight intrusions into the homes in Sydney with Commonwealth police everywhere.

* Mind you, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren),  the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and each other Minister one by one tell us that the cuts are not to be in their departments and that they will spend much much more.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** been drawn to the reported allegation by the General Manager of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia that figures released this week showing a large increase in hospital insurance reserves had been 'deliberately distorted' - I am using the General Manager's words-to put the funds in a bad light?

* The future **security** of many schools and parents results from the introduction of the principle of less aid or none, if the system of independent schools proceeds to use more resources per pupil, or if the standard for aid is the resource usage in the average government school.

* Above all, because of the tight organisation of sugar production in Australia the industry must have **security** of markets.

* The Australian Labor Party knows where truth and justice lies in South Africa in assisting the blacks to economic **security** and political enfranchisement and dignity to where they can exercise their human rights.

* Everybody knows that there is no inhibition at all in respect of the provision of houses for people in the Territories or for Aborigines, migrants, servicemen, ex-servicemen, students and for certain recipients of social **security** benefits.

* In my book, pollution is the unnecessary, ugly or dangerous change in the environment which is not in the best interests of the community; not just in terms of finance and economics but culturally and physically in terms of its health or in terms of the real **security** of people.

* Is it not in the best interests of the community in terms of economy and of their physical health, culture and **security**?

* The reason I have a particular interest in this matter, apart from the fact that the project is situated in my electorate, arises from the fact that I was Minister for Social **Security** at the time at which the program was approved by the then Australian Government.

* I also was the local member of parliament who happened to be the Minister for Social **Security** at the time and who took a great deal of interest in the program from its inception to the point where approval was provided for it to get underway.

* We had in addition a situation fairly recently in which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  virtually threatened the people of Queensland with a loss of a substantial grant of money if they did not be quiet and take the Government on its face value.

* It is not the large financier who invests in building societies; it is the average working man who puts his savings into a building society because of the interest rate, the **security** and the readily accessible nature of his investment.

* In addition to that, the Prime Minister's Department is responsible for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The point I come to is this: While an age pensioner was away from his home, his wife was confronted by an officer of the **security** service or Commonwealth Police.

* 1 want to know, the House ought to want to know and the public ought to be informed why age pensioners or their spouses are called upon by representatives of the **Security** Organisation.

* I direct a question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* If not- 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* At 30 June 1976, 719 500 social **security** pensioners were aged 70 years or more.

* I believe that there has been incompetence in the Department of Social **Security** with regard to this matter; so does the DirectorGeneral of the Department.

* But so that things can be kept in balance, let me say also, because I think we need this caveat, that by and large the officers of the Department of Social **Security** are efficient and dedicated and discharge their jobs properly.

* This is a clear consequence of events which indicate incompetence in the Department of Social **Security**.

* Although he certainly advised on 18 July in the normal review form which he filed with the Department that he would be resuming work, according to the advice that I have received from the Department of Social **Security**, at no time did he make any effort to contact the Department and advise that cheques were continuing to arrive at his home.

* We do not want to damn the great majority of officers in any Government department, in this case the Department of Social **Security**.

* That person had a telephone communication with an employee of the Brisbane office of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I think that people who have no compassionate understanding of other people's needs- people who have fallen very heavily and severely through the vicissitudes of life- should not be in the Department of Social **Security**.

* To me, it seems to raise questions about the guarantee of **security** which is associated with Public Service employment.

* I must qualify again what I am saying with this reservation: Overwhelmingly, I could not criticise the officers of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The people working in the Department of Social **Security** by and large are the same people who worked in the Department of Social Services.

* Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar)-I think that quite innocently the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has misrepresented what I said.

* He mentioned what had happened in regard to the Joint Committee on Social **Security**.

* Very clearly problems will arise if we try to interfere and direct that Aborigines shall not spend their social **security** benefits in the same way as other people.

* Tribal groups have suffered a rather severe cultural jolt as a result of the introduction of payments to them of social **security** benefits.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 29 May 1979: 
1 ) What are the currently established regional boundaries for the Department of Social **Security** in the northeastern corridor of Melbourne.

* Is it normally the practice for the Department of Social **Security** to consult with a local Federal Member prior to establishing regional offices or rearranging regional boundaries.

* Construction of a perimeter **security** fence, gate control, official government vehicle garage, drivers' room and flammable liquids store are also included in the proposal.

* The whole area of social **security** involves people who through no fault of their own find themselves in deprived conditions- socially, emotionally and financially.

* There are situations where an applicant owns a dwelling jointly with another person, but where the dwelling is for the exclusive use of the applicant and is not occupied by that other person, who may have joined in the title merely to assist in the loan **security**.

* This means social **security** and welfare, and public health.

* I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, by assuring the House that I have no vested interest in its outcome.

* The honourable member for Ballarat is quite right to infer that in those circumstances, taken with its other attendant qualities, this form of investment is a very attractive form of short-term **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The Department of Social **Security** has a central library in its head office in Canberra and a branch library in its state headquarters in each of the six Australian State capital cities.

* in the fields of ADP, social work, homes for the aged, rehabilitation and income **security** matters.

* We have noted that the United Nations **Security** Council has condemned very strongly these acts and the perpetrators of them.

* The American Government has taken some positive action by putting **security** guards on their aircraft.

* The Israeli and Ethiopian airlines also have **security** guards operating on their airliners.

* Is the Prime Minister aware that  Sir Garfield  Barwick, described eavesdropping as abhorrent and that  Sir Robert  Menzies was emphatic that its use should be restricted to matters involving national **security**?

* Consumers temporarily might get some advantage, but if this means undermining the **security** of large primary industries in either country, it is not in the national interest.

* During my comments I wish to put several questions to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The Committee comprises myself as Chairman, the Minister for Social **Security**, the Treasurer, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, the Minister for Environment and Conservation and the Minister for Tourism and Recreation.

* The time given to me, however, does not enable me to indulge myself in the pleasant pastime of being unduly polite to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I think that if he will look at what was spent in my time as a Minister and compare it with what is being spent by the present Minister for Social **Security** he will find that nearly 10 times as much is being spent now.

* We will remember the former Leader of the Government in the Senate, the then  Senator Murphy,  who carried out an illegal raid on the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation without a warrant, just cause or the approval of his Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam).

* The long administrative delays are creating great hardship in relation to such schemes as the National Employment and Training scheme and in the field of social **security**.

* It is perfectly natural to expect people employed in an industry to look for job **security** and for an increasing opportunity for employment in the future.

* Honourable members on the other side of the House supported the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in doing so and now we are left with something - 
What is the score as far as Australia is concerned?

* I think the whole philosophy of our approach to social welfare and the **security** of human beings is under discussion here today.

* The reason for that is that it would be very difficult for the listening public to pick up the continuity of what we are discussing here, namely, the Government's Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill.

* The honourable member for Corio has moved that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the motion to refer the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill to a legislation committee being determined on a majority vote.

* They demand the right to show their ability and to utilise their arts and crafts so that they may live in **security**.

* The Government is convinced, however, that the measures that it has now determined will result in greater work **security** for more employees than would otherwise be the case.

* I hope that we have seen the last of red threats and snap purchases of Fills, as a means to delude the public into thinking that an Australian Government was really concerned about the **security** of the nation.

* For the first time in many years we have a Government which recognises that the totality of this nation's **security** lies in the complete integration of its foreign policy, defence planning, international trade; indeed all aspects of our relations with the outside world, lt is in this totality of how we see the outside world and how the outside world sees us, that the true **security** of Australia must be planned.

* From this the Government will be able to estimate what capability will be required at different levels of threat, should they ever eventuate, the types of equipment, force structures and so on, which are most relevant to our basic **security** needs.

* As a further part of this effort to define the real defence priorities for national **security**, the Government has ordered other studies to find the most efficient locations around Australia for the various defence facilities required by the armed forces.

* Much detailed work has yet to be done to complete them and further time will be needed to assess the implications of their findings and combine them all into a coherent reality strengthening the development of the nation's **security**.

* They agreed that in developing the concept embodied in the General Assembly resolution along these lines there would be no incompatibility with existing **security** arrangements. '

* The fact of the matter is that this Government's policies have delivered to the average Australian a degree of economic predictability, **security**, incentive and hope about the future that we have not seen during the 1970s.

* This matter I propose to mention refers to the Prime Minister's answers - or lack of answers - in regard to **security** checks for ministerial staff.

* The Prime Minister in answering questions about **security** checks of ministerial staffs seemed artless enough, but I wonder whether he was being quite frank with the House.

* The Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  has insisted that none of his staff be checked out by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, it was learned yesterday.

* The sources said it would be up to individual Ministers to decide whether their staff should undergo **security**, checks.

* It is understood that the move has caused some concern in departmental circles because access to secret documents would be granted to persons about whom the **security** service knows little.

* The Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  has reversed his stand on **security** checks of his personal staff.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is now running **security** checks on all of  Mr Whitlands  staff who had not previously been cleared.

* Mr Whitlam  had at first refused to allow members of his staff to be cleared by **security** as he believed that as personal appointments they were to be trusted implicitly.

* It is understood that  Mr Whitlands  staff volunteered to be cleared by ASIO to prevent any possible trouble that might arise if there were a major **security** breach.

* It is known that the members of the staff of the AttorneyGeneral,  Senator Murphy,  also volunteered to undergo the **security** checks.

* But the question of clearance of Prime Ministerial and Ministerial staff has now been reviewed and the Whitlam staff, along with others, will now go through the **security** mill.

* The one proviso still being thrashed out is that if a staff member violently objects to a **security** clearance he may be exempted.

* Today the Prime Minister said that he did not know which Ministers had had **security** checks on their staffs.

* He said that some Ministers may have had their staffs checked by **Security**.

* The one proviso still being thrashed out is that if  a  staff member violently objects to  a  **security** clearance he may be exempted.

* If this is so, is this a man who is to be exempted from **security** clearance because he violently objects?

* In addition to the improvements that I will detail shortly, there will also be increases in the rates of payment of service pensions that will result automatically from proposals that my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has already announced in the House.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) What was the amount appropriated for expenditure by the Department of Social **Security** in the division of Macarthur in the financial years 1972-73, 1973-74, 1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77. 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The British Parliament was told in 1961, in answer to a question, that of the 76 convicted murderers released from life imprisonment in the years 1956 to 1960 only 2 were convicted of subsequent crimes of violence, and they were not murder.

* High **security** facilities exist in the great majority of cases in which they are appropriate.

* I know of beef producers in the Paterson electorate who are not even receiving the equivalent of the social **security** payment of $48.50 a week.

* I am most concerned for school leavers because if these young people leave school and cannot find employment they can get into a situation where they are drawing social **security** benefits and the urge to work could disappear.

* Indeed, following representations I have received from several sources but persistently from him, I directed the Department of Social **Security** to make inquiries overseas as to what provision for benefits is made in several countries.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 May 1978: 
Under the new provisions superannuation payments will be maintained at the current level of purchasing power.

* This in itself gives a great feeling of **security** and indeed is a strong measure of justice.

* The computer of the Department of Social **Security** currently is churning out millions of queries to age pensioners, invalid pensioners and others in regard to the rebate which to date has been granted to them in respect of their telephone rentals.

* It is obvious, even to a blind person, that the decision made by the Department of Social **Security** was approved by this Government.

* I refer to legislation concerning the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* They know that for all the fine words of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  he has allocated them a priority that can be pushed off until next autumn, provided it does not have to be pushed off again.

* The Department of Social **Security** is not in a position to give the exact figure.

* I know that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has done something in the most urgent field- that is, in regard to the sheltered workshops- and I give him credit for that.

* I stated days ago that I did not know that the Attorney-General was going to visit the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Melbourne on Friday week.

* Again, in line with other decisions relating to social **security** and repatriation benefits generally, this will be part of budgetary decisions when these matters are under consideration in the very near future.

* We in Australia will retain responsibility for the external **security** and the foreign relations of the people who live within the Territory.

* The Department of Social **Security** advises that as far as it can establish there is no substance in the reports at all so far as it is concerned.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* These are similar to those applying to the Commissioner of Taxation and thereby ensure the **security** of tenure appropriate to an office which must operate without fear or favour.

* The Bilingual Education Consultative Committee comprises representatives of the Departments of Education and Aboriginal Affairs; the inter-departmental committee which co-ordinates activities relating to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory comprises representatives of the Departments of Health Aboriginal Affairs, AttorneyGeneral's, Education, Housing and Construction, Labor and Immigration, Northern Territory and Social **Security**; and the inter-departmental committee which co-ordinates the delivery of health care to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory is made up of representatives of the Departments of Health, Aboriginal Affairs, Education and Northern Territory.

* We allocated $5,389m for our continuing commitment to maintain and improve social **security** benefits and welfare services.

* I ask whether the Government has considered taking some **security** over school buildings and equipment for which it has granted financial assistance.

* I stated that Commonwealth expenditure on education, housing, social **security** and welfare will amount to almost $12 billion or about one-half of expected total outlays in this financial year.

* In view of the fact that the defendant said that he passed information about Australia to the Russians, is this not a grave breach of Australian as well as American **security** and does it not mean that the functions of the joint facilities may now be known to the Russians?

* Those who seek to share the nation's resources should clearly indicate the priorities of government expenditure in the fields of roads, transport, communication, social **security**, welfare, health, defence and education.

* Is the Government under any constitutional obligation to accept as policy any report of the sub-committee of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which is inquiring into implications on Australia's foreign policy and national **security** of proposals for a new international economic order?

* I should like to take this occasion to point outbecause it seemed to be relevant, during another debate last night- that to date the only Government speakers who have been heard to support this legislation were the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in the other place and the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt).

* The ultimate possibility arising from such appointments is that the public servant's promotional opportunities or even his **security** of office in the future may depend on his political affiliations and whichever party is in power.

* That redirection has taken us away from a premise of regional **security** and of developing friends and allies and close associates in the areas that surround us towards the presentation of the Prime Minister as a mini-Kissinger trying to participate in the solution of world problems.

* I believe it is important that not only in our relations with Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines, but also in our developing relations with the about-to-be independent Papua New Guinea, we should pursue a policy that maintains the line that has been so well and effectively presented for so long - the concept of regional **security**, which we should not forsake.

* If we are not accepted by our neighbours as friends and if we are suspect because of the policies, the statements and the prejudices that come from the members of the Whitlam Ministry as well as from the Prime Minister himself, it not only weakens our capacity to play a greater role in the wider world but it also weakens our own **security** and the stance that we believe we should have with those countries which over the 2 decades of Liberal-Country Party Government were seen to turn more and more to Australia as a leader in things that affected them.

* But more importantly and more significantly geographically at a time when Australia is becoming more competent and more respected in itself, it is losing respect because of the presentation of a policy which is denying the right and the role of this concept of regional **security** in the sphere of our principal influence.

* In reporting favourably on the proposal, the Committee has requested that the matter of **security** be kept under regular review and that if Commonwealth Police and/or departmental **security** staff are required, they should be located within the terminal building.

* If an unemployment benefit is withdrawn and an appeal is lodged with the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal, the unemployment benefit is not paid while the appeal is considered.

* An assessment of **security** arrangements at Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, has been carried out by the Hospital Work Study Officer in consultation with the Commonwealth Police Force, the State Police Department, the **security** staff of  Sir Charles  Gairdner Hospital and representatives of local **security** firms.

* The **Security** Assessment report is still under consideration.

* A recommendation relating to staffing is under consideration and will be determined in conjunction with the assessment of resources available within current approved ceilings and consideration of other matters relating to **security** at the hospital.

* (a) The classification for hospital **security** staff areSenior Hospital Patrolman- $8,772-8,942; Hospital Patrolman-$8,205-8,449.

* Matters relating to appointment, sources of recruitment and effects on staff ceilings must necessarily await decisions yet to be made on the recommendations in the **Security** Assessment Report.

* I want now to examine the Bill in a little more detail, particularly the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Indeed, there can be no doubt that this Bill has been drawn by the First Division officers in such a way as to maximise their own **security** and preserve their power.

* At the upper level there are to be established candidates or established permanent heads who will almost invariably be career public servants and who will enjoy the advantage of **security** of tenure.

* That, of course, assumes real importance in relation to the **security** of tenure that applies to a permanent head.

* We do not object to the lack of **security** of tenure for the non-established officers.

* The Government 's intention is that the Treasurer would provide such guarantees only in the early years of the Commission's private health insurance operations before it has built up reserves which it could give as **security** for its borrowings.

* We have seen the way in which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has set out systematically to destroy nursing homes.

* I suggest that if shareholders, the small investors, the business community and particularly the community as a whole seek to achieve any sense of stability, comfort or long term **security** from this piece of legislation and the subsequent complementary legislation- that is, the takeovers and companies and securities Bills- then regrettably they will be seriously disillusioned.

* The first amendment in 1964 was to establish a situation in which an exporter could take out a guarantee on a risk that banks in Australia would accept as **security**.

* But the fact that Australia's **security** is at stake and there is necessarily a need for Australians to recognise that they are very much alone in a world with which traditionally they have been associated means that, if we in this part of the world do not recognise that there are many thousands of people living in lesser developed countries very close to our shores and do not adopt a responsible attitude towards defence against the insurgence of Communism in that part of the world, we ourselves may ultimately be put at risk.

* Things seem to have settled down in the trouble spots in that country, but I think we should remember that the foreign policy element in New Guinea is very much dependent on its trade **security**- which, after all, is a pretty questionable situation- and is dependent almost entirely on one great industry.

* -This is a debate on four Bills- the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill, the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 [No.

* I want to deal with just a few points but before doing so I want to put in perspective just how important **security** legislation in fact is.

* Ultimately **security** concerns the defence of the realm, both domestically and externally.

* When a charter which is designed to balance corporate responsibility and personal rights is given to a **security** organisation the ultimate purpose of that charter is the defence of a country.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, it needs to be remembered, is not a policy agency.

* When a **security** organisation fails a nation is in jeopardy.

* In **security** matters this is always so.

* The House should consider the consequences when a **security** organisation fails.

* When Benes was the Foreign Minister and subsequently the leader of Czechoslovakia between the two world wars, the ultimate burden he carried into negotiations in the late 1930s was the fact that his own **security** organisation failed to inform him of the strife developing between ethnic groups within his own country.

* That is an example of the failure of a domestic **security** organisation.

* If a **security** agency fails- where it operates domestically- the nation is in danger.

* If a **security** organisation fails in relation to foreign commitment the foreign policy of a country can fall apart.

* Why does 1979-80 represent for the Opposition so much more purity than did 1 97 1 -72 in relation to our **security** organisation?

* We know and it is well attested that there was a psychological despair within the Australian **security** agency at the time of the raid.

* I can immediately think of a couple whose names would only have to be dropped for the **security** organisation to be in a shambles within a week.

* Was the Minister or the Minister for Social **Security** responsible early in the term of this Government for the change in the work test concerning eligibility for unemployment benefits?

* In the latter category are 1041 staff for the Department of Social **Security**- 913 for processing unemployment benefits and other social welfare payments and 128 for Darwin re-settlement activities.

* My final comment is related to the proposed Medibank scheme which is the brain child of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who is sitting at the table.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Police and Customs.

* Has the Minister seen criticism of the report from  Mr Carmody  seeking access to taxation and Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation data for the proposed police force?

* 8m and $4.5m for the Department of Services and Property for elections and referendum and for rent, respectively; $0.7m for the Department of Social **Security** for postage and telephone services following the easing of the means test; and $0.7m for the Department of Transport for payments to the State railway system for services rendered in connection with interstate passenger and freight traffic.

* Mr Woodward  at that time suggested that we needed the introduction of permanency of employment to give the Australian waterside worker a feeling of **security** so that in return he would put his heart into the job.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** aware that long term recipients of Commonwealth employees' compensation are in receipt of only $57 a week for a single person and that there are further reduced rates for dependants- the worst compensation payments in Australia?

* 1 per cent of government outlays; health, 2 per cent of government outlays; social **security** and welfare, 25.4 per cent; and payments to the States and local government authorities, 21.1 per cent.

* I take this opportunity to praise publicly the work done by members of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The people do not yet know what is intended because they were lulled into a state of false **security** at election time and on many other occasions.

* This allowance, administered by the Department of Social **Security**, is payable in respect of a severely handicapped child under the age of 16 years who is being cared for in a private home.

* I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** a question concerning the payment of unemployment benefits to school leavers.

* Will the new Director-General of Social Services now review the claim by last year's school leaver, Karen Green - 
I will not answer questions in Parliament or here or anywhere on **security** matters.

* The reason is obvious: by asking sufficient number of questions and then getting denials or confirmations or corrections people can find out about the **security** procedures about this country.

* However, I am advised that pensions provided by the Federal Republic of Germany are not payable to non-citizens residing abroad, except for those living in countries which have reciprocal agreements on social **security** with the Federal Republic of Germany.

* However 1 am informed that a social **security** agreement has been negotiated between Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany but that formal ratification is not expected to be completed for some time.

* I understand that, while no formal negotiations have taken place between West Germany and Australia, the question whether there is a suitable basis on which reciprocity on social **security** might be approached is being examined by my colleague, the Minister for Social Services, as part of an exercise involving the possibility and implications of social **security** arrangements with other countries.

* I want to touch on a matter that was referred to by the last speaker; and that relates to social **security** benefits.

* I am sure that the people of the island want to have the responsibility of determining their own future in as wide a range of matters of internal government as possible, but I believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that the people of the island are entitled to social **security** benefits as of right.

* I hope that the representatives of the people in the new legislative assembly will recognise the concern of this Parliament to ensure that the people are entitled to social **security** benefits as of right and are not dependent on grace and favour payments.

* But there are on the island a group of people who have not accrued those rights in some other country and it is proper that this Parliament and the Government here in Canberra should be concerned about the welfare and the **security** of those people.

* I want to look also at the problem of the relationship of the CES to the Department of Social **Security** in relation to the payment of unemployment benefit.

* I would have thought that there is now near universal agreement- at least there is agreement in all the reports that the Government has had- that we have an excessively complex, cumbersome and duplicatory system involving, in an unnecessary way, both the CES and the Department of Social **Security**.

* The claim forms have to go to the CES, which then forwards them to the Department of Social **Security**.

* The income statements have to be handed in each fortnight to the CES and then they have to be passed across to the Department of Social **Security**.

* In many parts of Australia the CES is known as the Commonwealth Unemployment Service' simply because it has got this negative image from its deep involvement with the Department of Social **Security** over the paying of unemployment benefit.

* I would have thought a minimal reform that even this Government is capable of carrying out would be to follow through the Norgard Committee's report and reduce or do away completely with CES involvement in the unemployment benefit program or, if that is not possiblethe Norgard Committee recognised that it might not be impossible- at least require only from the CES the initial registration with the CES and leave the unemployment benefit process in the hands of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I am attacking some 1,200 communist and left wing officials who are threatening the very **security** of this nation.

* -I understand that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill is not contentious and I think it is being supported by the Opposition, give or take a comma or two.

* The problems created by a **security** service are some of the most difficult to be faced in any democratic society.

* I say that **security** is an even greater option of difficulties.

* Another thing a **security** service must do is screen individuals who have access to our own or other nations' secrets.

* I would, however, like to see a system in which people whose promotions or careers are interrupted by adverse **security** assessments are notified of them and given a chance to appeal.

* I do not think it will ever be possible to have a person who has been accused and notified confront his accusers for obvious reasons of effective administration of our **security** service.

* We have set up a **security** organisation under a Director-General, a statutory authority who under legislation is as independent- I hope he is as independent- as the Auditor-General or the Commissioner of Taxation.

* Independence from direct political control is vital for the Director-General of **security**.

* Under the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act he is obliged to advise Ministers where he, the Director-General, is satisfied that it is necessary and desirable to do so in respect of matters relevant to **security**.

* The responsibility for **security** within a government department when it is advised by the DirectorGeneral of ASIO, rests with the department.

* That was interpreted, wrongly in my view, to mean the Attorney-General could give instructions about **security** matters to the Director-General.

* I do not believe that he can or should have been able to do so because the only lawful orders he can give would have to be authorised by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act or another Act of Parliament.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act gives no such power to the Attorney-General.

* Before the suspension of the sitting I had pointed out that the clear intention of this House in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act was to make the DirectorGeneral of **Security** an independent statutory authority free from any direct political control, but perhaps an unfortunate form of words in his conditions of employment had enabled 2 successive Labor Attorneys-General, the former  Senator Murphy  and  Mr Enderby,  to use that form of words in order to bring the DirectorGeneral under direct political control.

* This was a most regrettable step in the development of our **security** organisation.

* The late  Dr Evatt  in commenting on the role of the Director-General of **Security** in September 1949 said:  .

* the Director-General of **Security** is free from ministerial direction.

* the Director-General has been given complete authority on **security** matters and I do not propose to interfere with him in the discharge of his functions.

* I believe it is most important for the individual liberties of us all that the Director-General of **security** should be free from direct political control.

* The question of entering into a reciprocal agreement on social **security** wilh the Maltese Government is being considered, lt is nol possible to forecast the outcome of these considerations.

* Will the Minister for Social **Security** consider removing the 16-year-old qualifying age with respect to invalid pensions in order to provide relief for families who hear the immense physical, psychological and financial burdens of caring for their severely handicapped or retarded children at home?

* A convention on social **security** which was made between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom of Great Britain came into force 10 years ago.

* I have very strong views that such information should be used only within the Parliament for identification purposes concerned with **security** within Parliament House and in no circumstances should it be passed on to outside sources to be used for commercial or any other purposes.

* 1) In accordance with a resolution of 29 May 1968 of the United Nations **Security** Council, the Government is obligated to prevent the entry, save on exceptional humanitarian grounds, of any person travelling on a Southern Rhodesian passport.

* He seems to be drawing on his own experience as Minister for Social **Security** when he awarded very significant contracts to IBM without calling tenders - 
My office is in Darwin and I go there every second weekend while the House sits.

* This defence statement should hearten our friends in Malaysia and Singapore, and reassure them that we are conscious that our **security** is bound Up with the whole area of South East Asia.

* That on December 10, 1948, Australia signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads:'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* I have checked with the Department of Social **Security** and I am advised that the arguments which have been put forward by spokesmen for the funds are not legitimate arguments and are not accepted, and that the basis on which the Department has made these calculations on this occasion - and it is consistent, I repeat, with every past occasion when they have made these calculationsis legitimate and is valid.

* It produces no programme for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.

* Is it a fact that in his recent guest editorial in the Pharmacy Guild Journal Contact' the Minister for Social **Security** claimed that the Labor Government had generously increased dispensing fees for pharmaceutical benefits and made-up prescriptions by 8c, and that this action had been constantly rejected by the previous Government?

* A retraining program is being developed to ensure personal **security** in employment.

* I thank the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for tabling the various papers.

* Rather, arising from the resolutions that were adopted, there is a general commitment to increase the volume of aid aimed at increasing food production in deficit developing countries, improving nutrition and providing a greater measure of world food **security**.

* The Natural Disasters Organisation and the Defence Force, the Departments of the Northern Territory, Housing and Construction, Social **Security**, Manufacturing Industry, and elements of other departments all contributed to the relief operations.

* Where is the reasoning behind a program of social equality if that equality is to be achieved only by payments made through the Department of Social **Security**?

* One would expect this to be so because its basic aim is to bring to the industry **security** or protection against price fluctuation.

* In the context of my remarks about **security** Japan was never mentioned and was never intended to be mentioned.

* -As the honourable member is probably aware, the actual payment of unemployment benefits is under the control of my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**.

* They wanted an industrial confrontation situation which would justify the establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau which they are about to set up as a policeman, along with the trade union section of the Australian **Security** 
I want to draw the attention of the appropriate Minister to what is obviously a defect in the War Service Homes Act.

* Under that Act there is a definition of what is termed 'holding' as a **security**.

* These have been accepted as satisfactory from the point of view of war service homes **security**.

* In my electorate many returned soldiers have obtained war service home loans and erected substantial dwellings on **security** of land tenure from the New South Wales Government which is, within the meaning of the Act, virtually a holding but nevertheless is a leasehold type of holding.

* In other words the **security** would still be the same but the method of land tenure would be different.

* It would have no real **security** at ail.

* By doing so he would build up his equity in the land and indirectly give the Director of War Service Homes even greater **security**.

* He has a suburban holding which is again an acceptable **security**.

* It nullifies the whole concept of the Act if because the New South Wales Government decides to reappraise lease rentals and substantially increases them by 400% or more that in itself weakens the **security**.

* 1 19  (Hansard,  30 March 1 977, page 787), did the Government consider introduction of an inflation adjustment capital value orfloating interest rate type of new **security** an appropriate policy initiative on 27 November 1975.

* In reference to what I said earlier about the responsibilities of the industry, I say this: It seems to me that the industry, with all the protection that is given to it, has some responsibility to give the people working in it the **security** to which they are entitled.

* The power is subject to a qualification that the Ombudsman is not entitled to information in certain circumstances described in section 9, for example, where it would prejudice the **security**, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth, and the Attorney-General issues a certificate to this effect.

* -Never before have I spoken in this House on South Africa or southern Africa; but today is a very important day in respect of that part of the world for one overriding reason: Today the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations is to suggest to the **Security** Council the nature of the United Nations peacekeeping or supervisory force which is to go into the former territory of South West Africa, the territory of Namibia.

* We have been told of grave implications for our **security**.

* -I direct the Treasurer's attention to a memorandum written to him late last year by the Australian Statistician which referred to a survey of ownership of assets and debt holdings as 'valuable in the context of taxation and social **security** policy'.

* It is a project of great concern to the Parliament not only because of its high cost but, more importantly, because of the contribution the new tactical fighter will make to the long term **security** interests of this country.

* I preface my question to the Prime Minister by referring to an article in today's Melbourne  Sun  which reports the Prime Minister as having denied that he was briefed by  Mr Whitlam  on the reason for the dismissal of the then Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and that  Mr Whitlam  briefed him on an alleged infiltration of ASIO by the KGB.

* I appreciate the fact that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has said that this is a beginnig.

* That woman cannot make a claim under social **security** legislation in respect of that child because, in assessing the child 's entitlement to assistance, the amount of her war widow's pension is counted as income.

* What is left to a woman who is entitled to a war widow's pension because of the death of her husband through war-caused injuries is that she must forgo her war widow's pension and claim a social **security** pension in order to obtain what would be her right if the law were consistent in both instances.

* Under the social **security** Act it is provided that persons living in a situation which may be deemed to be similar to that of a married couple shall be treated, for the purposes of that Act, as being married.

* But, having denied the person access to the social **security** benefits available to a single person because the Commonwealth deems that person to be married, the Commonwealth then denies that same person- I can give instances involving exactly the same person- the right of being considered to be married in respect of taxation legislation where rebates for a wife are concerned under the income tax laws.

* I know that on occasions these do occur, but the Services are extremely anxious and keen to see that their establishments are always under the highest **security** and are well guarded.

* It adds nothing to the **security** of the area to establish bases throughout the Indian Ocean.

* The honourable member asked whether the 
That this House calls on the Government to immediately reintroduce the six-monthly indexation of social **security** and repatriation benefits.

* In so acting Australia must be able to protect its interests beyond, as well as within, its continental boundaries; to support its friends and its allies in the protection of mutual interests in the region; and, having these capabilities, to be able to continue to contribute responsibly to the development of a climate of confidence and **security** in the region and to the deterrence of threats generally.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* He admitted no evidence to back up this view but he believed that the Central Intelligence Agency and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation were also part of this plot.

* A scheme existed through the Australian Department of Social **Security** to assist the education of handicapped children by private charities, but not in State schools.

* Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs been drawn to statements that have been made by the eminent criminologist, Gordon Hawkins, which point to a dangerous and pernicious mythology in Australia today that Aborigines are paid in excess of what is paid to Europeans or white people, that is, through the Social **Security** Department?

* The matter which was raised is more in the nature of a matter of **security** and on that basis I have ruled that no prima facie case exists on the evidence which is contained in the newspaper article.

* I know that my colleague in the other place, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  has given an assurance that the Government will examine that as well.

* -The danger to democratic government in this country that is posed by not informing the Parliament is greater than any danger which could exist to **security** organisations in this country by parliamentary surveillance.

* The Government has also given very careful consideration to the needs of the community generally; our national, social, economic and **security** aspirations, and the financial implications of the development of a satellite communications system.

* We stand for **security** of tenure and pride in ownership, the very antithesis of the socialistic policies of those opposite in a minority government which upholds a policy that the Government should own everything - anathema to the average Australian and the very antithesis of our way of life.

* The first matter I refer to is the Medibank form which was placed in everybody's letter box in the last week or so with a booklet containing a letter from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I think that both employers and the Government have a responsibility to ensure the future and **security** of the redundant employees.

* But a little expenditure diverted to public transport from the enormous amount that we are spending on roads will solve many of our urban problems as well as providing **security** of employment in a gainful way for many skilled workers.

* All the equipment for Pine Gap has come in planes like this, landing in the late afternoon, unloading' behind a **security** screen, flying off into the night; the sound of their jets a reminder to Alice Springs of the world outside, its tensions and its perils.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:  'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.'

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) its breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.'

* I might mention also at the outset that the appropriations for the child care program appear in the Budget not under education but under the functional classification of social **security** and welfare.

* Then the Commonwealth Government, on the authority and **security** of the Commonwealth, borrows all the money.

* I must say in my opening remarks, however, that I feel that in some ways the Minister may be a compromised Minister in that his portfolio seems more closely related to either education or social **security**.

* by leave- The Treasurer  (Mr Howard),  in his Budget Speech, referred to changes in social **security** programs.

* The Treasurer, in his statement of 24 May 1979 in which he announced certain decisions on expenditure and taxation, said: 
Against the severity of these cuts there will be attempts to frighten people receiving Commonwealth social **security** pensions and benefits and repatriation payments.

* The Government has maintained social **security** payments.

* It has also been able to make some very worthwhile improvements to the social **security** and welfare system.

* But the Public Service offered **security** and a good pension or superannuation scheme, and that was an offsetting factor for those people who were prepared to forgo the salary that they otherwise may have been able to obtain in the marketplace.

* asked the Minister  for  Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The two leaders agreed that the fact there was a possibility of a renewed arms race between the super powers gave cause for concern, and any shift in the global balance between the super powers could have far-reaching implications for the long-term **security** of the region.

* Some time ago during the time of the Labor Administration there was a proposal to provide computer facilities to the Commonwealth Employment Service and to the Department of Social **Security** to facilitate the finding of jobs and the payment of the unemployment benefit.

* Has the Minister for Post and Telecommunications recently approved new arrangements whereby householders and post office employees are forbidden to redirect mail and cheques going to the unemployed from the Department of Social **Security**, and are forbidden to hold such mail for collection at post offices?

* In reaching the figure of $998m for unemployment benefits this year, will he inform the House as to the advice he received in regard to the total number of people who will be registered as unemployed when unemployment peaks in the figures released in February 1980, and the number of people who will be beneficiaries of social **security** payments?

* I emphasise this because, while universal health insurance cover provides **security** and access to health services, it does tend to weaken the perception of both the providers and the users of the real costs of those services.

* You cannot establish sound **security** on borrowed money alone.

* -The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  started his speech by tilting at windmills inasmuch as he set up sundry policies which the Liberal and Country parties have never advocated and then spent much of his speech in trying to knock them down.

* -I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I believe this must be seen in the context of the Government's forward looking social **security** policy.

* They undergird and give practical support to facets of the health and social **security** program.

* is health and social **security** legislation if it cannot be implemented because of lack of professional expertise?

* The ministries of Education, Health and Social **Security** are working in the closest co-operation, with Education providing the tools.

* I think that the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  detailed this matter adequately.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 November 1979: 
The Opposition does not oppose the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill.

* Probably the most important area of reform is the need to expand the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, particularly in respect of the Social **Security** Department.

* The amendments are technical and in accordance with the recommendations of the 
Is the office of the Department of Social **Security** to be moved to new premises in Hargraves Street, Bendigo, when they are completed.

* Has his Department checked to see if all sections of the Department of Social **Security** could be housed in the Fountain Plaza area where it appears that there is space available at a greatly reduced cost.

* If this were translated into increased savings for the average family man, intent upon providing the **security** of a home for his family, it would mean that he would have to increase his earnings by $48 a week which, when one considers the average wage of about $95 to $98, would make it an impossible task to clothe, feed and house his family.

* Our present peace-time strategy is to support as best we may over a range of policies the continuation of the presently favourable prospects for our national **security**; to maintain effective defence relations with our friends and allies, especially the United States and in our neighbouring regions; and to maintain a substantial and efficient forceinbeing that demonstrates our military capability to deal with situations that could develop with shorter warning and to expand in time should the need for this arise during the longer term.

* During the same period social spendingexpenditure on education, health and social **security**- nearly doubled.

* The **security** of the nation is surely one of them.

* I present the following paper: 
That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**'.

* To maintain the confidence of investors both local and from overseas is it essential to have a stable economy backed by a government whose political integrity indicates **security**  for funds Invested?

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with  a  view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'The House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them and, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.

* I am hesitant, as I said in my speech during the grievance debate this morning, to bring in such mundane matters as defence and the **security** of the country when more gripping problems are confronting us.

* 1 wish to take up, as I tried to do this morning, the remarks which were made by the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  on the question of the association of the Minister for Housing  (Mr 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The rate of supporting parents benefit does not represent the full value of income support available to a supporting parent through the social **security** system.

* The following table shows the maximum rates of social **security** payments available to a supporting parent beneficiary: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for External Territories.

* It is related to an important matter of principle, namely, the request made by the Papua New Guinea Government for the transfer to Papua New Guinea of power over internal **security**.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Is lt a fact, as alleged on the television program 'Federal File', that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representative for the interdepartmental meeting on 2nd March is not a public servant?

* We realise that this Bill gives a **security** to the industry until 31 December 1976.

* Has the Minister for Social **Security** seen reports attributed to the Victorian Miniser of Health,  Mr Scanlan,  that some of the Australian Government statements on its universal health insurance program were fraudulent, if not misleading?

* Unfortunately, the commitment which this Prime Minister has given is not to that region but to an international involvement which does not give the pre-eminence which previous governments gave to regional **security**, regional involvement and regional progress and development.

* I released a statement in Perth at the weekend indicating that the Government was considering these matters and that a working party from Treasury and the Department of Social **Security** was investigating the problems which were confronting voluntary agencies providing this sort of accommodation.

* That is the point and it is on that point that I asked the honourable member for Prospect to advise the Minister for Social **Security** to change the advertisements so that the fraudulent claim that the health insurance would be free would not be made.

* In these circumstances does the Treasurer share the opinion of the Minister for Social **Security** that it is a free scheme?

* These policies must facilitate the rapid and continuous improvement in the quality of life of all people, beginning with the satisfaction of the basic needs of food, shelter, clean water, employment, health, education, training, social **security** without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, ideology, national or social origin or other cause, in a frame of freedom, dignity and social justice.

* The Prime Minister foreshadowed this in his statement on intelligence and **security** arrangements on 5 May and reaffirmed it in his second reading speech on 15 September.

* I would like to touch also on the estimates of the Department of Social **Security**, which I would relate to the estimates of the Minister for Health in regard to the drug problem, and would refer to the fact that next year is the International Year of the Child.

* Apart from the serious effect this would have of increasing unemployment, will the Acting Prime Minister give an assurance that the Labor Government initiated improvements in the fields of social **security** and education will not join health in being further eroded by the Government in the forthcoming Budget?

* The honourable member would appreciate that making public the precise details of police at all major airports throughout Australia could compromise airport **security**.

* How often does one pick up a paper and see the leering face of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  or the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  trying to explain that some particular action of the Government is good.

* I believe that this is entirely consistent with Liberal philosophy, which seeks to encourage the individual to stand on his own feet and to reap the rewards of his own diligence while always remaining conscious of his obligation to help those less fortunate or capable than himself and, applying this view to social **security**, those less healthy and less fortunate than himself.

* Europe, formerly the cockpit of world wars on this globe of ours, shows increasing stability and **security** with the prospects  of  the Berlin Agreement and the entry of Great Britain into the European Community.

* It not only contains mutual guarantees which go as close as countries with federal constitutions such as our own and America can go towards positive commitment, but, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, it furnishes the framework of continuous co-operation and exchange of military information directed to mutual **security** and defence.

* The second strong line of policy has been that of close co-operation with our neighbours, directed to securing their rapid economic advancement and their selfsufficient **security**.

* As to the policy on regional **security**, the Australian Labor Party would unilaterally withdraw our troops from Malaysia and Singapore, would abolish national service thereby reducing our Army to two-thirds of its present size and would regard the limit of our territorial sea as the limit of action of our armed forces unless they went outside that limit at the request of the United Nations.

* This policy would of course irreparably damage our relationship with our neighbours and inevitably destroy their confidence in our will or ability to play any effective role in our regional **security**.

* In this chamber the Minister for Northern Australia,  Dr Rex  Patterson, will represent the Minister for Agriculture; the Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Mr Lionel  Bowen, will represent the Special Minister of State and Postmaster-General; the Attorney-General,  Mr Kep  Enderby, will represent the Minister for Police and Customs; the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Frank  Stewart, will represent the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation; and the Minister for Housing and Construction,  Mr Joe  Riordan, will represent the Minister for Labor and Immigration.

* That this House censures the Government for jeopardising Australian **security** and injuring our reputation as a reliable ally by: 
the action of the Prime Minister in making public information concerning Australia's **security**, for the purpose of relieving the Government from pressures exerted on it to withdraw all troops, contrary to its stated intention, by persons both in the Government and outside the Government, and foi failing to adhere to the Cabinet system by permitting statements by Ministers about matters outside their own ministerial responsibilities, and which are offensive to other countries.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 26 September 1979: 
That this House, mindful of the principles and philosophy of the Liberal Party to assist those in need, is anxious to protect the family and single people in the lower income groups from the worry of bills and charges for medical or hospital treatment due to illness or an accident, and therefore requests the Minister for Health to advise the medical profession that a confidential letter from a local justice of the peace, minister of religion, industrial chaplain or an officer of the Citizens Advice Bureau, Social **Security** or Welfare or Probation, in relation to any patient, shall entitle that medical practitioner to accept the patient as 'disadvantaged' and refer any charges to the Commonwealth for payment.

* What did go on between the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Prime Minister when the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  was away, which caused the Treasurer to return to Australia so rapidly?

* Has the Treasurer been framed by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)?

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security**: In the Minister's announced scheme for a socialised health service, which he assures us can be financed on a taxation levy of  1.35  per cent of taxable income, is it proposed that doctors will render their accounts direct to the Government?

* The fact that I have already introduced 2 Social Services Bills into this House since the Parliament was reopened on 27 February is evidence of the Government's intention to proceed as quickly as possible with a progressive re-structuring of our social **security** system.

* The Liberal Party sees a military threat to Australia's **security**.

* Without this mine the whole area will become a quiet and gradual drain on government funds in social **security** payments and other forms of assistance in years to come.

* No reasonable, decent, ordinary Australian citizen who shares that widespread concern about illicit narcotics traffic in this country can feel any comfort or **security** in the face of these disclosures, which heap upon each other fresh allegations of alleged incompetence or corruption in an organisation which was supposed to reassure us that we were being protected and that our children would be safe from the depredations of the worst form of criminal offence imaginable.

* However, my quick glossing through the appendices confirms a view which I established when I went through the secret, and therefore restricted, reports of the Hope Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** in this country.

* I certainly agree, in the interests of **security**, that some matters ought to be deleted.

* The major reason why the Hope reports have not been tabled is that they would have been an enormous embarrassment to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, in terms of its operations in the 1960s, and of even greater embarrassment to a government that sought consistently to cover up an organisation that had become thoroughly demoralised, incompetent in its operations, and deviant to the responsibilities which had been laid down for it by law.

* On the assertion of conservative politicans, ASIO was believed to have been a supremely effective and efficient **security** organisation.

* Following the giving of wide telephonetapping powers to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation it was reported in the  Age  of 14 June 1979 that the Victorian police are likely to press for the legislation to be extended to cover them.

* The report by  Mr Justice  Williams shows many parallels with the series of reports conducted by his brother judge,  Mr Justice  Hope, into Australia's **security** services.

* That includes the series of events- the chronological record of events- including all the correspondence and all the communications between each of the companies, the members of the Government and the Prime Minister - have been checked with all relevant permanent heads, namely, the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board, the permanent heads of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Trade and Resources, Defence, Administrative Services, Social **Security** and Finance, and the Australian Statistician.

* I can only assure the House that the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, who was appointed by my predecessor, as the honourable gentleman would know, will carry out the functions of the Act scrupulously.

* I refer the Minister for Social **Security** to various reports claiming that the Australian Government is not assisting aged persons to find appropriate accommodation and nursing home care.

* I address my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* -Senator Guilfoyle, the Minister for Social **Security**, on Friday.

* I am sure that the commitment contained in the Governor-General's Speech, reflected today in the very strong statement given by the Prime Minister, is an indication of the Government's good faith with the pensioners and the Government's intention to ensure that there is, as was expressed by the Prime Minister in his policy speech, a desire to ensure that there is a basic level of **security** below which no one can involuntarily fall.

* I was interested to read in the Minister's second reading speech that he sees as one of the objectives of the review of the income **security** system as a whole that is now taking place a desire to ensure that the amounts of pensions and benefits are determined and updated on a just and equitable basis.

* I refer to the examination that is now going on into the income **security** system.

* When we look at systems for income **security**, I hope that we will study very closely the recommendations of the Henderson committee with regard to the operation of the means test.

* I do hope that the committee looking into the income **security** system will give this whole matter the most careful consideration.

* I am delighted that the Government is looking into the whole income **security** system.

* I would urge the Government to set up a review to examine ways and means of giving people the **security** of knowing that they have made adequate provision for their funerals.

* I think this is a matter which should receive the attention of the Department of Social **Security**.

* It is for that very purpose that we have a national **security** agency.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation should never lose sight of that essential fact.

* Legislation relating to Australia's **security** always poses moral and practical problems.

* Should I behave as a member of a national parliament and accordingly hand over enormous powers to the agency which is charged with the task of enforcing and ensuring our national **security**, or should I behave as a representative of my constituency and in that respect place my priority on the protection of those individuals in the community on the basis of national **security**?

* The issue can be summed up with this question: Where does national **security** end and infringement of basic civil liberties begin?

* We must begin with terminology and define explicitly what we mean by **security**.

* Certainly, in reading the record of the Senate debate on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill, I see that the form of argument is conciliatory.

* The Government's belated procedure of keeping the Leader of the Opposition briefed in **security** matters is an example of the recognition of the need for compromise on **security** matters.

* Under his direction many sound reforms have been introduced to provide a more effective and responsible **security** agency.

* The changes are so far reaching that it has been necessary to repeal the Menzies Government's Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act 1956.

* At the same time, they have been taken without impairing or jeopardising the effectiveness of a responsible **security** organisation.

* If correspondence that I and many other honourable members have received has been any indication, the procedure for telephone tapping, the issuance of warrants for tapping, opening mail, installing listening devices, the supply of information for the responsible Minister, the scrutiny of ASIO's finances, the guidelines for **security** assessments and the notifications of adverse assessments are problems about which many in the community have expressed grave apprehension.

* The Bill proceeds on the basis that the personal integrity and bona fides of two men- the Attorney-General and the Director-General of ASIO- are sufficient to assure our continuance in the **security** process.

* Senator Evans  said of the Attorney-General: 
Australia's **security** cover blown as a result Our spies were not left out in the cold.

* Neither would our **security** be damaged now if ASIO revealed to the Parliament the numbers and the kinds of warrants issued for taps, listening devices, mail interceptions and so on.

* So too should the Australian judiciary be involved in our **security** network.

* The investigations by  Mr Justice  Hope and in South Australia by  Mr Justice  White and  Mrs Justice  Mitchell provided salutary lessons in the value of a judicial audit or a review of our **security** processes.

* I should like now to refer to Justice Mitchell's report on the dismissal of Special Branch Commissioner Salisbury as an example of the sensitivities which exist in the area of **security**.

* There is a direct correlation between finances and the sort of activities in which the **security** agency becomes involved.

* A financial accountability therefore is vitally important in ensuring that a **security** agency stays within the bounds of a democratic society.

* - Mr Deputy Speaker, I agree with your ruling that, in view of the fact that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  made certain references to Medibank in his second speech, the honourable member for Paterson  (Mr O'Keeffe)  was entitled to deal with the same subject.

* They do not want the public to know that they want the Commonwealth to pay 2 lots of benefits to people who go into private hospitals and that whilst this would increase the cost of the health scheme it would not increase the **security** of the people against hospitalisation or sickness.

* They do not want the public to know that if any private fund cannot provide financial **security** to its contributors in the transition to Medibank the Opposition would be opposed to the Government providing some **security** during that transition period.

* I have not had any conversation or correspondence with the DirectorGeneral of **Security** since the late afternoon of Saturday, 17 March last.

* I trust that members of the Opposition are doing their part and are reporting such matters to the Department of Social **Security** so that investigations can be carried out.

* The principal features of the Bill were outlined by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in his second reading speech.

* The Government has taken in this legislation another step to fill a gap in our social **security** system which should not have been allowed to continue.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
No.

* However, the Department of Social **Security** maintains an index of Questions on Notice and Questions Without Notice which are asked of the Minister and Minister representing the Minister where the questions relate to Social **Security** matters.

* It is, however, clearly in the public interest that the fullest possible information about national service and the arrangements adopted, consistent with **security** requirements and the interests of the men affected, should be publicly available.

* I made is perfectly clear when I took over this portfolio that apart from matters affecting national **security** I wanted to reveal to the Australian public how our Army works, the pressures involved and how our soldiers react to various circumstances.

* The honourable member for Sturt need have no misunderstanding about the fact that in the very near future many of these ailments from which we are suffering and many of these temporary remedial processes that are now under way will be improved and replaced by more adequate schemes and forms of government action which will bring about a sense of **security** for all people and which will have a very beneficial effect on the repatriation system that operates throughout the country.

* The establishment of an additional training scheme to be known as the Former Regular Servicemen Vocational Training Scheme will be of benefit to people wishing to re-establish themselves with a greater degree of **security**.

* The young wife entering marriage will be educated to a concern to look essentially to her financial **security** right from the beginning of the marriage.

* 1 ) In so far as the question may be seeking confirmation or denial of possible links that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation may or may not have with the South African Department of National **Security** (formerly The Bureau of State **Security**), I do not propose to comment publicly, consistently with the past practice of neither confirming nor denying speculations about national **security** matters.

* In accordance with the Government's bipartisan approach to **security** matters, arrangements could be made for the Director General of **Security** to brief the Leader of the Opposition on this matter if required.

* In so far as the question does not refer to the possible activities of ASIO, there have been no official or unofficial contacts between Ministers and officials of the Australian Government and the South African Department of National **Security** since November 1 975.

* However, investments by life insurance companies in Territory public loans in 1969-70 amounted to $7,340,000; this includes an amount of $6,290,000 invested in the special loan to finance the purchase of equity in the Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd for the 'benefit of the people of the Territory as a whole, In addition life insurance companies paid loans on mortgage and loans on **security** of policies amounting to $249,000 in the Territory in 1969-70.

* But at the same time, as a consequence of statements made by a Minister in this House, the actual **security** of investments in Papua New Guinea has been called into question and the manner in which the Government has been administering Papua New Guinea has also been called into question.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
**Security**, upon notice: 
The final possible threat that we mav face is that of invasion.

* The Opposition policy would have us retreat within our territorial boundaries and only take action beyond them if asked to do so by the **Security** Council of the United Nations, on which both Russia and Communist China have a veto.

* Whilst terrorism and **security** were played up, the urgent problem of surveillance of our 200-mile economic zone coastline did not rate a mention, despite the remarks today by the Prime Minister to the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea about aid to overseas countries.

* Looked at objectively and in the less emotive atmosphere of today there is no real evidence to support the view that Australia has suddenly come under siege from the threat of terrorist activity or that there is an urgent need for a rapid expansion of our **security** forces.

* The Hilton episode indicates rather- if we have learnt anything from itthat our existing **security** forces need to be made more effective, not necessarily increased, so that if somebody plants a bomb in a garbage can outside the door of an important conference we should have a reasonable expectation that the **security** forces will lift the lid and look into the garbage can.

* Listening to those defending the GovernorGeneral's Speech, I have been appalled by the number of Government supporters who have seen fit to launch scurrilous attacks on the courtesy and dedication of the staffs of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security**.

* This Vietnam affair, as I have often said and as I insist without hesitation, adds not one jot to Australia's **security** or prestige, and history is showing this to be true every day that passes.

* However, dealing rather with the latter part of the honourable member's question, it is obvious that since the conclusion of the last World War the interests of Australia and Japan in the modern world have become quite close and, to some degree, complementary, particularly in the economic field and, to another degree, in regard to the **security** and stability of the area in which we have been working together.

* The honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  the shadow Minister for Social Services, announced on 28th February last a national social **security** policy to cover all Australians 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

* For instance, there should be an agency or an office of the Department of Social **Security** in every town, regardless of its size, if we are to overcome poverty.

* On the contrary, it is evident that Commonwealth governments of all political persuasions, in the **security** of their control of the financial resources of the country, are coming more and more to recognise section 96 as the means of enabling them to overcome the constitutional limitations on Commonwealth power, and as a strong stick with which to beat the States into accepting the role of executive agents for Commonwealth-conceived policies.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Is the Minister for Social **Security** aware of today's statement from a source not noted for its sympathy to the Government, that under Labor's health insurance program patients will enjoy the widest possible freedom of choice?

* My question is also addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* We are talking now not only about the freedom of Australia and the maintenance of the Australian democracy but also the **security** and integrity of the Australian continent.

* In conjunction with my colleagues, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street),  I am reviewing the relationship between widespread Aboriginal unemployment and social consequences, in many cases disastrous for communities in remote areas, of the payment of unemployment benefits.

* In conjunction with my colleagues, the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  and the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt), 
I wish to say a few words on defence following my experience when in the last Labor Government from the point of view of Australia's **security**, its future and its ability to take part in world discussions related to future conflict perhaps, or the easing of tensions as we would much prefer to advert to here.

* Since that time the section of the Department of Social **Security** which dealt with the production of such material has been transferred to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

* Are staff shortages in the Australian Public Service affecting the services provided by his Department and others operating in the Northern Territory such as the Department of Health and the Department of Social **Security**?

* As a result of the changes that we have made, nursing home patients in this country have entered a new era of **security**.

* Since his Attorney-General raided the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation quarters in Canberra and Melbourne on 16th March - 12 days ago - the only explanation by the Government has been that a statement would be made in Parliament when it resumed.

* I can only say this to the honourable member I know of one or two instances raised by honourable members on this side of the House in which particulars were supplied by the Department of Social **Security**.

* I think one of the principal exponents of the objections was the lady who is now the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* Precast concrete panels were necessary for the Inspectory building as brickwork would not meet **security** requirements.

* Clause 16 is a beneficial amendment in that it corrects a drafting error which was detected by the Department of Social **Security** and which had unintended effects.

* The policy of successive governments of all political persuasions has been to prevent the entry of people who could be described as being a possible threat to the internal **security** of the nation.

* In September 1973 the Parliamentary Standing Commiittee on Public Works reported to the Parliament in favour of the construction of a maximum **security** animal quarantine station on the Cocos Islands.

* I present a paper which is entitled Liberal Party of Australia - Committee on Social **Security**, Health and Welfare, Policy Recommendations.'

* i wonder what the **Security** Exchange Commission in the United States of America would say to practices of that nature in respect to US corporations.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Did German and Australian negotiators meet in Bonn on 26 and 27 May 1975 to discuss a German-Australian Agreement on social **security**.

* Is it a fact that many Australian citizens formerly of German nationality have been greatly disadvantaged because of the present position where Germans lose their entitlement to their contributory social **security** system when opting for Australian citizenship.

* The Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Chairman), Foreign Affairs, Attorney-General's, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Health, Employment and Industrial Relations, Business and Consumer Affairs, Primary Industry, Aboriginal Affairs, Social **Security**, Transport.

* and (3) The information required for these parts will be made available by my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**.

* That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.

* During his absence, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is acting as Treasurer.

* The Fraser Government's failure to respond to the crisis in the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry, with appropriate policies to improve consumer demand and provide a viable future with resulting employment **security**.

* It will damage the morale and the **security** of employment of the people in the work force, because the more the Opposition talks about the prospect of a sales tax cut, the more people will refrain from buying a car in case the price is going to be reduced.

* The Department of Social **Security** has had to contract out its computer programming because it does not have sufficient staff to carry out this function itself.

* As I have said, near breakdown conditions exist in the Department of Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 8 September 1977: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The real summation of this Budget has been recorded outside this House.

* Perhaps the most cynical move, although there are several outstanding contenders for this award, was that at a time of record unemployment and in a Budget deliberately designed to increase unemployment- the Treasurer admitted that at Question Time this afternoon- the only Public Service staff ceiling increase was in the Department of Social **Security**.

* The additional cost of providing twice-yearly indexation in respect of Social **Security** pensions and benefits is estimated to be $51m in 1979-80.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  must have overlooked the fact that, because of the peculiar way in which this clause is drafted, it takes away certain of those privileges.

* This is a matter in which we can all be concerned and which by no stretch of the imagination at this moment could be considered as a matter of great secrecy or even **security**.

* At the time, the Prime Minister stated that any document or part of any document which had **security** content applicable to both the U.S. and Australian Governments would not be disclosed.

* if the deficiency payment were part of the proceeds of the sale, or of a sale of the wool outside Australia, as the case may be, a person would be entitled or authorised to receive, or a person being the registered person by whom the deficiency payment is payable would be entitled or authorised to retain, the whole or a part of the deficiency payment by virtue of a **security** assignment, direction or authorisation given by the producer or a right of set-off.

* Australian pensioners going to Britain or New Zealand for permanent residence at present lose their Australian pensions but may receive, under our comprehensive reciprocal agreements on social **security** with those countries, the pensions of the country in which they are living.

* Yet all that this Government can do is employ a few more people in trench coats in the Department of Social **Security** to hound the young people of Australia in the hope that it can stop them getting $36 a week unemployment benefit.

* Yesterday we had the eloquence of the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  who disagreed with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* This shows what is in the minds of people - regrettably, the Minister for Social **Security**, who is at the table, is getting to that stage too - who are living in the past and who are determined to stay there, feet, heart, soul and everything else associated with them.

* If he believes that uranium involves the **security** of Australia, why has he eradicated all Government involvement in this industry, leaving the exploration for and processing of uranium to private companies, many of which have foreign content and many of which have very small amounts of paid-up capital?

* I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will ask the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who will be in charge of the Bill, to look at this clause extremely carefully because it questions our rights in relation to what we have responsibility for when compared with State rights.

* These do occur from time to time, and are usually due to the fact that the item is in a **security** storage area or another repository.

* Damage has been done to the reputation of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, which other countries and our friends are entitled to rely on when they give Australia help in military intelligence.

* The article read: 
The main thing to emerge from his remarks last night was his firm support for  Senator Murphy's  highly publicised confrontation with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in Melbourne last Friday.

* However, they are outposted to the Department of Social **Security** in each State.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I address a question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1978: 
I wish to comment on two or three points arising from the Bill which is, from the point of view of the Minister for Social **Security**  Mr Hayden)  basically a tidying up measure.

* I believe that it is a great pity that in this Bill the Government did not take the opportunity to cover not only the abolition of the $10 charge for hearing aids - which I certainly support - and the other matters, such as the transfer of certain responsibilities to the Department of Social **Security**, but also to include the necessary amendments to update the present national health scheme and overcome its accepted weaknesses.

* That is due to the decision of the Government in the early 1950s to curtail the extent to which trading banks could discount the promissory notes and hire purchase agreements offered as **security** by various finance companies.

* I ask a question of the Minister for Social **Security** concerning the Australian Labor Party's proposed health scheme.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** a question concerning a survey on incomes that has been conducted by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry into Poverty.

* In answer to the point of order, from correspondence that I have received as Speaker, the particular firm concerned is seeking discontinuance of the Superannuation Bill, the Corporations and **Security** Industry Bill, the proposal for an amalgamated Australian police force, the national superannuation scheme which is a policy proposal, I presume, and not a piece of legislation, and a number of other pieces of legislation which have nothing to do with the insurance legislation that is before this House.

* One was for an amount of $ 15m for  Mr Bajius  who is now a fugitive from justice and one of the men who was tested by the **security** service or someone else as to integrity.

* To summarise the terms of the Convention, States Parties thereto declare that Apartheid is a crime against humanity and that acts resulting from the policies and practices of Apartheid and similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination are crimes violating the principles of International Law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and constituting a serious threat to international peace and **security**.

* With respect to the suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition that there was something untoward in a visit by a member of this House to Rhodesia and a contravention of the **Security** Council resolutions to which he referred, I undertook yesterday to provide on notice a response to his question.

* The Migrant Community Resources Branch of the Department of Social **Security** is being dismantled.

* The latter duties gave rise to circumstances in which servicemen guided official vehicles but did not comprehend any assumption of general traffic control or **security** functions.

* I take the opportunity in the same spirit as did the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  to debate this matter calmly and rationally and to say that I believe the Minister will monitor this and other amendments to the social **security** structure of this nation over the next few months to ensure that unwitting hardship is not caused to sections of the community.

* After all, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  have advocated this in their rhetoric.

* Judging from the performance of my colleagues opposite over the Aurukun situation I am afraid- in fact I am certain- that there is no **security** in this legislation.

* If we take the analogy of Aurukun and transfer it to the Northern Territory situation what guarantee do we have that the Aboriginals will have permanent rights and **security** of tenure of their land?

* It is my firm conviction that there is only one **security** against governments and legislative assemblies in the Northern Territory, Queensland or anywhere else that we can give to the Aboriginal people as to their lands.

* I can see no **security**, no absolute tenure for the Aboriginal people, unless we do that.

* First, that there is no restriction whatsoever on the movement of Australian people to China; provided only that they can get a visa from the Chinese and provided that **security** considerations are not involved.

* On 28th July, the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  reaffirmed our position, saying that we have no hostility to the great 
It seems to the Australian Government both inevitable and desirable that the People's Republic of China should be represented in the United Nations and should hold the China seat in the **Security** Council.

* On the contrary, by indicating that we think it desirable that the People's Republic should hold the China seat in the **Security** Council we have gone beyond what many countries have so far been prepared to concede.

* Perhaps the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  or the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair),  could consider the possibility of preventing further unemployment through a scheme of that kind.

* It might have worked for a while but there was no continuity or final **security**.

* -I think this is fairly typical of the approach we can expect from the Australian Labor Party; it believes that all production must be in the hands of the Government and that that is the only way Australia's **security** can be looked after.

* To imagine that the Government has to do this to ensure **security** is just ridiculous.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Has his attention also been drawn to indexed item 100- Protective **Security** Handbook.

* You are assembled at this Second Session of the 27th Parliament to consider and decide on matters affecting the **security** and growth of the Australian nation, and matters concerning the welfare of the citizens who constitute that nation.

* This statement will outline the attention being given to the longrange strategic policies which will best serve Australia's **security**.

* My Government believes that this continuing Australian presence will be seen as a contribution to the **security** of Malaysia and Singapore and to stability, progress and cooperation in South East Asia.

* Has the Prime Minister seen reports criticising  Mr Justice  Hope's recommendations that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation be given wide powers to protect Australia's **security**?

* -I raise one or two matters in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill which are still outstanding.

* In this clause there is also the definition of acts- this ties in with unlawful actwhich fall within the ambit of this clause and which has nothing to do with the **security** or defence of Australia.

* I think it should be made clear in this Committee stage that this clause can be used by the Government for civilian purposes which have no significant **security** or defence capacity.

* Should such a situation occur where those people who have genuine objections to the mining and export of uranium seek to take action to demonstrate that proposition- and the Prime Minister uses his national **security** powers, as I am sure he would if he thought it was politically advantageous to bring the Army in on a pretext of national **security**- and picket, demonstrate or in any other way protest against the loading, shipping or movement of that uranium, they will find themselves in breach of the terms of this clause and be deemed to be carrying out acts of subversion.

* I remind the House that there is no provision in this Bill for any audit of the actions of the **security** organisations.

* It follows from this that proposals must enjoy widespread support among member states and, in particular, the support of those member states who, by virtue of their permanent membership of the **Security** Council, have special responsibilities for the implementation of the Charter.

* If they are ever to be withheld it must be on the basis of information from very responsible authorities relating to crime and/ or the **security** of the nation.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security**: Did he mislead the House on 2 occasions last Thursday evening?

* On that occasion the right honourable gentleman invited me to confirm the **security** of tenure of two of my Ministers.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* If so, is it a fact that grants have been made by the Minister for Social **Security** under the Australian Assistance 
If so, was his advice sought by the Minister for Social **Security** before these projects were approved; if so, when; if not, why not?

* The Minister talks of Australia having 15 years supply of fuel so that he can build up a false sense of **security** and give himself time to work out his plans for his great dream of a Petroleum and Minerals Authority.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 August ,1977: 
-I address my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* They should be attached to Oxley but of course that would be very embarrassing for the present incumbent, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  who is battling to hold his seat.

* In conclusion, I urge the Government also to ask the Department of Social **Security** and the Taxation Office to get together and to devise a common form so that pensioner taxpayers can present one form for tax purposes as well as for pension purposes.

* My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** and I have undertaken a review of the work test.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to an answer provided by the Minister for Social **Security** relating to payments for VIP aircraft as reported in Senate  Hansard,  3 April 1979, page 1 2 1 1 ; if so, is he able to provide specific details of each of the estimates on which the amount of $ 1 3.865m was authorised for expenditure from the Advance to the Minister for Finance on the 2 VIP Boeing 707 aircraft purchased for the Prime Minister's use.

* As the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  pointed out, this legislation is almost mirror legislation of legislation I introduced as Minister for Social **Security**, I think for the second time, in February 1975, having introduced it, I believe, in 1974.

* When I was Minister for Social **Security** I was always at a loss to understand the emotionalism injected into the Opposition to what we were proposing, because I knew full well from private discussions I had had with honourable members who had served as Ministers with previous Liberal-National Country Party governments that they had difficulties with the private health insurance funds not enormously different from the problems we had.

* 3212 (XXIX) of 1 November 1974, **Security** Council resolution 353 of 20 July 1974 and General Assembly resolution no.

* I feel it necessary at this stage in the debate on the estimates for the Department of Health, the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to reply to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  and my friend, the honourable and gallant member for Wills  (Mr Bryant).

* The same thing applies to social **security**.

* I repeat that it has been clearly demonstrated from **security** reports that to continue to allow a national leader to travel by commercial aircraft would be to take **security** risks which we as a government are not prepared to take.

* In addition, when a Prime Minister travels by commercial aircraft there is enormous inconvenience to other people because of the tight **security** arrangements which are necessary.

* The Government's decision was based upon **security** advice.

* It was in the interests of the **security** of this country.

* I certainly do not agree that these amendments do not stand judgment in their own right and I certainly do not agree with what I regard as the specious argument of the honourable member for Denison when he says that the effect of these amendments would be to politicise the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* Proposed sub-clause (4) which has to be read in conjunction with clause 8, limits the availability of a dossier or record concerning a particular individual unless the Director-General considers that it is in the interests of **security** that the Minister should have such access.

* They do not make Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation files.

* But  Senator Greenwood,  whose mind seemed to be running along the' same lines as that of the honourable gentleman on this matter, asked  Senator Douglas  McClelland, who represents the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in the Senate, on 28th March of this year what would be an estimate of the additional cost of benefits provided for in the current amendments now before the House.

* The three departments with which we are dealing- the Department of Health, the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Veterans' Affairs- make up quite a significant portion of the Budget allocation.

* In fact, the Department of Social **Security** alone accounts for $256m of the Budget allocation this year.

* The debate on that Bill somehow or other gravitated around the off-shore high **security** animal quarantine station.

* However, we cannot do that until we have a high **security** animal quarantine station which must be situated at least 400 miles off-shore.

* My question relates to the recent Cabinet decision to exclude from the 1971 census certain questions about incomes, sources of finance, social **security**, insurance and housing facilities.

* Among the disadvantages of being a part time and not a full time employee is the lack of reward for service and lack of financial **security** which are embodied in many ways in long service leave conditions.

* Mr BOURCHIER (Bendigo) &lt;8.&gt;10)- In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Health, the Repatriation Department and the Department of Social **Security** I would like to mention firstly the community welfare centres that were introduced this year.

* I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  at different times.

* Perhaps this is not really related to the Department of Social **Security**.

* I refer particularly to people in country areas who have suddenly found that their telephone rentals have increased and that the concessions they receive from the Department of Social **Security** do not make up the difference.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
When the announcement of the withdrawal of a further 150,000 troops from Vietnam was made in April of this year there were certain conditions under which the withdrawals would take place.

* Secondly, there was the fundamental principle that in withdrawing the troops there should be complete protection and **security** for the allied forces, including the Americans there.

* The honourable member will be aware that on the day following his asking the question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, responsibility for the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act was transferred to me under the Administrative Arrangements Order published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette of the 23rd February 1978.

* When arrangements are completed, all Social **Security** pensioners will be advised and invited to take advantage of the new payment method.

* The safety and **security** of Australia and of the waterways around it are necessarily of deep concern to all in this country who seek its maximum protection.

* However, because of the determination of the honourable member, who was Minister for Social **Security** at the time, to continue to waste public funds because adequate provision was not made to support Commonwealth Employment Service offices, I think this question comes rather oddly from him.

* A whole group of these organisations were analysed in this study which was reported in the  Social **Security** Bulletin  of May 1976.

* If so, how does he account for the fact that the Department of Social **Security** estimates show that the allocation of funds for unemployment benefits this year is $9.

* Secondly, wallowing in false **security** as a result of Britain's delayed entry into the Common Market, the Australian economy was not encouraged to move towards adjustment as quickly and as early as it should have been to respond to the changed trading circumstances which would eventually arise when Britain went into the Common Market.

* IBM 360/65- $2.6m (this includes a notional cost of $1.3m for the acquisition, on transfer, of certain equipment from the Departments of Health and Social **Security**); 
I should think that the second reasonable thing that the funds could have done would have been to propose to the Department of Social **Security** reduced contributions levels in the hospital tables.

* I stress this point, which is very important, and I hope that the Minister for Social **Security** will do what he can to ensure that the public will get back the money which is left over in these funds and which contributors have been forced to pay for so many years.

* (Quorum formed) The Department of Social **Security** has now told the funds that they should not collect medical contributions to cover periods after 1 July.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 8 November 1978: 
Will the Government consider liberalising the means test for unemployed persons currently at $6 per week for a married couple, after which the benefit is reduced on a dollar for dollar earned basis, to bring it in line with the means test for other social **security** benefits; if not, why not.

* He did not mention health, social **security**, education or pensions.

* Social **security**, education and health are the traditional areas where the Opposition, when it was in government, always economised.

* All those people dependent on social **security**, aU those charitable and voluntary organisations who care for dependants should have a good look at the Liberal Budget alternatives.

* It was always the philosophy of the former Government when it came to handing out increases for social **security**, for repatriation, for sickness, for invalid and for unemployment benefits to look at what was available and never to look at the needs.

* Library services in foreign languages are seen also as part of community education insofar as it relates to migrants, and this functionally is the responsibility of the Department of Social **Security**.

* In the meantime my Department is maintaining contact with both the Committee of Inquiry and the Department of Social **Security**.

* As Australia's grant includes $49m for the employment **security** scheme for expatriate Australian public servants who are losing their jobs because of Papua New Guinea's independence, it is even less than it appears.

* 1 priority because it will increase the **security** and efficiency of the farmers in this area.

* I know that it would give the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and this Government great satisfaction if there were a considerable diversification of the services that are made use of under this Act.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said: 'This Government is presiding over the destruction of the Australian economy'.

* The Government, along with all other mortals in this country, cannot predict the future - yet it is willing to gamble with this nation':) **security** by predicting that the future will be free of the need to involve our armed Services in significant combat for the next 15 years.

* Did the Minister for Social **Security** publicly express an opinion that reserve funds of health insurance organisations should not be used for political purposes because they were collected for health purposes and may be subscribed by people who do not support the party being assisted?

* I am not aware of the difficulty to which he refers, but I shall certainly convey his concern to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* But I can assure the honourable member that the Commonwealth would like to see these coalfields developed because not only would this mean more job opportunities and **security** for the people in the coal industry but it would also mean more export revenue for the Government.

* Article 7 of the Philippines Agreement, that is, Article 6 of the Model and Finland texts, weakened the physical **security** provisions by taking away requirements of earlier texts for review and updating.

* I should have thought that its critical implications for the future of South Vietnam due to the full-scale invasion by the North were self evident and that its critical implications for the future **security** of Australia would have been obvious to everyone.

* The second point is that this has been brought about by aggression from the north, and the third is that this combination of circumstances has serious implications for the **security** of Australia.

* This House should closely examine the implications for the future **security** of this country of the previously demonstrated links between events and policies concerning the notorious Victorian Branch of the ALP and statements by leading members of the Federal Parliamentary Australian Labor Party.

* In these circumstances,  Mr Speaker,  I feel that the House is entitled to hear from the Government its attitude to the present situation in South Vietnam and how it regards the situation in relation to Australia's **security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* My question, addressed to the Acting Attorney-General, arises from a question asked yesterday by the honourable member for Macquarie of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* But as a matter of immediacy I think we should use all the agencies at our disposal, including the Commonwealth and State Police and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, to attempt to identify the offenders among the extremist groups and to bring them to justice.

* -In addressing the Chair after Question Time today, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  questioned the accuracy of the  Hansard  report of a speech made by the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Goodluck)  last night on a motion by the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  concerning social **security** and repatriation benefits.

* Near the end of the speech of the honourable member for Franklin the  Hansard  report, at page 2 1 9, read: 
Is the Government concerned about the industrial atmosphere at Garden Island from a national **security** viewpoint; if so, what action is proposed by the Government.

* I rise to answer briefly a few of the words of criticism directed by the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  at the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Firstly, I think it can be said quite clearly that no Minister in the history of this Parliament has brought more real social justice to the administration of the portfolio of social services or social **security** than has the present Minister.

* In fact, the Minister for Social **Security** has lifted the rate of the single pension from a little above 20 per cent of average weekly earnings to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, and he has done so in the 20 months that he has held office.

* The present Minister for Social **Security** has feeling and compassion.

* On matters of some internal politics, the honourable member has always shown a deep consideration, particularly in the administration of social **security**.

* I know that he worked particularly hard with a rather regressive government which could not understand the priorities he wanted to bring forward in the social **security** field.

* He cannot deny the fact that in the short period of 20 months in which he has held the portfolio, the present Minister for Social **Security**, in a very difficult inflationary time, has been able to lift the rate of the single pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* First, he attacked personally the Minister for Social **Security** who in fact has made a real contribution to this Parliament.

* He has been one of the great Australian Ministers responsible for social services or social **security**.

* There is a wealth of things to discuss in the field of parliamentary democracy - new concepts in race relations, Commonwealth and world **security** and so on.

* This morning the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  moved a most important censure motion against the Government and the Government has shown its attitude to the Opposition and to private members of this Parliament by gagging that first and most vital censure motion over the manner in which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  summoned certain selected Pressmen into his office and gave them **security** information.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** been drawn to newspaper reports of likely chaos in private nursing homes because of probable substantial increases in costs arising from the impending wage increases?

* Another matter which the Committee examined was the fraudulent issue and negotiation of cheques at a regional office of the Department of Social Services, now the Department of Social **Security**.

* The remaining components are:  physical **security**; safeguard provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards.

* It is the message to the  President  to the United Nations **Security** Council from the permanent representative of Cambodia to the United Nations.

* It states: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-Because of the concern expressed in Victoria over the proposed Medibank scheme, can the Minister for Social **Security** advise the House what stage has been reached in negotiations with the Minister for Health or the Premier in Victoria regarding Medibank?

* Additional **security** arrangements estimated to cost $20,000 should be provided.

* The Government accepts the recommendation that additional **security** arrangements be provided and consideration will be given to this aspect in the development of the project.

* Reciprocal Agreement on Social **Security**  (Question No.

* It will improve facilities for local communities; it will give some return to the community for taxes paid and revenue used to pay unemployment benefits insofar as money expended will be in lieu of unemployment benefits, and it will sieve out those who are termed 'dole bludgers' in that if they do not accept work they will not get social **security** payments.

* I am very proud that he did so, but why does he not get the support of his Party and ensure assurance and **security** for the workers who have gone back to Mary Kathleen?

* Except for minor dissents all differences have been resolved in a real attempt to produce a substantial contribution to the national interest and to the future **security** of Australia.

* I thank honourable members on both sides of the House for the contributions they have made to the debate on the estimates for the Department of Health, the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

* The first of these is the establishment of a high **security** quarantine treatment unit- the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital in Melbourne.

* The Government will construct also a high **security** off-shore animal quarantine station on Cocos (Keeling) Islands at a cost of $6.9m.

* The Government was very concerned that many nursing home patients and their families throughout Australia were having great difficulty in meeting the enormous gap between the fees to be paid and the benefits payable, but under the new arrangement the Government has brought a new era of **security** to nursing home patients and their families.

* I have received a number of letters of gratitude from them and I know that they accept it as a new era of **security**.

* The home is basic to the **security** of just about every one of us.

* Is the  Deputy  Prime Minister aware that stores in Melbourne and Sydney have been forced to put up shutters, employ **security** guards and have extra plate glass oh hand in case of violence at this insane Moratorium demonstration today?

* The honourable member for Fraser, who as I have mentioned was a delegate with me to the Australian Parliamentary Association's conference in Mauritius, reported that during the United Nations **Security** Council debate the Australian mission played a low key role and sought not to embarrass Indonesia.

* After its  invasion on  7 December last year the Indonesian Government treated the angry reaction of the UN, and in particular the resolutions of the **Security** Council, with scant regard.

* In 2 separate resolutions the **Security** Council called on Indonesia to withdraw her troops and to provide for an acceptable act of self-determination.

* I will talk with my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**, and if there is any merit in the suggestion it will be adopted.

* I ask a question of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* In the past the Commissioner has not had power to grant an extension of time for payment except upon sufficient **security** for payment.

* I will make sure that the request from the honourable member is passed on to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* In view of this profit level and the **security** obtained by long term contracts negotiated by this Government, does the criticism by  Sir Norman  Giles of the Government's attitude towards the rural industries suggest some inconsistencies on his part?

* The main concern of finance companies is to lend money, and provided they have sufficient **security** to cover the indebtedness they could not care 2 hoots.

* I think that in some ways a more psychologically damaging recession is occurring at this moment, not because it is more serious than the recession in the 1930s in its effect upon people but because it has arrived after a long period during which people have become accustomed to **security**, full employment and all the rest of it.

* We have done pretty well in giving migrants access to social **security** benefits, to some kinds of work and to schools.

* We probably would get the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to look at them for some mysterious reason.

* Has the Minister used all means available to convince the South Australian Labor Premier and his Government and the Labor Opposition in this House that this waste of time represents a disregard for **security**, production and national development?

* Has the Minister for Social **Security** seen a statement by the Liberal Party spokesman on health that upon the implementation of the Government's health insurance scheme, there will be an immediate shortage of 900 beds in Melboure alone?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
This Bill gives effect to the Government's proposals to update certain repatriation benefits, and will show the continuing recognition of our responsibility to those who made such a valuable contribution to the **security** of our country.

* Is it true that in 10 years time, when, as the Minister has stated, a threat to Australia's **security** could well be imminent, these cadets would have been executive officers in the naval forces but for the termination of their appointments?

* The open air collection of luggage, the open air assembly of passengers, the exposure to all elements and the general congestion and total lack of **security** are most undesirable.

* Insofar as this can be done within the limits of intelligence **security**, will the Minister have prepared for the information of honourable members a report showing the increase in the conventional armed forces of the Soviet Union during recent times and the nature, extent and location of Soviet armed forces distinguishing, as far as possible, between conventional and non-conventional weaponry?

* That all words after That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House is of opinion that provision should have been made (a) for the effective period of service to be 6 years, (b) for the concessions granted to single or widowed female members of the Forces without dependants to be granted also to single or widowed male members of the Forces without dependants and (c) for amendments to be made to the principal Act in respect of the title to the dwelling-house, unit or lot to enable the serviceman to borrow on second mortgage and give valid **security** to the lender".

* While I am dealing with social **security** matters I wish to refer to another issue.

* and (2) This Government adheres to the policy established by the former Prime Minister  Mr Chifley  in 1949 and followed by successive Governments since that time that details of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation or its operations are not disclosed.

* I assume that the Honourable Member has in mind the recommendation in the Molomby Report that a cheque given by a consumer to a credit provider as **security** should b e made non-transferable.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
-My question to the Minister for Defence is supplementary to the one asked by one of his supporters on Tuesday last relating to the able seaman who has been charged with an offence relating to the damage of aircraft at Nowra.

* Are we to understand that despite the many senior officers of the Navy whose duties are to look after **security**, particularly in respect of the extensive damage in the Nowra fire, that the only person deemed to be liable is an able seaman aged 19 years?

* I note that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who is probably not the Minister who will speak on this Bill, stated in his second reading speech- he was then the acting Treasurer- that there is no good reason why Territory employers should not be called on to meet taxes and charges comparable with those borne by employers in the States.

* The Opposition is well aware of the problems of **security** in the present day environment and the problems presented by the structure of this building.

* It is also a fact that there are **security** connotations which prevent us from discussing the project in this place.

* Not only in that field is their relevance to the comments of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden);  these is also a company called Marrickville Margarine Pty Ltd.

* It is utter poppycock for the Minister for Social **Security**, who preceded me, to suggest that the forms of assistance that have enabled the growth of the great primary industries of this country were in operation only because of the interests of the Country Party.

* Is it a fact that the loan to **security** ratio was about 83 per cent, whilst the law applying to loans from finance companies, solicitors and trustee company funds provides a maximum loan to **security** ratio of 66% per cent?

However, to have the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation involved in the question whether people are seeking to promote hatred is quite undesirable.

* -Australia is a member of the **Security** Council, and our representative there,  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre is using his best endeavours to bring the contending parties together.

* The Commission can prohibit trading only in a specified **security**, not in the lot, and that can be overriden by the Government.

* to act as an agent for the Department of Social **Security** in relation to the administration of certain provisions of the Social Services Act 1947-1975, particularly in the issue and receipt of claim forms and first income statements for unemployment benefit and in the administration of the 'work test' which is the system used to determine whether suitable employment is available for a claimant or recipient of unemployment benefit.

* Although I would anticipate that they would be used only rarely, except perhaps at the instigation of organisations which might apply to have a fund wound up, I believe that contributors should have the **security** of such provisions under arrangements deliberately designed to achieve universal health insurance.

* Therefore I say it is pure common sense, as a defence measure, to see that at least we have that **security**.

* Reference was made earlier to the question of the accounts under examination of **security** organisations such as the Joint Intelligence Organisation, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Service, the Commonwealth Police, and so on.

* There are quite good and perfectly valid **security** reasons why such accounts should not be subject to public scrutiny in the Parliament.

* From the Commonwealth's point of view virtually the whole range of Commonwealth services are housed there, including the Australian Taxation Office for the whole of north Queensland, the Commonwealth Employment Service and an office of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The vast improvements to the lives of so many Australians brought about by the intervention of government in Health schemes, social **security** programs, welfare housing and so on are ignored.

* Australians are lulled into a false sense of **security**.

* As the House well knows, this change was debated simultaneously with the social **security** change on 10 October or 12 October last year and came into force on 1 November.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 June 1978: 
1 ) Is it a fact that the Department of Social **Security**, Manual of Instructions, Section 7, subsection 101, issued March 1978, states that the test whether a person is selfemployed or unemployed is applied realistically.

* It is a crisis which eats away at the **security** of every Australian, at our confidence and at our way of life.

* Far from improving the **security** of our South Pacific region, by action of appeasement it in fact will aggravate the position in the years which lie ahead.

* Remember, the whole thesis of the Indonesian approach to East Timor was that it was vital in the interests of international **security** that Indonesia, on the basis of its own subjective judgment, should send over 29,000 troops into East Timor.

* Well, I will bet London to a brick that none of those three people came out of the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Commonwealth Social **Security** Department or - 
-The honourable member for Barker is trying to deny what I am saying.

* It has pressed down on those who are receiving their social **security** benefits.

* For goodness sake, with the highest unemployment rate that we have had in this country for 40 years or more, with more people seeking social **security** because of the actions of this Government, how does this Government solve the situation?

* It is important that he sees the RED scheme as being really an extension of social **security**.

* It has merit as an extension of social **security** in these difficult times but it is not aimed at curbing unemployment as such.

* Are **security** files kept on all Members of the Australian Parliament, either by the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation or by other agencies.

* I will refer the matter to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* This Act is administered by the Federal Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Federal Minister for Social **Security** becomes the legal guardian of such children until they are adopted, marry, leave Australia permanently or attain the age of 18 years or are otherwise exempted.

* As the guardian of immigrant children, the Federal Minister for Social **Security** has the same rights, powers, duties, obligations and liabilities as a natural guardian.

* Since 1952, by agreement with the State and Territory authorities, those powers and functions of guardianship of the Federal Minister for Social **Security** under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, have been delegated to the principal officers of the relevant State and Territory child welfare authorities excepting the power of delegation.

* However, at present, by administrative arrangement, where adoption, marriage or departure from Australia are involved, the matter is referred by delegates with the appropriate recommendation to the Department of Social **Security** in Canberra for the Minister's consideration.

* This recommendation is examined by officers of the Department of Social **Security** as a matter of urgency to ensure that it is in order and that any other issues which may affect the Commonwealth have been resolved before they make a recommendation to the Minister.

* The applications are dealt with by the Department of Social **Security** as expeditiously as possible, but it must be borne in mind that there is frequently a need to consult other departments and some delays may occur.

* When this is completed, it is the practice for the Minister for Social **Security** to sign personally an Order exempting the child from the provisions of the Act to enable the adoption applications to be resolved by due legal or administrative process in accordance with the legislation of the State or Territory concerned.

* Subject to the agreement of State authorities which has now been obtained, new procedures will be introduced which give State and Territory authorities, power as delegates of the Federal Minister for Social **Security** to exempt a child from the provisions of the Act without reference to the Federal Minister.

* This will enable child welfare authorities to take all the necessary action in connection with adoption, marriage or departure from Australia without the necessity of referring the matter to the Federal Minister for Social **Security** unless there are exceptional circumstances.

* The Federal Minister for Social **Security** will, of course, retain overall responsibility for the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act and the actions taken by the delegates under that Act.

* The changes in the administrative procedures do not imply any lessening of interest in adoption matters, nor of concern for the children for whom the Minister for Social **Security** remains the legal guardian.

* To ensure that the children's welfare is safeguarded, the Minister for Social **Security** has requested that child welfare authorities continue to refer for attention, matters of an unusual nature or where malpractices occur, and has asked to be kept informed on a regular basis of the number of children in their State or Territory who are known to come within the provisions of that Act or are exempted therefrom.

* Does each of these provisions apply to the Minister for Social **Security**, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Administrative Services with regard to the handling of the conspiracy case involving Greeks, in particular the Nakis pardon and the request for an ex-gratia reward payment?

* It could be the beginning of repatriation matters being taken over by the social **security** administration.

* He obviously looks to the **security** of the institution he represents.

* Secondly, he looks to the **security** he enjoys as an official in that institution and at the wage he might gain and maintain in that position.

* Honourable members will recall that I have mentioned, amongst the factors motivating the union executive, his tendency to look to his **security** in the union he represents and also to the wage he might gain and maintain in that position.

* A worker would have added **security** of employment within his trade or within related trades which would all be under the same union, so that if there was a recession in one area of the industry, the employee could move much more easily to another area within the same union.

* Can the Minister for Immigration give an assurance that **security** and screening processes will be applied to prospective migrants from Arab countries to ensure that Australia is kept free from the activities of Arab terrorists?

* Will the Prime Minister now tell the House in precise terms why his Attorney-General undertook the raids on the Canberra office and Melbourne headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, or does the Prime Minister intend in this House and elsewhere to continue to hide behind the evasion and prevarications of the Attorney-General, who is now so clearly discredited by this whole affair?

* Since then, the extensive use of motor cars, the extension of automatic telephone service and the withdrawal of social **security** payments from post offices have resulted in many of these small rural post offices being by-passed by the local residents.

* The Minister for Social **Security** and I made it abundantly plain last week that there would be the usual increases in social service payments and the due reduction in the age limit for the means test this session.

* This Government is proceeding as quickly as it can to remedy serious defects in the Social **Security** System.

* More money has been turned towards education, social **security** and the promotion of healthy, whole individuals and better communities and community relations.

* We said that far more attention would be paid to children than the previous government had ever dreamed about since it was here that the future of 
**Security**, upon notice: 
-The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade will be aware of the great concern and apprehension felt by sugar producers and supporting communities at recent threatening trends in market prospects.

* Will he inform the House whether the International Sugar Agreement decisions will have the effect of bringing **security** and prosperity to the Australian sugar industry?

* The Committee also suggests that Aboriginals make greater use of provisions of the Social Services Act to ensure that basic necessities such as food and clothing are provided to families instead of social **security** benefits being squandered on alcohol.

* In view of the vast publicity given to the recent arrests of persons for alleged social **security** frauds, what steps has the Minister taken to assure the Greek community that prosecutions directed at individuals do not imply condemnation of that community as a whole and to thank those members of the community who did their duty and assisted the authorities with their inquiries?

* Sombody has been kind enough to bring to my attention words spoken by  Senator Guilfoyle,  now Minister for Social **Security**.

* At page 195 1 of  Hansard  for 28 May 1975 she is recorded as saying: 
Departments represented on the Task Group are Environment, Housing and Community Development (Chair), Aboriginal Affairs, Education, Employment and Industrial Relations, Finance, Health, Home Affairs (Office of Women's Affairs), Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Social **Security**.

* In view of this speech, I ask the Prime Minister whether the ANZUS treaty can be regarded as still having the strength and **security** which a credible defence policy for Australia demands?

* It is difficult also to get quick results in other areas- for example, social **security**, where it is necessary to settle principles on which discussions and negotiations for agreements with other countries might proceed.

* Until there is substantial opportunity for industrial employment there seems to be little point in taking children through the schools, so that in the end they have lost whatever they had of their Aboriginal culture and they have obtained no key to **security** in non-Aboriginal society.

* The shrewd people can lend money on .**security**, and in turn they know that if the venture is a good one - and they have every reason to believe it will be - they can come in, not as the ordinary investor who buys his shares on the stock exchange at the current market price, but, in the good Australian phrase, on the grouter.

* The Party policy, the Government's policy, is a summary of United Nations **Security** Council resolution 242.

* Honourable members will remember that when the last conflict arose the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations was President of the **Security** Council.

* Having said that, I believe that for the safety and **security** of this country there are times when an election should be held.

* This must be done, as I say, for the sake of the safety and **security** of this country even when it means that an election is held at a time when the party elected to power has had a shorter period in office than the term for which it was elected.

* Will the Prime Minister assure the House that good Australian citizens who have fled their homeland will not come under political charges on advice from a foreign power without such advice being weighed against information from Australia's own **security** and police forces?

* A fair tax system, a good social **security** system,  a  reform of the tariff structure, control of restrictive practices, an appropriate exchange rate, the setting of norms as a guide for public and for private employers, informal public adjustments of rent and interest charges are directed to making our existing social system work better.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
It is my understanding that the action taken by the **security** officers in the instance of the Croatians referred to in the first part of the honourable gentleman's question was taken on the premise that he suggested.

* As to any action to be taken by **security** officers in respect of  Mr George  Crawford and others, I have no understanding or knowledge of the position, nor would I expect to have any.

* This year, the world has witnessed the long awaited European **Security** Conference, which has formalised the deal made by the superpowers at the end of World War II.

* He worte: 
I do not wish to disparage the gains made to Europe and to the whole world by the European **Security** Conference, but I cannot resist the idea that if the countries of eastern and western Europe had been allowed to determine their own future rather than to have it imposed upon them by outside powers, the European **Security** Conference might never have been necessary.

* Whether it is because or in spite of the European **Security** Conference I do not know, but it looks as if Europe will continue to be divided into 2 armed camps for a long time yet.

* The Indonesians allegedly see an independent Timor as a threat to their **security**.

* It will ensure more jobs and more job **security** in that industry.

* Under the scheme the Government is introducing he would be entitled, over the period that he may live and up to 65 years of age when social **security** payments take over, to receive $1 14,300, so he would be far better off with his 85 per cent disability under the Government's scheme.

* In what ways would the submission of his Department to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works concerning the establishment of a high **security** offshore quarantine station in 1973, have to be changed in the light of subsequent developments in artificial insemination, ova transplants, and disease control and recognition.

* 1 ask the Minister for Social **Security** whether he is aware of the financial hardship caused to parents of children over the age of 16 years receiving the invalid pension and needing costly nursing care at home.

* Can the Minister for Social **Security** give an assurance that those people who have been convinced by him that they do not need to be covered by a hospital benefit fund will receive a bed in a public ward of a hospital when they need it?

* For the information of honourable members I present the final report of the Darwin Disaster Welfare Council dated March 1976, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for Social **Security** relating to that report.

* Reciprocal Agreements on Social **Security**  (Question No.

* 1932) 
1 ) My Department has confirmed with New Zealand veterinary authorities that the scrapie outbreak in that country occurred only in imported sheep in the New Zealand high **security** animal quarantine station at Somes Island.

* If so, will the Treasurer remind State Premiers at the next Premiers Conference of their true position in the economic area and the need to contain expenditure for the long term **security** of our nation even though such a policy which is absolutely responsible may be unpopular in the short term?

* The young people of Australia in future will be denied all the **security**, freedom of choice and expresson, and stable family life which are a direct product of home ownership, and which most Australians have grown to accept as of right.

* He would be conscious of the **security** and the well-being that come with home ownership.

* In the field of social **security**, children's allowances have been completely forgotten by the Government, as have tertiary allowances.

* To whom were Army Units used in the recent civil **security** operations responsible.

* The practice of declining to answer questions concerning the activities of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation was commenced by Prime Minister Chifley in 1949 and has been followed by every Government since.

* The Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** recommended that the present practice, whereby the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the ASIO Act do not confirm or deny allegations, or presumed allegations, in respect of ASIO, continue in force' (Fourth Report, Volume I, paragraph 78 1 ).

* As  Dr Evatt  said in the House of Representatives in 1949 'The **Security** Service must be operated with secrecy in order properly to protect the community '.

* The honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  who was Minister for Social **Security** at the time, persuaded all the people involved that it ought to be done.

* I am suffering from the same problem as the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who was leading for the Government in the previous 2 Bills; we have the tiger of the watch upon us.

* I wish to deal with four main headings: Firstly, the economy; secondly, social **security**; thirdly, defence and foreign affairs; and fourthly, the bitter alternative that would otherwise be provided by the Labor Party and that will be completely rejected by the Australia people.

* I would now like to turn to social **security**.

* I particularly want to lay to rest the myth that the Labor Party has a mortgage over social **security** advancement.

* So much for the disgraceful attitude of the Labor Party to social **security**!

* The program of decentralisation of office representation of the Department of Social **Security** is currently being reviewed, but I can assure the honourable member - although I cannot talk specifically about the town or city of Taree - that much greater emphasis will be placed on the needs of people in urban areas, which needs by and large have been neglected in the past insofar as the decentralisation of office representation of the Department of Social **Security** has been concerned.

* Perhaps the Department of Social **Security** should have been more involved than it was concerning the social scar that could result.

* There will be no **security** for the Aboriginal people of Yarrabah until we have taken steps to secure their land for them - 
My question is addressed to the Prime Minister.

* The Prime Minister has said that the record of conversation made by  Sir John  Bunting and by his own principal private secretary  Dr Wilenski  bears out the Prime Minister's statement that no complaint was made to the Prime Minister by the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation on 17 March last concerning the events of the day before, 16 March.

* I also recognise that this Bill is vitally important to the very **security** of this nation.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is being given, by this legislation, a very unique role in this country.

* It can lead to persons or groups being persecuted for beliefs which are really not of the type that would endanger the **security** of this nation.

* The tragedy is that Opposition members had developed such a paranoia over so many years about what ASIO supposedly represented, that in Launceston in 1971 the person who was later to be the responsible Minister  (Senator Murphy)  had to defend the very right of a **security** organisation to exist.

* Indeed, the history of ASIO goes back to 1949 when the then Prime Minister sent a letter to  Mr Justice  Reed appointing him Director-General of **Security** and requesting him to establish and operate a **security** service.

* The first Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act was passed in 1956.

* I acknowledge that the Organisation, by virtue of clause 5 of the ASIO Bill, is to be responsible for ensuring that there are no activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth.

* I am not saying that those at the very top should be endangered in any way by a lessening of surveillance, but I am saying that we should avoid getting into the situation which we have witnessed in the United States of America and in other countries- I do not necessarily accept the views of the previous  speaker  that Australia is already at that stage- and avoid ever reaching that stage of bringing our **security** organisation into disrepute, we should now build into this Act those measures which will ensure that members from both sides of the House, whilst they may not necessarily be aware of everything, at least trust the organisation.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 14 September 1978: 
State in the United States on the size of the Russian presence.

* For example, we have a  Mr Spiers,  the Director of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs in the Department of State making a statement in July 1971 at a hearing before the SubCommittee on National **Security** Policy and Scientific Development.

* There was some discussion last year and prior to that as to whether the power over internal **security** should pass to Papua New Guinea on self-government.

* It was thought that the power over external affairs and defence would naturally remain with the metropolitan power - the administering authority - but that it may be wise to retain some area of responsibility over internal **security**.

* I did not necessarily subscribe to that view but in any case the Government has adopted the attitude - the Government has not put it to us but we have had to glean it from a number of remarks - that internal **security** and the power over internal **security** will pass to Papua New Guinea during the period from selfgovernment to independence or prior to 1 December.

* There is no hard and fast rule of constitutional practice, as I understand it, concerning the timing of the transfer of responsibility for internal **security**.

* In most former British dependencies the British Government, through the Governor, retained ultimate responsibility for internal **security** up until the time of independence itself, but whatever arrangements were arrived at prior to that date seem to have been based upon the particular situation in each dependency.

* He said then: 
While Australia would remain responsible for the Territory's defence and external affairs, arrangements might be made for sharing of some police and internal **security** matters between the Governments of the Territory and Australia.

* I would like the Minister to advise this House of the details of the transfer of responsibility over internal **security**.

* We must be advised of the study of arrangements deemed necessary by this Government at selfgovernment for the maintenance of internal **security** as a local responsibility.

* I do not know whether the Director-General of **Security** made a record of conversation.

* In view of the answers that he has given to the Leader of the Opposition and in view of the reference which he made to the existence of a Senate committee, will he- make available to that Senate committee an authenticated copy of the telex sent from the Canberra office of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to other branches of ASIO on 28 March?

* The passage of the legislation by the Australian and State governments will provide the industry with the **security** afforded by orderly marketing and stabilisation while arrangements for the future are being formulated.

* The first one concerns the question of Australia's needs, the future **security** of overseas sources and the likely world demand for softwood products.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security**: In addition to his comprehensive program for social welfare will he give urgent consideration to the problems of families, and the need to provide increased family assistance so that mothers will not be compelled by economic circumstances to seek employment which would disadvantage her children?

* I have a message-I mean I have a question, and it is without notice, for the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I shall get the appropriate answer in detail for the honourable gentleman from the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Department has, over a long period of time, been able to hide behind excessive secrecy and lack of parliamentary scrutiny on the grounds- quite often improperly- of **security** considerations.

* There was a crucial question to be addressed this year in framing the Defence budget, and it was this: Could we defer some of the defence development provisionally proposed for 1978-79, without there being a serious effect on the **security** which the defence program is designed to afford to the nation now and in the future?

* Social **Security** accounts for 28 per cent of budget outlays, the most important form of Government spending.

* In addition there have been 19 Mirage modifications and 2 Macchi modifications which have not been listed for **security** reasons.

* and (3) Consideration is being given to the establishment of an Australian high **security** animal quarantine station, one of the purposes of which would be to facilitate the importation of new strain!, of animal genetic material without risk of introducing exotic animal diseases.

* In view of the Prime Minister's reply, from which I gathered that ministerial staffs are not required to have **security** clearances, on what basis does he see the distinction between the clearance now required of new recruits into the Public Service and the non-clearance apparently required of recruits to ministerial staffs?

* Who was it who made an unprecedented and indefensible raid on the office of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and who supported and defended that action?

* -I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is it a fact that in his Department there is a section in which documents and papers about East Timor and Indonesia are kept under triple or high **security** because they are highly embarrassing to Indonesia?

* He mentioned that we needed offices of the Postmaster-General's Department, the Department of Labour, the Department of Health, the Department of Services and Property, the Department of Social **Security** and the Taxation Office in the electorate of Parramatta.

* Questions relating to recipients of unemployment benefit should be directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Another way in which to reduce public expenditure so that it is a smaller percentage of gross domestic product would be to let these people net out these payments in their income tax returns and pay the net difference on the basis that we recognise that, because of age, those people are entitled to the social **security** benefits which they are now receiving.

* I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are a large number of ex-servicemen who have been denied war service home entitlements on the basis that their land tenure under the New South Wales Lands Act was deemed to be insufficient, or that the **security** was not adequate.

* There is adequate **security** on the basis of leasehold tenure, particularly if it is converted on a terms basis, because every other lending authority in New South Wales, and I would say every such authority in Australia, lends money on that same title.

* The worst feature of this matter is to be found in what the  Deputy  Director said: 
I made representations to the Under Secretary of Lands in New South Wales and said: 'Why is it that you cannot get an adequate amendment to your own New South Wales legislation or make a forceful submission to the Government at Canberra in order to get a quick amendment to the War Service Homes Act so that any tenure deemed to be sufficient under the New South Wales Crown Lands Consolidation Act is adequate **security** for an exserviceman?'

* The obvious thing to do in this case is to amend this Act quickly so that any tenure granted under the New South Wales Crown Lands Consolidation Act is adequate **security** provided the term of the tenure is sufficient to meet the repayments under the war service homes administration.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 October 1977: 
am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 4 April 1 978: 
What progress has been made in negotiating the comprehensive reciprocal agreements on social **security**.

* Would there be any advantage in introducing a new public **security** on a limited basis with an inflation-adjusted capital value or floating interest rate?

* **Security**, upon notice: 
by leave -  Mr Speaker, His Excellency  the Governor-General has already foreshadowed major changes in the Government's health insurance programme during this Parliament.

* With this clear objective and on the firm foundation of schemes introduced by previous Liberal-Country Party Governments, we have already made great advances in providing **security** against the cost of illness - advances of which this Government is justifiably proud.

* It has also contributed significantly to the **security** of life in floodprone areas.

* Australia already has comprehensive reciprocal agreements on social **security** with Britain and New Zealand.

* The Prime Minister will recall telling me on Thursday last that I had failed in my duty to see what were the terms and conditions under which the DirectorGeneral of Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation was appointed.

* So that the House may know those terms and conditions on which the Prime Minister and the AttorneyGeneral so heavily rely to establish the legality of the Attorney-General's action in raiding 
The Minister for Social **Security** is here, I believe.

* Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  who in answer to a question which I suspect he arranged endeavoured to indicate to the House that during the period of time when I was Prime Minister the lot of the pensioner deteriorated or was not properly taken care of.

* **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in reply will try to give some final costing figure.

* If a young woman under 1 8 years arrives in Australia other than in the care of a relative or is not joining a relative who will accept responsibility for her, legal guardianship is vested in my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security** under the provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act.

* -I ask the Minister Assisting the Minister for Social **Security**: What action can the Australian Government take to prevent the heartless, callous and iniquitous practice being followed by some general practitioners in demanding payment in advance, at rates oftentimes in excess of the scheduled fee, from invalid and age pensioners before they will provide medical attention?

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Bill must be seen as another step forward in the implementation of the Australian Labor Party's comprehensive social **security** program based on the philosophy that society has an obligation to provide adequately for citizens who for any reason cannot take care of themselves or those dependent on them.

* It is also necessary that any social **security** payments should be tied to average weekly earnings, including increments, to ensure that the persons receiving benefits will receive automatic increases as productivity increases, as other factors increase general prosperity, or as inflation occurs.

* I know that the Minister for Social **Security** is currently having discussions with her State counterparts in respect to the child care program, which also includes pre-schools.

* Also, a proposal was made to create a new development **security** facility in the IMF, with substantial resources, to stabilise export earnings of developing countries.

* Referring to the migrant settlement services that are available in this country and which are administered largely by the Department of Social **Security**, the Green Paper, in the same chapter dealing with 'Society and the migrant', at page 55, puts this view: 
-It is correct, of course, that we have special safes in the Department for holding highly classified documents.

* I would like to follow that question further down the line but it being the subject of highly classified information dealing with **security** and intelligence matters, the honourable member will be aware that precedent dictates- which I accept- that I cannot comment one way or the other on such highly classified documents.

* He is a man who built his dream home- the home that was to be his castle, that was to give him **security**.

* -Has the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs seen a report alleging that the Government has failed to honour its obligations in accordance with the United Nations **Security** Council resolution in relation to Rhodesia; that it is in fact admitting Rhodesians contrary to that resolution; and that the Government is using its program for the entry of IndoChinese refugees as a means of legitimising entry of Rhodesians?

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Is it a fact that social **security** benefits are not adjusted in accordance with movements in the consumer price index whereas pensions are so adjusted.

* But speaking in a less broad context about economic policy, the 1977-78 Budget specifically introduced tax cuts and upheld the health, education, defence and social **security** budgets in very difficult times.

* there being no **security** of tenure for residents living on the Balranald Reserve.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-Has the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to a court case before  Mr Justice  Nagle in Parramatta, New South Wales, in March of this year in which 3 men were convicted of murdering Dieter Bergmann on 20 September 1974 at Liverpool, New South Wales?

* Has he noted the evidence that Bergmann was a member of an organisation formed to overthrow the Government of Australia and was killed by three of his fellow members because he was considered to be a **security** risk to this organisation?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
But there also has to be some protection for the journalist and some freedom to print.

* There is a tendency to regard news as being a **security** matter.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 August 1979: 
Will the Minister bring up to date the answer of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Question No.

* 128 concerning reciprocal agreements on social **security**  (Hansard,  8 March 1978, page 571).

* -The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  made a more rational endeavour than did the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  to explain away the Government's economic policies.

* It will be interesting to compare the words of the Minister for Social **Security** with the Budget when the Budget is before us.

* It is very natural for people who suddenly find that their whole way of life and their financial **security** is threatened to resent bitterly the actions of those whom they see as being responsible for their predicament.

* The country can only hope that he possesses the negotiating ability to extricate the Government from this fiasco with as little financial loss as possible and with a suitable alternative fighter-bomber to assure Australia's **security**.

* the best for our purposes, our **security**-  and note the last part -  and the mcn who will fly them.

* Vietnamese **security** forces throughout Vietnam.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* There are no defence or **security** implications in an inter-departmental committee report on revaluation compensation.

* One of the first things I did when I became Minister for Social **Security** was, for instance, to amend the regulations so that in a situation in which a mother is in a maternity ward of a hospital with an infant child who is under 10 days old and requires intensive treatment that child is covered for medical and hospital benefit purposes.

* Under the administration of a succession of conservative governments- 
1 ) The Working Party on Medical and Surgical Aids and Appliances has a membership of nine comprising six senior officers of the Department of Health (one of whom is Chairman), two of the Department of Social **Security** and one of the Department of Repatriation and Compensation.

* Is it a fact that the Minister for Social **Security** has appointed  Ms Eva  Learner to the Social Welfare Commission as a Welfare Education Consultant to provide advice on curriculum in the context of educational programs developed within institutes such as universities, colleges of advanced education and technical colleges, concerning training for social work.

* There should be a full inquiry into this matter by the  Speaker  or the Privileges Committee, and perhaps I had better get the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation along to give them a hand.

* During the course of the last year we have taken a number of necessary steps to re-establish a firm basis and **security** within the Australian economy.

* Otherwise there are no **security** constraints upon visitors.

* Although the decision as to who is to be regarded as disadvantaged has been left to individual doctors, the Minister for Health has suggested to all doctors that persons on low incomes, including social **security**, unemployment, sickness or special beneficiaries could be included in this category.

* - Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Bill, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1979 and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Amendment Bill 1979, as they are related measures.

* -Has the Minister for Social **Security** noted an article on Medibank in today's 'Sydney Morning Herald' by John O'Hara?

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice:

* Representatives of a meeting which took place outside Parliament House met the Prime Minister, the Minister for Social **Security** and me.

* The honourable member for Griffith raised the subject of the complaint by the Minister for Social **Security** about assistance being given to the Lord Mayor's flood appeal in Brisbane and not elsewhere.

* I would like very briefly to say that Queensland owes a very great debt to certain Ministers of the Crown - to the Minister for Social **Security**, who was acting as the Treasurer in the early stages, to the Prime Minister, to the Minister for Science, to the Minister for Defence and to the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory as well as other Ministers.

* I pay tribute also to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Department of the Treasury, the Post Office, which restored telephones to people free of cost, and the Department of Social **Security**.

* I again pay tribute to the honourable member for Oxley who, as Minister for Social **Security**, directed that special benefits be paid so that people rendered unemployed by the flood would have to wait a qualifying period of not a fortnight, but only one week before receiving the first payment of assistance from the Australian Government.

* In order to take appropriate account of requirements for **security** of tenure and, in addition, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, the recent agreement with the Northern Land Council in respect of Ranger, and the Memorandum of Understanding, the resulting provisions in this Bill are somewhat involved.

* When we have that direct assessment I think we will all be in a better position to make a judgment on whether a parliamentary delegation, which can pose some **security** and other problems in Kampuchea itself, is the best way of getting additional information to the Australian Government and people about the nature of the assistance which is most required in Kampuchea.

* Matters of foreign policy will often be vital to our national **security**.

* Since the establishment of a homeless persons' section within the Federal Depanment of Social **Security** there has been some activity in the area for men, but women have received limited assistance.

* I plead with the Government to take action in the next quarter, not in the area of social **security** but in the area of government generally, to think of the pensioners, to be a party of conscience and social concern and to give some social concern to the people who are desperately affected by inflation, namely, the thrifty pensioners and the people of substance who have made this country what it is.

* -We have just heard the most extraordinary speech that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has ever made in this place.

* As Opposition spokesman on social **security** I have to handle 6 Bills this week which were introduced only last week by the Government.

* ls it a fact that in a despatch of press releases received by, Members on or about 30th January 1973 there were several pages of what appeared to be a transcript of an interview with either the Minister for Social **Security** or the Minister for Health which was without any heading or indication of who the questioner or answerer was.

* About 800,000 social **security** recipients, people receiving unemployment and sickness benefits, single parents and many age pensioners will now have to pay doctors who can no longer bulk-bill.

* If he is as well informed as some of the front bench members in this House those who have television receivers should not be lulled into a false sense of **security**.

* If this Government, as I believe it will, governs for all Australians, despite the backbreaking efforts it will have to make in fighting on three or four fronts to provide real social progress and change within the capacity of the economy and within a framework of national **security**, it will earn the gratitude of all Australians.

* 1 think it is appropriate that we should -seek membership of the United Nations **Security** Council for 1973 and 1974.

* The use of the, veto at a recent **Security** Council meeting in relation to Middle East violence and terrorism has also been a big disappointment and has unhappily demonstrated once again the patent defects of the United Nations as a world peace-keeping organisation.

* We need realistic assistance for unmarried mothers - not merely the assistance of social **security** payments but advice about their children, advice about employment, advice about child care centres, advice about the education of their children.

* It was worried about its **security** in office, I suppose.

* Our ability to do all the things we wish to do - to maintain our **security**, to improve our housing, health and education, to eliminate poverty, to improve the quality of life - ultimately depends on a steadily increasing national income.

* I pay full tribute to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* It is true that we have not achieved everything we have set out to achieve, but I am indebted to the Minister for Social **Security** for pointing out that the recently announced increase in pensions will bring the Government half way towards its first term of office promise that it would bring pensions up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* The Minister pointed out also that that was much higher than was anticipated for the March quarter of 1974. 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 20 September 1979: 
I have not been in this House a long time but during the election campaign, and ad nauseam since December, we have heard the Government tell us how it espouses open government.

* It seems to mean an AttorneyGeneral in the Australian Government in the dead of night, with Commonwealth Police officers, raiding the premises of a' **security** organisation and holding its officers and staff and preventing them from telephoning or advising anyone of what was happening.

* Minister for Social **Security**.

* Now we have this farce, this absolute farce- 
Australia has not concluded any comprehensive reciprocal agreements on social **security** since 22 February 1 977.

* Before this debate is concluded, will the Minister for Social **Security** at least indicate for the first time what other legislative measures will be introduced which will be complementary to these 2 Bills concerning health which are being debated today, so that the Australian people and this Parliament may know for the first time what other legislation is proposed.

* Married couples who do not obtain home ownership until after they reach the age of 36, and single people, young and old alike, will be assisted under the new scheme to attain the **security** that owning one's home can provide.

* Re-equipment programs have been shovelled aside to the detriment of national **security**.

* -Can the Minister for Social **Security** say whether there are any circumstances in which Australians could be denied the great benefits of Medibank?

* 2243 and the matter raised in this question is within the compass of the Inquiry by  Mr Justice  Hope set in train by the present Government as the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* 2243 and the matter raised in this question is within the compass of the Inquiry by  Mr Justice  Hope set in train by the present Government as the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* Did the Prime Minister tell me on  26  April  1977  (Hansard,  page  1263)  that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Social **Security** were examining the question of the survey in the context of a much wider survey of refugees in Australia.

* One paragraph is headed 'Employment Levels and Job **Security**'.

* Paragraph (a) reads: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
China as a nation has never yet moved outside of its traditional boundaries in an aggressive manner.

* Therefore I suggest to the Minister who is responsible for the operations of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation that he take these people out into the world and let them examine other countries rather than let them interfere with my telephone and interrupt my telephone conversations with little clicks and knocks at all times of the night as they tape record telephone conversations.

* Because of the vital importance of the **security** of the nation and the immense cost of effective defence, it is of the first importance that the national aims and objectives should be clearly and simply stated.

* Yet this alliance, however strong it may be, must not lull us into a false sense of **security**.

* As previously indicated the Government proposes to vest in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal jurisdiction to review decisions of the Director-General of Social **Security** that do not accord with a Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal's recommendation.

* The Council is currently examining the social **security** appeals system and any recommendations it makes will be considered by the Government in due course.

* Section 69 would be applicable in social **security** cases and also in other classes of cases in which the Tribunal has jurisdiction.

* It arises from the evidence given by the defendant in the espionage trial in Los Angeles yesterday to the effect that part of his daily duties in 1975 as a **security** clerk with an aerospace firm was to continue CIA deception against Australia and that he documented the alleged CIA activities in Australia in a letter which, he said, was later passed to the Russians.

* In view of the fact that the defendant was employed by a company which contracts for joint AustralianUnited States defence installations will the Prime Minister draw this matter to the attention of  Mr Justice  Hope who has been inquiring into the intelligence and **security** services for him to make an investigation and report?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 October 1977: 
-The introduction of the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 demonstrates in the clearest possible way that the Government has failed to take seriously the criticisms of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry of the use of the Atomic Energy Act as a vehicle for the commercial development of uranium.

* It has failed to remove the repressive intimidatory **security** measures of the Atomic Energy Act which will now be applicable also to commercial uranium mining.

* Over half the Act is devoted to detailing **security** provisions and regulatory provisions relevant only to military operations.

* The first reason apparently, is that the **security** provisions of the Act offer the Government a means of intimidating and suppressing public opposition to uranium mining.

* The effect was that because the Atomic Energy Commission became the agent of the Government in the Ranger venture, the full **security** provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, including powers under the approved Defence Projects Protection Act, came to apply to any exploitation of Ranger uranium.

* Firstly, as briefly described above, the **security** provisions of the Act are inappropriate to a project with purely peaceful interests.

* The most objectionable aspect of the use of the Atomic Energy Act as a basis for the Government's uranium mining proposals is the frightening powers the Act gives the Government by virtue of its **security** provisions.

* The Government has failed, in the Atomic Energy Act Amendment Bill, to propose any amendments to the Act which could even at the most generous estimate eliminate the worst excesses of the **security** provisions of the Act.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I turn to my second point of criticism, the internal division of the new force.

* the Government was cognisant of the special requirements of the Commonwealth in the fields of protective **security** and the need to retain a relationship of this form of law enforcement with the other general policing functions within the Commonwealth area.

* This could be achieved by constant checking by the Department of Social **Security** and if necessary more frequent increases being granted to meet the rise in costs or- I suppose this would be the best idea of all- for the Government to introduce policies that would control inflation and not increase it.

* and (2) Many countries have contributory social **security** systems which provide superannuation type pensions in retirement.

* The most recent available document which surveys the types of social **security** schemes operating overseas is the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare's publication 'Social **Security** Programmes Throughout the World 1967', which gives the principal features of schemes inthe following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Ceylon, Chad, Chile, China (Nationalist), China (Communist), Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany (Federal Republic), Germany (East), Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Korea (South), Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luxembourg, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Arab Republic, United Kingdom, United States of America, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam (South), Vietnam (North), Yugoslavia, Zambia.

* Department of Social **Security** (via its social workers) 
The numbers of youth looking for a bed contacted by BYS each week exceeds 30.

* Major referring  bodies (to BYS) are the Juvenile Aid Bureau (associated with Queensland Police Department), social workers of the Department of Social **Security**, and Children's Services.

* This point is well covered in the Department of Social **Security** survey of homeless persons assistance centres entitled 'A Place of Dignity' which was printed in June this year.

* The Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  who represents the Minister for Social **Security**,  (Senator Guilfoyle)  gave notice in the second reading speech of the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill that the program which will implement the basics of the Homeless Persons Assistance Act is now sufficiently well established to warrant discussion with State governments on their views about the sharing of responsibilities in this area.

* On 31 July the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  announced that he would be allocating $250,000 for the purpose of advertising not the Australian health insurance program but the proposed Australian health insurance program - a program which has not as yet been submitted to the scrutiny of this House or this Parliament, a program which has not yet been translated into legislative form and which may not ever be translated into legislative form.

* -Has the Minister for Social **Security** noted a newspaper comment attributed to a  Mr Gross,  a full time commissioner of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission, criticising the Government's universal health insurance program?

* The Tenancy Committee comprises the Project Manager, an officer of the Department of Social **Security** and an officer of the Department of Housing and Construction with experience in tenancy matters.

* The payout for unemployment benefits in the last financial year, according to the annual report from the Department of Social **Security**- this can be checked by the honourable member who is interjecting - was $25 1,740,000-odd.

* The  DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Drury)-I  think that the matter of unemployment comes within the Department of Social **Security** and that the question of social **security** benefits is a matter for the Department of Social **Security**.

* I for one object to the fact that some of the tax I pay will go to keep in idleness some person who boasts that he has no intention of seeking employment but is content to draw unemployment benefits from the Department of Social **Security**.

* It would stop the duplication of unemployment benefits to the one person, and I am positive that co-operation between local governments, the Commonwealth Employment Service, and the Department of Social **Security** would make such a scheme workable.

* Will the Minister for Social **Security** inform the House how pensioner medical services will be affected by the introduction of Medibank?

* In the light of the trenchant criticism of Australia's secret agencies contained in the published part of the Hope report, what has the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation done in the last 12 months to warrant the considerable increase in its budgetary allocation.

* It is not the practice of this Government to give information which may have the effect of endangering **security**.

* Has the Minister for Social **Security** distributed a paper which differs from the Treasurer's analysis of the economic crisis and proposes different solutions?

* Because these high principles are involved in Australia's national interests and in Australia's national **security**, we must support the Prime Minister's important moves to recognise and to welcome mainland China to the United Nations.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
What sum was paid by the Department of Social **Security**, or by Departments, formerly encompassing the functions now performed by the Department of Social **Security**, to each airline for air travel within Australia during 1 976-77.

* Why does the Government not face up to the fact that it issued a policy directive to the Department of Social **Security** stating that it should not pay any school leavers the unemployment benefit until 22 February 1977?

* It was under the Menzies Government that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  and the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Jeff Bate)  raided Garden Island which was then under strict **security**.

* I can say to you,  Mr Speaker,  in all sincerity that the people of Swan want the opportunities of employment and they want the opportunities to make their own **security**, but they do not want governments to make their **security** for them.

* The time has come to bring the whole social **security** system into parity and equity.

* Many pensioners have continued to advise the Department of Social **Security** of their income for 'fringe' benefit purposes.

* As the Act stands at present the Department of Social **Security** has been advised that it is possible for two people to be paid a full family allowance for the same child at the same time.

* Will the Minister discuss the matter with his colleagues, the Minister for Police and Customs, the Minister for Social **Security** and the Treasurer, to see what steps can be taken to assist to overcome problems created by present Government policy.

* The honourable member has missed again, as he missed the boat so frequently when Minister for Social **Security** and when Treasurer in the previous Government.

* It says: 
My question is directed to the Prime Minister who has overall responsibility for the **security** of Australia.

* In addition to its own resources, the CES in each urea liaises with such bodies as the Department of Social **Security**'s Interpreter Service for migrants, bank migrant services, the Good Neighbour Council and civic minded members of ethnic communities.

* Further, is there any intention of transferring his responsibility for women's refuges to the Department of Social **Security**?

* The most pressing need in the next triennium is to provide adequate opportunities to individuals to further their educational development, including their capacity to become skilled, knowledgeable, adaptable members of the labour force, and through this, to enhance **security** and job satisfaction.

* One then gets to the figure of $7,000m, being the total appropriation for social **security** this financial year.

* I make the point that the fringe benefits to which I refer are those received from the Department of Social **Security**, from State departments of transport, from Telecom Australia and so on.

* The members of the Commonwealth Public Service were cleared of any suspicion of conspiracy by the findings of the relevant heads that there had been a wrong report by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representative at the meeting between him and representatives of other departments on 2nd March.

* (9A) Where it is proposed to engage for employment under this section a person who is not a British subject, or a person who is a British subject but is also a national of another country, the Minister may, after a report from the Board and if it appeals to him that the employment of that person would not be prejudicial to the national **security**, the preservation of official secrecy or any other interest of  the Commonwealth, determine that the last preceding sub-section is not to apply in relation  to  the engagement of that person.

* As the Minister for Social **Security** persistently has denied that the Australian Labor Party health scheme, particularly the medical benefits aspect of it, has any connection with the Canadian scheme I ask him: Are senior members of his Department now in Canada or on their way there?

* The legislation also says to the rest of the Murray district: The position is a little easier, it gives you a little more **security** but you may remain in your straitjacket - if we take it literally - forever.

* foreign students who because of their political activities in Australia fear for their personal **security** upon returning to their home country be granted permanent residence in Australia.

* This delay could have meant that Australians who travelled by ship and those who travelled in Australian waters were deprived of the additional **security** provided in the international regulations.

* Pathetically, the Health Insurance Bill 1973 has been brought on with a time scale for debate which will, after the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has given his second reading speech, mean presumably that there will be one, two or five minutes for the Opposition to respond to it, and then it will be guillotined.

* When the Minister for Social **Security** brought this Bill in he and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said: 'If the Opposition rejects this Bill we will regard it as a major Bill and we will take the Opposition to a double dissolution.'

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
This clause includes reference to the repayment of a loan.

* The new definitive clause is needed therefore to make it clear that any reference in the Bill with respect to loans or grants for the building or purchase of dwellings or for the purchase of land, includes loans or grants to take over or discharge charges, mortgages or encumbrances entered into as **security** for loans raised for the building or purchase of dwellings or the purchase of land.

* I refer to the somewhat extreme measures which seem to be contemplated in this Parliament for our so-called **security**.

* But this sympathy certainly was not shared by a number of his colleagues, notably the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who was busily interjecting whilst his colleague was answering the question.

* It is no good the Minister for Social **Security** being so half smart about the Australian wool industry in its hour of need as he was this morning at question time because he is going to require thousands of millions of dollars to carry out the social welfare ambitions of the Government.

* It is equally certain that as British influence is withdrawn the peoples of these islands are going to look elsewhere both for economic and strategic **security**.

* Surely it is vital to our own future **security** that these people should turn towards Australia and to New Zealand for help and protection, rather than to any other nation.

* At this moment history is being written in a region of the world which is vital to our **security**.

* This legislation certainly gives a new sense of **security** while allowing people to create and perform with complete freedom.

* Which are the **security** organisations in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea about whose operations the Attorney-General consulted with him before answering the question by the honourable member for Deakin and me on 17th March (Hansard, pages 452 and 458).

* Why has the Public Officers (Employment **Security**) Ordinance, ordained by the House of Assembly for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in October 1967 and assented to by the Governor-General in January 1968, not yet come into operation.

* How many migrants of each nationality have been refused naturalisation on **security** grounds  based upon (a) extreme left wing political views or associations and (b) extreme right wing political view or associations.

* In other cases the provisions of Wireless Telegraphy Regulation 36(3) protects **security**.

* Is the Minister for Social **Security** aware of the situation which has developed at the Templestowe private hospital in my electorate where notice of termination of employment has been given to the nursing and other staff?

* Has his attention been drawn to reports of the views of Milton Friedman, an American economist, being circulated to members, recommending a negative income tax, a shut down of social **security** and the closure of tax loopholes; if so, what is his attitude to these proposals.

* -Did the Prime Minister announce before the last election that he would legislate to allow for the payment of certain social **security** benefits to be credited direct to a beneficiary's credit union savings account?

* It would be a very proper thing for this Parliament now to see that such basic financial institutions as building societies are equated much more in their operations to banks - that is, we should guarantee their **security** and in return they should pursue the public interest in their lending policies.

* The Department of Social **Security** has referred a request for assistance from the Kojonup Apex Club for $2,000 to improve and upgrade the local park.

* 1779 (Hansard, 5 December 1974, page 4763), has his attention been drawn to item 18- Statistics of Public Service applicants rejected on **security** grounds.

For the information of honourable members I present a statement by the Minister for Social **Security** relating to the children's services program which will provide care for school age children during the coming Christmas school vacation.

* -Has the Prime Minister yet completed his consideration of the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** conducted by  Mr Justice  Hope?

* The  fact is that in 1972, when I was the Prime Minister, I received a report from a special technical committee of the Defence Committee which advised that the Committee as a whole was unable to determine conclusively the **security** considerations attached to nuclear powered and nuclear armed ships going into Cockburn Sound.

* He said that we can do nothing about the activities of foreign **security** organisations in Australia.

* He said that in 1945, 1946 and 1947 the then Prime Minister, Attorney-General and Minister for Foreign Affairs said that **security** was a matter of **security**.

* I would suggest that at that time the range of activities of **security** organisations and their capacity was considerably less than it is now.

* Since that time at least one international **security** organisation has participated in the overthrow of governments in Chile, Cambodia and Thailand.

* The **security** organisations of the Left, as honourable members opposite would call them- of the communist bloc-have participated in the overthrow of governments more numerous than will be elaborated upon in this debate.

* The facts are that **security** organisations now are not just collectors of information; they are political exponents that will seek wherever necessary to ensure the existence of a government that will pander to their needs and promote policies within their requirements.

* Parliamentary supervision of **security** organisations is possible.

* It is in fact part of the responsibilities of the Congress of the United States to oversee that country's **security** organisations and the excesses of one of them have been curbed because of an investigation carried out by the Congress of the United States.

* The basis of the argument that parliamentary supervision is not possible is a basis of an argument that Parliament itself cannot be trusted with the **security** of the country.

* There are at least indications that information important to the Government and the **security** of this country was withheld from Ministers because **security** organisations chose to act as censors of the information.

* I am sure that the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  for instance, would like to be able to be informed reliably- not by rumour or innuendo- on the activities of **security** agents from Yugoslavia and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other **security** agents in Australia.

* If a **security** organisation is going to seek to overthrow the government of Australia or place it in a position in which it has to pursue policies designated by another country the Parliament is entitled to know.

* The people of Australia do not elect the **security** services, they do not control them and they know nothing whatsoever about their activities.

* The Parliament is entitled to some scrutiny, especially over those areas of **security** activities that impinge upon the civil liberties of individuals and the private activities of persons in their business and work affairs.

* We are not talking about disclosing information that would endanger the **security** of the nation.

* The control of the infrastructure in this country can be changed by a **security** service that has access, and **security** services do have access, to monitoring devices and other forms of media control that influence people.

* Allegations are currently being made that foreign **security** funds were used to undermine one political party and fund another in Australia.

* That certainly happened in Chile and Australian **security** organisations were certainly involved in that exercise.

* It certainly happened in Cambodia, and there is at least a suspicion that Australian **security** operatives were involved in the overthrow of Sihanouk, which ultimately led to the overthrow of any elected government in that country.

* The United States Congress, through subcommittees of its various committees, is able to establish surveillance over United States **security** activities.

* What proportion of total social **security** payments is spent on (a) sickness benefits, (b) old age pensions, (c) invalid pensions, (d ) unemployment benefits, (e ) family allowances, and (f) other.

* The particular aspects of the question do not come directly within my ministerial responsibility but, I would expect, within the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**.

* These permit entry to the area for activities such as prospecting, subject to compliance by the party concerned with specified safety and **security** requirements.

* impose a threat to Australia's **security** is laughable.

* At the same time [ commend that great band of Labor men who have come to the Parliament from rural areas - the honourable member for Dawson, the honourable member for Riverina, the honourable member for Darling  (Mr FitzPatrick)  and members from other States - who will give real leadership to the country people and who will bring stability back to rural industry and withstand the criticisms falsely levelled against them by those in the Parliament who are sent here to represent, country interests but who do nothing but criticise the efforts from this side of the Parliament to provide that **security** and stability.

* If anyone has tried to betray anything at Pine Gap, it is the people who have tried to breach **security** and to betray to our enemies or to our possible enemies the secrets of the Pine Gap installation which are vital for national defence.

* -I direct my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The situation therefore would be better handled if in the short term the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  were made responsible for the Commission.

* Are itinerant relatives of the employees discouraged from camping on the property by being offered no help with social **security** applications and by having no rights to cash cheques or buy from the company store, and are retrenched employees encouraged to leave the property.

* I do not think many Australians realise the importance of the **security** of the Indian Ocean to us.

* The statistics which are available so far for 1970-71 already show an increase of 22 million tons in 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I wish to draw attention to the particular plight of unemployed in my electorate of Swan.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice:

* As a consequence of the compassion and concern of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Department, about 100 special benefits were paid to school leavers.

* In respect of the claim that Aboriginals are being discriminated against, I categorically refute the allegation that the Department of Social **Security** or, for that matter, any other Department has discriminated against Aboriginal people.

* This is true but it is not true to say that this is due to any lack of money or **security**.

* One of the most scurrilous episodes in this process of beating up stories on dole cheats was the treatment by the Press of a Department of Social **Security** survey released in September 1975, which showed that, in one area, of 14 462 unemployment benefit recipients who were investigated 30 per cent were found to be ineligible for benefits.

* However, as the then Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Wheeldon,  said in his Press statement when releasing this survey, the number of people found to be not entitled to the benefit did not mean that people were cheating.

* But, further to that, the records show that many of those who have their benefits removed following investigation by the Department of Social **Security** field officers win them back on appeal.

* The Minister's statement refers to 112 000 beneficiaries being investigated by the Department of Social **Security** field officers between May 1975 and January 1976.

* In November and December 1970 the State Department of Health in Queensland and the Department of Social **Security**, respectively asked the proprietor of the home what were her intentions as to the future operation of the home, especially in relation to the report by the Fire Brigade Board.

* In February 1971 a letter was received by the Department of Social **Security** from the proprietor stating that it was rather difficult for her to say exactly what her intentions would be.

* The proposal which has been put to the Queensland Government is a clear indication of the sincerity of our intent and of our concern about the **security** of people in private profit making nursing homes designated by the Brisbane Metropolitan Fire Brigade report as being fire hazards.

* We have recently had admissions by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that this is to be the case.

* arms to the Vietcong by Australian servicemen in Vietnam been brought to the notice of the Australian Ambassador by the United States **Security** Services.

* I ask the Attorney-General: How many persons have been prosecuted for subversive activities considered to be detrimental to the **security** and national interest since the Liberal-Country Party Government assumed office in 1949?

* What changes have been made in the direction and co-ordination of **security** and intelligence services in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea since he was last asked about them (Hansard, 14th April 1970, page 1111).

* I direct my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* by some of our compatriots as well as by some foreigners, as fairly unambitious folk who are preoccupied with comfort, money and property, with concern mainly for economic stability and **security**.

* First we want land tenure and land **security** of all the land included in the present Yarrabah Reserve, including Mission Bay.

* It has asked for **security** of land tenure in that beautiful area- it is a beautiful area- and self-management.

* They believe that they have **security** over their land.

* I am confident that good sense and charity will prevail and that we will get **security** of land tenure and self-management not only for Yarrabah but also for all the communities in Queensland that want it.

* These are the issues as we have placed them before the House: First of all there is the people's entitlement to know of any commitment which involves the national **security** and the forces of Australia.

* Pursuant to section 148 of the Social Services Act 1947-1973, I present the first annual report of the Director-General of Social **Security** for the year ended 30 June 1973.

* Maintaining policies which have caused incredibly high inflation which has reduced people'ssavings by almost one-third since the present Labor Government has been in office and which threatens people's -**security** and the very basis of our institutions;

* The allegation was that a phone tap had been put on the private phone of  Mr Justice  Staples by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* of July 1978 which claims that Medibank computer records can be used by the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation?

* The Government made it clear to me that it would not have legislation committees sitting while the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill was being debated in the House because of the importance of that Bill and because it was an issue that divided the two sides of the House.

* the advisability of hiring a Hong Kong based, wholly-foreign-owned company to carry out surveillance functions involving protection and **security** of remote areas of Australian sovereign territory and coastline; 
The Opposition welcomes this review.

* Despite its obvious party political bias it is a step towards a more intelligent and informed debate not only in this House, but also among the Australian people on a matter that is vital to us all - the defence and **security** of the country in which we live.

* What is fundamental is the **security** of Australian soil and unless we can ensure and are seen to ensure our capability of doing this our credibility will always be questioned.

* Devoid of any pretensions to have provided for the **security** of Australia, the Government has sought to divert attention from its own incompetence by creating a side issue of the maintenance of bases in Malaysia and Singapore.

* The Group is conceived as a small, informal and unofficial body of highly qualified people convened to assess the current and prospective patterns of nuclear development in the light of pressures imposed not only by energy demand but also by environmental and **security** factors.

* The point I am making is that unless it is a matter of national **security** we in the Commonwealth Parliament have no right to sit in judgment on whether a person has committed a felony in the States which is so bad as would allow the State Government to prosecute safely.

* In view of the AttorneyGeneral's statement in the Senate yesterday that he discussed with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet the whole matter of the course he took in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation affair and why he took that course, and that he outlined to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet his reasons for taking that course, will the Prime Minister now assure the House that he did not deliberately mislead the Parliament and the Press yesterday?

* Although hitherto power has been in the form of promises to apply or withhold military capabilities - this still would be paramount in vital **security** issues - this will have little utility compared with other forms of power, even a negative effect, in bargaining over non-**security** issues.

* In consequence of the Government's decision to implement in substance the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and to give the Australian Federal Police all necessary powers for narcotics inquiries, certain consequential amendments need to be made to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.

* and (2) Within the past five years there have been discussions relating to the possibility of reciprocity in social **security** with representatives  of the countries listed below.

* I have constantly made it clear that the Government has no intention whatsoever of reacting to the many rumours which are constantly brought out in an attempt to try and undermine the **security** of the American bases in Australia.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 May 1978: 
How many officers of the Department of Social **Security** were employed as inquiry officers to examine the accuracy of information provided by social **security** applicants or recipients as at 1 May 1978.

* I move now to social **security** matters.

* In considering this Budget, whilst there may be certain sections in it and certain factors which may be criticised, to my mind what  must be  looked at is an overall picture of ultimate achievement for the economic **security** of the country.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  spoke earlier.

* I am certain that we could get the co-operation of the State governments, in partnership with the Federal Government, to do something that we think ought to be done for a sensible, responsible attempt to have a circuit breaker or breathing space, to use the term of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice:

* -Does the Prime Minister deny that the only reasonable construction that could be put on the words 'unprecedented', 'extraordinary ' and 'gravely damaging to ASIO and to the national **security** interest' is that a complaint was being made?

* Impact statements will be released to the public except on those occasions where it is not in the public interest to do so, for example where land speculation might be encouraged or where national **security** might be endangered.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** a question, and I will give him the opportunity either to mislead the House or not mislead the House as he misled a television audience on Sunday night- 
If not, what are the other reasons, apart from questions of national **security**, which lead him to the belief that general release of information concerning interdepartmental committees, other than those publicly known to be functioning or to have functioned, is unwarranted.

* If so, did the Australian Council of Churches express alarm at the reported raid during which **security** police allegedly sealed the building and after an 8 hour search left with boxes of files.

* Having regard to the importance- acknowledged I believe, by both sides of the House- of the Joint Defence Space Research Facility to the interests of Australia and the United States; to the importance of the co-operation of our two countries under the ANZUS Treaty; and having regard to the requirements for **security** of tenure at Pine Gap to protect substantial investments in buildings, machinery, skilled manpower and effort, and the requirement to support long term planning in these respects, we have decided to accede to the United States Government's request.

* I have referred to the importance of the facility; the House will know that for **security** reasons I cannot elucidate on this.

* I present the following paper: 
Pursuant to section 9 of the Social Services Act 1947 I present the annual report of the Department of Social **Security** for the year ended 30 June 1977.

* For the information of honourable members I present a report entitled 'Families and Social Services in Australia', together with the text of a statement by the Minister for Social **Security** relating to the report.

* 3 ) What proportion of those persons on waiting lists were (a) unemployed and (b) in receipt of social **security** benefits other than unemployment benefits.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that many Cabinet submissions are dreary, routine and innocuous documents that have no bearing on defence or national **security** and contain nothing that is detrimental to public interest.

* I want to explain, in complete contrast to the negatory statements made by the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating),  about the contribution that this Government has made towards the development and **security** of primary industries in this country - industries which have contributed, which still contribute and which will contribute indefinitely to the betterment of life of every member of this nation; industries which in spite of the adverse circumstances of last year still generate 50 per cent of Australia's export earnings.

* What assessment has been made of this statement and, in particular, its implications for Australian **security**?

* If this sort of settlement were to be accepted by the West, in some sort of uncritical way, as the finality of what can be achieved, I am afraid there would be rather grave disturbances to the balance and the general **security** of the nations of 
Whatever the relationship between the Attorney-General and the organization (and its Director-General) is or should be, it has always been accepted that matters of **security** policy are, so far as the Government is concerned, the responsibility of the Prime Minister.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I preface my question to the Treasurer by referring to the issue at par, as from 1 November 1978, of Series 13 Australian Savings Bonds and ask: Is it a fact that these bonds carry an interest rate of 8.73 per cent if not redeemed prior to 1 June 1979?

* If so, does this mean that Australian Savings Bonds Series 13 are now an extremely attractive form of short term gilt-edged **security**?

* It is incredible that honourable members opposite can say that it does not matter whether a file is kept by the **security** agents of this country.

* I suspect that many honourable members on the Opposition side of the Parliament have told of their experiences with the various **security** forces of this country since we began participating in the Labor movement.

* But for honourable mem.benumber rs opposite to say that the fact that a **security** document may be kept on each one of us is not important because we do not have anything to hide seems to show a complete lack of understanding of what **security** forces are all about.

* Those opposite who say this sort of thing are completely ignorant of the role of the Central Intelligence Agency in such events as Watergate, its role in Vietnam, its role in Cambodia, the role of **security**, the way the CIA canvasses and lobbies politicians, and the way that the CIA keeps files on people.

* There must be some criteria for the **security** forces to keep a file on anybody.

* It said that it was working in cahoots with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* That is the sort of thing that these **security** forces do.

* The **security** organisation makes up its own mind.

* The monarchy is also important because Australians want stability in institutions, so that they can plan ahead with a real degree of **security** .

* It seemed to be a carefully prepared speech and one which could bc laid at the door of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The Department of Social **Security** with its empire building Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  - I have referred to him in that way before - is gradually taking over the other 2 departments.

* -The amendment proposed by the Opposition is designed to extend the bipartisan approach by which the Opposition believes the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill ought to be approached.

* This Bill enables our **security** organisation to have powers that on any view of it greatly infringe upon and impede the rights and the liberties of the Australian citizen.

* It is unfortunately true that in the past the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and its powers have been used for party political partisan purposes.

* In the fourth report, volume 1, page 2 1 9 at paragraph 46 1 ,  His  Honour stated: 
If there is to be a bipartisan approach it is necessary that the opposition pany or parties should be informed about **security** matters, and the appropriate way to do this is by consultation between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and by reports by the Director-General of **Security** to the Leader of the Opposition.

* It would not matter if I were a member of a Labor government and this Bill were our legislation, I would say that the **security** and the protection of the rights and liberties of the Australian people would be enhanced and safeguarded by the simple fact that the Leader of the Opposition whoever he may be- whether it is the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  or the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  who is sitting at the table, or anyone of a host of prominent members of the Liberal Party- would be kept fully informed as of right within the terminology of the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition.

* We reluctantly believe that many of these powers are necessary for a **security** organisation, but in giving those powers to a **security** organisation we need to have a system of checks and balances to ensure that the prerogatives of this Parliament and through those prerogatives the rights of the Australian people, are maintained.

* Since 1975 when the concept of identifying a measure of subsidy was introduced, interest has been payable on the corpus of initial capital vested in the Corporation at the weighted average of long-term **security** rates over the previous 25 years.

* Of course expenditure on defence matters is important to the **security** of Queensland and the rest of Australia.

* In fact, as the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has pointed out, the Opposition is co-operating with the Government to ensure that the legislation is passed through this 
I thank the House.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has placed himself in a somewhat equivocal position in relation to them.

* But it is far more soul destroying to Aborigines to be paid to sit down and not work than it is to pay social **security** benefits to white people.

* As indicated previously, the balance remains at call as **security** for the IBRD's own borrowing operations on world capital markets.

* For the information of honourable members I present a report prepared by the Department of Social **Security** entitled 'Second Annual Report of the Director-General 1973-74'.

* Yes, by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* "Indications of community well-being: a report to the Department of Social **Security**, (4 copies).

* The people of the developing world cannot achieve a reduction in the rate of their births in relation to the rate of their deaths until they have some expectation that they can have employment, **security** and sufficient food.

* It could have sought a voice in the **Security** Council.

* Notice has been received from the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** of his intention at the next day of sitting to present a Bill relating to social services amendment.

* Why are Commonwealth car drivers subject to **security** checks and regular health checks when these checks are not required for hire car drivers anad taxi drivers.

* Does current planning for a high **security** offshore quarantine station still envisage that all animals passing through the station at any one time should all be drawn from the same region of the world; if so, why.

* But that was rejected as being in the province of the Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Margaret  Guilfoyle.

* Did the Income **Security** Review report on the National Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme covering injuries pursuant to its terms of reference which I announced on 8 September 1975. 
the disclosure of information that would, in the opinion of the Minister, be contrary to the public interest by reason that it would prejudice the **security**, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth or relations between the Commonwealth and any State; or 
The actual costs associated with aviation **security** measures instituted by individual airlines are not available to my Department nor are the detailed costs of the measures of the Australian Government in this area.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Miscellaneous small facilities including a small boat shed and ramp, flammable store, **security** control post, and covered parking for service vehicles; 
I note in one of the Appropriation Bills that a sum of money has been made available for natural disaster relief.

* At one time there was in this Parliament enthusiasm for **security** of living.

* But, from the point of view of the Opposition, it is quite critical that we take this action seeking the suspension of the Standing Orders so that we can demonstrate the concern that we feel on matters of tremendous moment to the Parliament including the inconsistencies that the Governmnent has demonstrated in its attitude within the United Nations, the inconsistencies in and the unrealistic way by which the Government has approached foreign issues, its relationships with the United States of America, with the Middle East and with other countries in the world, which affect quite vitally the **security** of this country, the fundamental attitudes of overseas countries to Australia and our acceptability in trading terms with other countries.

* Is it still the practice for the Auditor-General to pass Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation accounts on documents certified by him; if so, what kind of audit does he carry out before signing that certificate.

* On 31st March 1970, the Commonwealth borrowed an amount of $250,230,000 for that purpose on the **security** of Treasury Notes issued to the Reserve Bank, and on 31 March 1971 an amount of $190,000,000 was similarly borrowed.

* Miscellaneous small facilities including a small boat shed and ramp, flammable store, **security** control post, and covered parking for service vehicles; 
The significance of a comprehensive test ban in relation to these countries is that they have not become parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

* The so-called negative nuclear **security** assurances, or undertakings by the nuclear weapon states not to use weapons against non-nuclear weapon states which have renounced the acquisition of nuclear weapons, are also important.

* All these activities have relevance to Australian **security** and foreign policy.

* The Government fails in that regard to defend Australia's national **security** interests.

* I said then- if it has been corrected since, well and good- that our Government should be pressing the United States to take the same and positive step of ratification, in defence of our Australian national **security** interests.

* If the United States does not ratify SALT II there will be grave consequences for our **security** and for global stability.

* So far as regional policies are concerned, we consider the Government's policy of taking sides in relation to the wars in Indo-China to be destructive to regional **security**.

* The continued recognition of the Pol Pot regime - 
In the totality, therefore, these major projects and some  20  others of lesser significance indicate no reduction in the present civic action programme undertaken by the Army, which is fully aware of the importance of civic action and civic aid to the **security** and the economy of the province.

* This combined claim form will be available at post offices and offices of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I think that the farmer believes that the **security** of this kind of delivery is not good enough for important documents which are left in the letter boxes.

* .The Government will, from time to time, inform the Parliament and make public all the information about these activities as would be consistent with national **security**.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The public servant has **security** of tenure.

* I preface my question by saying that I accept the value of the agencies within the United Nations, but in my opinion the latest action of the United Nations **Security** Council in its condemnation of aggression on behalf of South Africa and the request that compensation be paid proves that this organisation is a complete farce.

* In my opinion it is no longer of any value - 
1 ) Commonwealth funds have been provided to Good Neighbour Councils through my Depanment since 1950, except for a brief period when the Depanment of Social **Security** was the funding Department.

* As **security** is required he offers a mortgage over his plant and equipment and a bill of sale over his farm.

* Social **Security** 
The Government has decided to introduce a 3 year program costing $225m to eliminate the current backlog of applications from organisations seeking subsidies for the building of aged persons' accommodation.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will provide further details.

* The Minister for Social **Security** is meeting with the State Ministers in Darwin tomorrow in order to discuss future arrangements for this program.

* We are sorry that in 1973 the Opposition parties are revealed to hold social values which would require that a million Australians barter their dignity for their health and we are particularly sorry to note that the Liberal Party spokesman on social **security** has put those 1 million Australians together in one category and labelled them as 'pensioners, the indolent, migrants, no-hopers and alcoholics'.

* It is indeed a sad comment on the diligence of the Liberal Party spokesman on social **security** that he even gets his own errors wrong.

* It will enhance the **security** of all Australians and will be conducive to a better quality of care.

* What is involved is not a judgment about cost, but a judgment by the community as a whole about its social and economic priorities - whether it wants dignity and **security** for its retired members, or whether it wants to continue a system which cuts by two-thirds the income of most people immediately they retire, and whether it wants to continue a system which inflicts the humiliations and hardships highlighted in this Budget.

* No Government has ever identified so many real or imagined threats to our economic well-being or military **security**.

* By all means let us take sides if the principles are clear, if humanitarian rights are at stake, if our own interests or **security** are involved; but not when the facts are flimsy and disputed and more is to be lost than gained from intervention.

* It is to ignore the significance of the European **Security** Conference, including the Soviet concessions on human rights.

* While the Lebanese Government considers it to be the only effective **security** force in Lebanon, the Maronite militia leaders now consider it to be an army of occupation.

* The Australian Government supports United Nations **Security** Council Resolution 436 of 6 October 1978.

* But, with a large and very concerned Lebanese community in Australia, and in the face of a most serious situation of conflict, it is the right and responsibility of any government concerned with humanitarian issues and those of international peace and **security** to make its views known.

* If the United Nations were to look to the **Security** Council to consider some expanded peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, we have to bear in mind that an international consensus on the possible form of or even the need for such action does not exist at the moment.

* Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that the **Security** Council could go much beyond its resolution of 6 October.

* Rehabilitation of those members of the armed forces who are not disabled by war service will, I understand, be provided by the Department of Social **Security** unless they had war service overseas.

* As the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  has pointed out on more than one occasion, the exMinister decided at some stage many years ago to breach the **security** arrangements at the Garden Island Naval Dockyard.

* Mr Deputy Chairman,  may I suggest that consideration of the proposed expenditure for the Department of Health, the Repatriation Department and the Department of Social **Security** be postponed?

* foreign students who because of their political activities in Australia fear for their personal **security** upon returning to their home country be granted permanent residence in Australia.

* foreign students who because of their political activities in Australia fear for their person **security** upon returning to their home country be granted permanent residence in Australia.

* Will the Minister for Social **Security** clarify the role of Medibank in respect of people who use medical and hospital services away from their home State?

* Recalling the **Security** Treaty which was concluded at San Francisco between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America on the first day of September 1951 .

* The politics of this country have reached a pathetic stage when the Prime Minister has to resort to the use of an internal **security** organisation to try to undermine his political opponents.

* Do the housing programs of the Departments of Social **Security**, Veterans' Affairs or Environment, Housing and Community Development, provide any specific allocations for Aboriginal housing.

* 1 ) Are persons living together in a de facto relationship treated as a married couple for purposes of the social **security** means test, etc.

* Off-shore, high **security** animal quarantine station at West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands; review of fifth report, 1 973.

What (a) official and (b) unofficial contacts have there been between Australian Government Members and officials and the South African Bureau of State **Security** since November 1975.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** a question and so give him an opportunity to correct a misleading answer which he gave to this House when he was replying to a question about nursing home benefits asked by the honourable member for Adelaide.

* My Government rededicates itself to govern for all Australians and to work in partnership with all groups to build an Australia in which its people can have **security**, the knowledge that they can plan ahead with assurance, and that their efforts will be rewarded.

* True, they receive the benefit of **security** and the status of a judge.

* Only when we can reorganise the shipbuilding industry in this country, and apply this sort of economic planning policy to it and to so many other areas of secondary industry will we have **security** of employment.

* These programs have greatly enhanced the standard of living and **security** of previously isolated and poverty stricken rural communities.

* As has been explained by the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden),  this is a time for consolidation of advances pending a full review of the income **security** system in the next 12 months.

* While it will of course continue to be necessary for officers of the Department of Social **Security** to determine the facts in these matters it is proposed to reinforce the instructions already in force that all such inquiries must be conducted with tact and discretion.

* The record of the Australian Labor Government in the field of social **security** since it gained office in December 1972 speaks for itself.

* We have introduced new initiatives in social **security** that were left lying on the table or under the table for 23 years during the administration of governments formed by the Opposition parties.

* As there is talk of election in the air at the moment I want the people in receipt of social **security** pensions to recognise that this Government has done more for them in 3 years than previous governments did in 23 years.

* The departments to which the staff were transferred from 1 December 1973 and the numbers of staff involved in respect of each department are as follows: Department of Foreign Affairs, 410; Department of the Special Minister of State, 15; Department of the Treasury, 12; Department of the Media, 2; Department of Social **Security**, 1; Department of Tourism and Recreation, 1.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
No.

* The distribution of Medibank material, including Health Insurance cards and publicity material has been handled either by the Post Office, the Department of Social **Security**, or by the Health Insurance Commission itself.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Subject to this Act and to the directions of the Minister as to matters of general policy, the Director may, upon application in writing, make an advance to an eligible person on the prescribed **security**, for the purpose of enabling him - 
But there are some general points that I think I should make in fairness to the Army.

* Fourthly,- the **security** of the personal arms - usually automatic weapons - of the soldiers on a commercial bus is usually better than that on other forms of transport.

* Sunday, a number of people marched on the United States Consulate in Melbourne smashing the windows of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation on the way- 
and (2) Yes.

* Payment of repatriation pensions be made through the Social **Security** Department and that the Repatriation Commission be retained to handle the determining of claims, reviews and administration.

* Plans are well advanced for the introduction of a social service **security** appeals system and I expect that tribunals will be operating early  in  1975.

* Not only have we not had the efficient quarantine facility we need as a safeguard from the exotic diseases that can come into this country, particularly foot and mouth disease with all its devastating consequences, but also we have never had a maximum **security** laboratory to enable us to isolate those diseases and effectively deal with them.

* Is the Army or any other Service of the Armed Forces in Papua 'New Guinea being trained in internal **security** techniques.

* That all words after That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place  thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**'.

I ask the Minister for Social **Security** a question concerning a report in the Melbourne 'Sun' of 22 October relating to a reserve health plan if this Parliament rejects the Government's national health insurance legislation.

* -At the outset I want to say how deeply concerned the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  is about social **security** matters.

* As has been stated in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  they require treatment and counselling.

* One wonders what is the eventual aim of the Minister for Social **Security** in this matter.

* 1 ) How many persons have been refused (a) entry into Australia as permanent residents on **security** grounds (b) Australian citizenship on **security** grounds in each of the last 10 years.

* Has the change in any individual case resulted in a breach of or threat to Australian **security**.

* What procedures exist for persons disadvantaged by **security** reports to test the factual basis of such reports.

* to (5) See the Prime Minister's statement to the House of 25 October 1977 on the Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* It is part of a growing recognition that Indo-China matters not a jot to America's **security** or basic interests.

* Though the Opposition has sought to criticise the legislation, as time goes by we will see the full benefit of the action of the Commonwealth in ensuring that the Queensland Parliament passed special legislation for the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities which gives them selfmanagement and **security** of tenure of their land, something they have never had before.

* The meeting held last Thursday between leaders of the two communities, the Queensland Minister for Local Government,  Mr Hinze,  the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs,  Mr Porter,  and the co-ordinating and advisory committee established by that legislation, of which my regional director in Brisbane is a member, will lay the foundation for the success of all the Commonwealth's efforts to bring about self-management for those two communities and to provide a **security** of tenure to the traditional land occupied by them, a **security** which they did not enjoy previously.

* After that election the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  decided that a committee should report to the Parliament on how the scheme would be implemented.

* I want to say to the Minister for Social **Security** as one Queenslander to another that he ought not to be proud of this scheme, particularly as it affects his own State.

* An amount of $56m has been allocated for an animal health laboratory in Geelong; $28m is to be made available to the dairy reconstruction scheme outlined in this legislation; $40m is being spent in the first advance on wheat $28m is being spent on rural reconstruction overall; $45 m is being spent on the National Disaster Fund; $ 11.5m is being spent this year on the isolated children's allowance throughout country districts; $21m is being allocated this year to rural universities- it was only $6m in 1972; $47m is being allocated this year to colleges of advanced education in rural areas- it was only $ 12m in 1972; and $880m or 46 per cent of our expenditure on social **security** payments goes to rural districts.

* To generate confidence among growers that prices will not decline to unremunerative levels, hence aiding production planning, facilitating **security** in financing of grower investments, and encouraging more stable long term production.

* The point is this: We ought to be able to apply the general principles of law right across the board whether in drug cases, **security** cases or tax avoidance cases.

* by leave  -  I would like to thank the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for his very prompt attention to this question.

* One matter is that the cost of **security** arrangements is rising rapidly; I am not sure that the **security** itself is increasing at the same rate.

* There is at least a school of opinion which suggests that the development of our visible **security** arrangements around any particular figure will in fact draw unto him persons who will seek to breach that **security**.

* -I think there is too much visible **security** at the moment.

* One instance about **security** arrangements to which I would point is that where they cover persons such as the Leader of the Opposition, he is entitled to expect that any documentation that he makes of his movements to a **security** organisation or to persons who are responsible for his **security** are kept absolutely confidential.

* In 1976 the then Prime Minister called for the diaries of people who were responsible for the **security** of a former Prime Minister.

* I think that must cause a breakdown because the persons concerned have to accept that their movements are not secure or confidential with regard to any meetings or anything else that they arrange; in the name of **security** they can be documented, can be called for by the Prime Minister and are available to the Government.

* One of the problems with the **security** arrangements at Parliament House is that they can inhibit seriously a person seeking to see a member of parliament.

* Members of the public may be inhibited by **security** arrangements.

* I would like to refer to a number of other matters while I am speaking about **security**.

* I would like to raise one point which the Prime Minister could determine relatively quickly which would greatly enhance the **security** arrangements in this building.

* If this were done **security** arrangements would be that much easier.

* I would like to make one other point about **security**.

* Yes, four contracts are currently held by private **security** organisations to protect Commonwealth buildings and property in the A.C.T.

* Something about which I am concerned and about which I know the Minister for Social **Security** is concerned is the welfare of those pensioners who are at the very bottom of the rung - for instance, the ones who do not own their own homes.

* That for the survival of mankind and the lasting **security** of nations, sovereignty over the means of making war must be passed to the citizens of a unitary world.

* Since he has given no **security** classification whatsoever to these communications (Hansard, 7th April 1971, page 1549), will he table them?

* That for the survival of mankind and the lasting **security** of nations, sovereignty over the means of making war must be passed to the citizens of a unitary world.

* This would not be practicable having regard to the continuing need for personnel to be retained in the theatre to pack and ensure the **security** of equipment etc.

* As Australia is now a member of the **Security** Council of the United Nations, does the Government propose any initiative relating to the situation in the Middle East 
The Treasury referred the matter to the Reserve Bank, which informed my constituent's solicitor that no trace of any **security**, in  Mr Henry's  name has been found'.

* The actions of the Minister for Social **Security** in attempting to cover up secret negotiations aimed at amending the Government's proposed health scheme.

* -As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said, the Opposition has considered the amendment moved by the Minister on behalf of the Government and agrees with it.

* Mr Staley said he hoped  Dr Klugman  would persuade the Social **Security** Minister,  Mr Hayden,  to change the advertisements.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has had discussions with the United Kingdom authorities who are studying the problems of defending the North Sea installations.

* The means test on the NEAT allowance in common with all other means tests will be examined in the course of the operations of the review of income **security**.

* These issues are being considered by an Interdepartmental Committee comprising the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs, Social **Security**, and Employment and Industrial Relations.

* It just does not do to run a little publicity campaign in favour of **security** for the nation's defence secrets.

* Will Australian workmen be engaged to construct the high **security** offshore animal quarantine station on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

* This would provide a measure of **security** of supply for the two largest cities in the Commonwealth in the event of interruption to supply from either gas field.

* Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I am interested to hear the honourable member's reaction to and concern about the employment situation in Western Australia.

* However, apparently the honourable member and some of the unions he supports have not been very concerned about the employment **security** of people of an area in which a continuing spate of strikes has prevented the use of Australia's export capacity and to a degree undermined our reputation as a reliable supplier.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I preface my question by reminding him that he said in this House this week that adopted children who received Medibank cards in the name given by their natural mother and not their present name did so because of neglect to advise the Department of Social **Security** of the correct name.

* I therefore ask him: Why would a child adopted 4 years ago, whose present name was advised to the Department of Social **Security** 4 years ago, whose endowment has been paid in that name for 4 years- this is verified by checking- and who is recorded by the Department of Social **Security** in that name, still this week get his Medibank card in the christian names given by his natural mother, causing very considerable distress?

* Will the Minister who has guaranteed confidentiality and secrecy, now tell us where Medibank does get its information, because in this and other cases it did not and could not have got it from Department of Social **Security** and child endowment records?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I would like to summarise what His Honour had to say.

* The fact that they have been there for so long ought not to represent a great deal of consolation or **security** of tenure for them, in view of the clear indications that there were going to be new concepts applying to these situations.

* The Department of Social **Security** will also pay all unemployment sickness, and special benefits a week in advance during the holiday period.

* Controls over the behaviour of financial institutions can be a desirable supplement to market measures for the purpose of monetary policy and they can be used to protect investors where the financial **security** of their investments might be jeopardised.

* In conjunction with my colleagues, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street),  I have been studying both short and long term measures which will be brought forward quickly for consideration by the Government including possible ways of converting the payment of unemployment benefits within communities into the funding of worthwhile work projects.

* The close involvement of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in this way will also be reflected in our desire for a greater involvement by other specialised Government departments such as Social **Security** and Employment and Industrial Relations.

* An announcement of Government assistance to build a large high **security** international convention centre.

* Engage in studies and analyses of long range international **security** affairs and strategic issues and recommend appropriate policies.

* It is not the practice to give information which would either confirm or refute allegations of particular activities of the Australian **Security**, Intelligence Organisation.

* The main argument that has been advanced for their purchase has been that **security** and more overseas travel are involved.

* I submit that the reason advanced by the Government- **security**- for the purchase of the aircraft is spurious.

* The argument that Qantas cannot provide adequate **security** for a Prime Minister is a specious argument and false.

* In addition, I would like to refer to the report tabled last week by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet relating to overseas travel by the Prime Minister 'Assessment of Aircraft **Security** Considerations'.

* The following appears: 
There are still some **security** risks, but in our judgment acceptable risks, involved in a Qantas charter aircraft specially chartered for the visit throughout and carrying no other cargo or passengers; 
This is an assessment based on **security** grounds.

* In certain circumstances involving direct Qantas commercial flights, flying by commercially scheduled services may be acceptable as far as **security** of a Prime Minister is concerned.

* Mr Fraser claims that there are 'overwhelming' **security** reasons for the Federal Government's decision to buy two Boeing 727 aircraft for its VIP fleet.

* That editorial goes on to say that it was the present Government, when in Opposition, that ridiculed  Mr Whitlam's  1974 proposal made at a time, and I emphasise this, when aircraft hijackings and bomb scares were more prevalent than they are now, to buy two 707s for the VIP fleet for **security** reasons.

* The  Mirror  of 8 May says: 
Of all the transparent hog-wash being given to us at the moment the excuse that we need two VIP Boeing 727s on grounds of **security** is the hardest to swallow.

* For all of this, the reason put forward by the Government is **security**.

* I believe sincerely that we have a Prime Minister who has in him a confrontation streak; that he likes to create confrontation, and when one creates confrontation one generates a need for greater **security** forces.

* Chief Inspector Bryan Harding, the  deputy  head of the **security** operation at the University, offered quite stringent criticism of the behaviour of the Prime Minister on that occasion.

* As recently as a few weeks ago the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said that many successive conservative governments- the Labor Government could not get co-operation from the Australian Medical Association on this issuehave not seen fit to provide the additional funding that is required to enable not the easing of the means test on fringe benefits but simply the updating of the means test to take account of the decreases in the value of money since 1969.

* The gulf in thinking between Left and Right on how Australia's **security** should be sought and how her relations with other countries - Russia, China, the United States - should be conducted has never been bridged and was not bridged at the last ALP conference, where 'unity' was the  watchcry  so loudly proclaimed.

* The only way the differences can be papered over at election time is by saying as little as possible, by omitting (as did  Mr Whitlam)  any mention of the ANZUS or SEATO treaty, by neglecting (as did  Mr Whitlam)  to express any opinion on such urgent controversies as the recognition of China or Russia's proposed Asian collective **security** system.

* It is utterly laughable to see the Party, which so frequently in public and in private puts forward this sort of tenet, coming into the House today and suggesting that the actions of this Government in trying to ensure that there is a realistic defence 'effort and in trying to ensure that the **security** pf Australia and Australians is preserved is in any way being lessened by the actions of individual members of the Cabinet.

* What were the criteria on which the decision was made to approve the Babcock Australia Holdings Ltd and the **Security** Mills Pty Ltd proposals.

* It is the Government's policy to implement the United Nations **Security** Council's Resolutions imposing sanctions on Southern Rhodesia, especially those 
The Australian Government certainly supports that contention.

* We regret that the **Security** Council was unable to come to a decision on this matter before adjourning. 
)

* If for reasons of **security** he is unwilling to make it public, will he quote the full paragraph in which the reference to the 15 years is summarised.

* February it can turn its attention to what should be the first concern of the Australian Parliament, that is, the **security** and continued existence of the Australian people?

* -Clause 5 (b) deals with activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the defence forces of their functions or the carrying out of other activities related to the **security** and defence of the Commonwealth.

* The Opposition is proposing that this clause be qualified by stating that the activities which obstruct or hinder our defence forces must be regarded as unlawful before the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation would be in a position to take some notice of them and to obtain, correlate or evaluate intelligence about them.

* The Opposition is saying that our **security** force would not be able to carry out its function of obtaining, correlating and evaluating intelligence in order to protect our defence forces.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is not designed to stop people from doing what they want to do.

* No consequences flow from a person's directly obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance of the defence forces except the consequence of allowing the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to collect and evaluate information about people who are carrying out those activities.

* How can the Opposition find that consequence objectionable in the context of our defence forces whose function it is to protect the **security** of the country?

* It is a responsible function of the **Security** Organisation to protect our defence forces and collect information to ensure that it is free and able to carry out its proper role of defending and protecting this country.

* to (3) The answer to the Question bears a **Security** classification that cannot be made public without disclosing an operational capability of the RAN and RAAF.

* What discussions have taken place with (a) the Department of Social **Security** and (b) the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs about implementation of the report.

* Fully supports the Resolutions of the General Assembly, the **Security** Council and the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations on Cyprus; 
Is he satisfied that adequate **security** exists to protect telephone communications to the Department of Defence and other national key points in Canberra.

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The reason that I suggested that the honourable member should approach the Department of Social **Security** was not based on a moral judgment.

* According to the Minister for Finance, the Government is going to be cutting back on social **security**, health and education programs.

* In the third largest Greek speaking city in the world there is a migrant service welfare section eroding away in the Department of Social **Security**.

* In 1974 we transferred the section from the Department of Labor and Immigration to the Department of Social **Security**.

* For some reason the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  carries far more weight in her party than does the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  whose performance is causing some concern even in his own ranks.

* Despite what the Minister for Social **Security** says, staff numbers have not been maintained to meet needs under this Government.

* Whenever the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs are challenged they quote figures for the whole branch rather than for the migrant welfare section.

* This matter is a question for the Minister for Repatriation and the Minister for Social **Security**.

* But service pensions and social **security** pensions are subject to a means test at this stage, and when the means test provisions have been applied the medical entitlement card, of course, has been taken away from the pensioner concerned.

* It is a question for consideration not only by the Minister for Repatriation but also by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I will further consult with the Minister for Repatriation and the Minister for Social **Security** in respect of this question.

* Samuel Seymour Investments Pty Ltd by **Security** Mills Pty Ltd; 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
An independent aged person who decides that he will try to save enough to invest in securities in order to look after himself in his old age will be faced with swingeing taxation which takes about 50 per cent from the companies from which his dividends are derived and a further tax upon the dividend, which at the moment amounts to three-quarters of the dividend that he might receive and which, of course, diminishes downwards.

* One of the companies in which such a person might invest for, as he might have thought, his **security** is the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, whose shareholders are not wealthy people who smoke cigars and drive around in Mercedes motor cars.

* I do not know whether, when people play for **security** in this way, that is the way in which to get economic progress.

* Indirectly, through their effects on the general level of costs and prices, they also affect the Commonwealth's outlays on purchases of goods and services, indexed social **security** benefits and grants and advances to other sectors, including the States.

* I believe that a country, in its corporate state, is entitled to protect itself and when there is any attempt to infringe that corporate integrity and **security** it is entitled to resort to all forms in order to ward off those who would seek to destroy it.

* When a person seeks to destroy the **security** and integrity of the state, I must confess that no consideration of deterrence goes through my mind, I say unhesitatingly that the community is entitled to resort to retribution.

* The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The Department of Social **Security** has not used management consultant firms for any purpose in the last 12 months.

* Lending institutions are properly concerned with the **security** of people 's personal savings.

* For reasons of **security** i am not at liberty to divulge this information publicly, but I have written to the honourable member privately on this part of the question.

* where any document referred to in paragraph (c) was withheld for **security** reasons, a statement indicating the subject and classification of that document.

* Customs and Excise, and shadow Minister for Social **Security**, Health, Repatriation and Compensation, and a former Leader of the House.

* The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  a former Minister for Social **Security**, also resigned because of his opposition to the Government's economic policy.

* Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Since 2 December 1972 no applications for Australian citizenship have been refused as a result of Australian **security** reports.

* It would 6e in Australia's interests to support Papua New Guinea in the event of an external threat to that nation's **security**.

* -I direct the attention of the Attorney-General to the fact that the Committee is dealing with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill.

* I ) to (3) It has been the long standing practice of successive Australian Governments not to disclose matters relating to **security** intelligence.

* The Australian people must ask themselves what the Labor Party's policy on tariffs means for their future economic **security**.

* Job **security** and peace of mind for the ordinary working man and woman must be shattered.

asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 7 October 1978: 
 In the brief time which is all that the Government has left us, I wish to deal with clause 34 of the Health Insurance Bill.

* With the changed insurance scheme - the so-called new insurance scheme introduced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  which is being proposed in this Bill - it is certain that there will be substantial changes in hospital bed use, and this will have significant consequences.

* I must say that there are a couple of good features in this Bill but they could easily be incorporated into the existing health scheme without the destruction of all the good things in the existing scheme and without the incorporation of the many bad features that are also in this scheme produced by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 1 October 1978: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 1 March 1979: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 1 August 1979: 
What job **security** provisions have been made by the Government to provide protection of employment for those persons affected by the new technology.

* This Government has shown that it will continue to prop up our society with massive handouts of social **security** benefits.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 3 1 May 1979: 
I come now to the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy).

* The head of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation said that the remarks of the Attorney-General were gravely damaging to ASIO.

* What I can say is that in recent days the United Kingdom Government has submitted a recommendation to the United Nations **Security** Council asking for confirmation that the unilateral declaration of independence is illegal and uncon stitutional.

* This morning when I was making my statement I refered to an assessment of aircraft **security** considerations that had been undertaken.

* The particular report on which I presume the Attorney-General relies - with all the care and circumspection that marks the chief officer of the law, the Minister in charge of Australian **security** - is one which the honourable member for Lalor has twice corrected to the newspaper in which it appeared.

* Further to that the Government has established offices of the Department of Social **Security**, offices of the Department of Labor and Immigration, welfare offices and community centres.

* I suggest that if the Government wants  Mr Justice  Hope to hold any inquiry then it should set up an inquiry headed by him to find out just what did happen at the Hilton Hotel on Monday morning of last week, how it happened and who was responsible for the obvious failures in the general nature of **security** at that hotel.

* I am convinced, the more I consider the Prime Minister's statement and look at the way in which this matter has been handled subsequently, that the Prime Minister has sought, one way or another, to create a diversionary tactic to take public interest away from the serious shortcomings in the **security** arrangements of the Government at the Hilton Hotel last week.

* It is welcome in that efforts will be made to provide efficient and satisfactory **security** arrangements to meet future civilian requirements.

* It is welcome that efforts will be made to co-ordinate civilian resources to handle civilian **security** matters in the future.

* Frankly, I feel uneasy about the way in which the Prime Minister shows a preoccupation with **security** matters; more than that, an anxiousness to become personally involved in such matters.

* His assumption of total authority for the **security** operations following the unfortunate incident at the Hilton Hotel last week while probably not legal, I repeat, appeared to give an insight into what can only be described as a worrying strain in his make-up.

* I cannot accept that our senior experienced military people, our senior experienced **security** advisers, our senior experienced Australia and State police officers would be less experienced, less alert, less intuitively responsive than the Prime Minister in handling this difficult operation.

* For my part, I strongly suspect that there is more than enough legislative authority to provide adequate **security** protection from civilian resources for civilian purposes in the future in the event of a similar need to that which occurred last week in Sydney arising.

* While **security** measures should be reviewed in the light of last week's bombing, the issue must be kept in perspective.

* There can be no doubt that what has been done up there has been done in the interests of proper development for the Northern Territory, in the interests of the people who live there and in the interests of giving them sewerage, electricity, lighting, **security** of title and a good life.

* Five years ago he was prepared to continue a divisive policy of conscription claiming that it was essential to national **security**.

* Obviously he opposes the increases in social **security** payments during the last few months.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
That Vietnam has never been, nor will be in the foreseeable future, any threat to Australian **security**, or to the Australian way of life.

* We hope to scrap the present confusing system of pensions and social **security** benefits and replace it with a more simply administered and more easily understood system of guaranteed income.

* Handicapped people will be given the same consideration as other employees for continuity and **security** of work and .for advancement opportunities.

* Having regard to the sanctions imposed against Rhodesia by decisions of the United Nations **Security** Council the Government had decided: 
There has been no approval given for the establishment of an office of the Department of Social **Security** in Port Augusta, South Australia.

* After consultation with the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Health, the Committee shall report to the Prime Minister.

* The Prime Minister will recall an earlier question today in which I asked whether he was aware of the raids by  Senator Murphy  on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Canberra and Melbourne.

There is also an acceptance throughout European countries and in Japan and a great many other countries that if they are to have the energy that they need to keep their own industries going and to keep their homes warm in the winter, they will need to rely increasingly on nuclear generated electricity.

* That affects our **security** as it affects everyone 's **security**.

* It does not help Australian **security** at all for Australia to stay out of the business of selling uranium and let other people do it in the way that may be less secure and less safe than if Australia itself had been involved.

* So, Australian **security** in the longer term, as well as world **security** in relation to proliferation, is a significant part of what we are about.

* As tourism is a form of trade, can he inform the House whether this display contravenes the sanctions of the United Nations **Security** Council agreed to by Australia?

* When did he and the Minister for Social **Security** ask the Prime Minister whether they could examine alternative sources of funding.

* Australia, like every other country, has the inalienable right to determine the composition of its population, the rate of its development and the measures to be taken to guard its **security**.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
I would like to say something first about the political issues with which the visit has been concerned.

* The Prime Minister had pointed out the need for a relationship between the United States the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Japan and Europe that would enhance the **security** of medium and small powers, of which, of course, Australia is one, medium and small countries that may be small in size and in material resources but which are nevertheless significant.

and (4) It is understood that in the course of discussions on a wide range of subjects, at Bonn in July 1969, an official of the West German Ministry of Labour requested the then Minister for Immigration to take up with the Australian Goverment the question of a social **security** agreement.

* For too long these people have been disappointed, disparaged and defeated and what they needed so desperately was a clear unambiguous victory and the new **security** which would accompany such a victory.

* For example, grants paid through the Department of Social **Security** in 1976-77 to the good neighbour councils alone will total $ 1.22m.

* This is the role of the Department of Social **Security** and other relevant departments of State, which are under direct ministerial control.

* This work will be undertaken within the Department of Social **Security**.

* The meeting of State Social Welfare Ministers held in Darwin on 2 1 May 1976 identified social welfare manpower planning as of vital importance and the Minister for Social **Security** has agreed to the Minister's request that the work initiated by the Social Welfare Commission in this area be continued, with more direct involvement of the States as they are major users of welfare manpower.

* The Minister for Social **Security** agreed that her department should undertake work immediately in this area seeking the co-operation of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in setting up a working party, comprising representatives of relevant Commonwealth and State government departments, to examine questions of the standardisation and adequacy of social welfare statistics and the desirability of convening a national conference on these matters.

* Did it lead to  a  justification for  Senator Murphy's  raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation?

* We believe in our national **security** and that we should take a responsible place in our geographical region and in world affairs.

* Compiled at request by the Legislative Research Service from information supplied by the Department of Social **Security**.

* Mr HAYDEN (Oxley - Minister for Social **Security**) - I wish to make a personal explanation.

* As is the case with the Department of Social **Security**, this Association has no information as to the extent to which the practice is applied to patients.

* Department of Social **Security** offices are operating in the following non-metropolitan cities and towns.

* Has his attention also been drawn to indexed item 99- Statistics on **security** mail interception.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question.

* Social **Security** 
The Minister for Social **Security** has povided the following answer to the right honourable member's question.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
1 ) What action has he taken to expedite the construction of the high **security** animal quarantine station.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following table in answer to the honourable member's question: 
) Yes.

* Commonwealth car drivers are subject to **security** checking upon commencement of employment.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following table in answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following table in answer to the honourable member's question: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following table in answer to the honourable member's question: 
Today we are dealing with a package of measures designed to provide a legislative structure for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The present- the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act 1956- is skeletal, vacuous and perfunctory.

* We in Australia have no cause for smugness about the performance of our own **security** organisations in the past.

* In his report on intelligence and **security**  Mr Justice  Hope stated: 
There are limitations upon what a **security** organisation should do in a democratic society.

* Aims, even of **security**, do not justify all means.

* Evidence is available to me that satisfies me that ASIO has in the past provided selected people with **security** intelligence material for publication.

* The second major cause of concern is the scope of **security** activity.

* We desire a redefinition of the concept of **security**, in particular of the critical element of subversion.

* The third major concern is the need to balance **security** requirements against the right to privacy of individual citizens; that is, whatever **security** needs there may be for bugging and wire tapping, those needs have to be balanced very firmly against the right of the individual to privacy.

* Our fourth major field of concern is that we want to look at the **security** appeal system.

* It seems to me that in this Bill the Government is insufficiently sensitive to the threat posed by a **security** service with a dangerous degree of autonomy.

* There has been a tendency over the years for ministers to take the intelligence **security** business for granted or to leave it to go its own way.

* In the case of **security** that criticism is essential.

* **Security** is just too important to be left to this unholy duo of Executive and bureaucracy.

* It is simply nonsense to suggest that useful information on these matters could not be provided to Parliament without endangering **security** of ASIO personnel.

* Such a report would give away no **security** secrets.

* Indeed, it might suggest how active our **security** is.

* Another problem besetting the financial system which has been excluded from the terms of reference of this inquiry- it affects large numbers of potential home buyers- is the lack of **security** for building society funds.

* In the first place, I believe that we ought to support the concept that Israel has the right to exist, that it must not be exterminated and that it has the right to so exist with **security** and with a guarantee of peace.

* If on the other hand we are to be told by the senior law officer of the Crown, as we should be told if it is true, that he agrees there is not sufficient evidence in which to bring a charge, then all the attack made by the Prime Minister this afternoon falls completely to the ground and it is shown instead for what it is - an attempt to divert attention from the damaging attack on national **security** which his Attorney-General made; to divert attention from that by making unsustainable and false accusations against the previous Government.

* But if the report from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation member at that committee meeting was true - and we have been told it was false - why does that suggest evidence of conspiracy amongst public servants?

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 19 September 1978: 
What co-ordinative and consultative arrangements presently exist between the Department of Social **Security** and each of the State governments.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (J), (2) and (3) Where a pensioner takes in lodgers to obtain company and additional **security**, money paid for lodging would not be included as income in assessing pension entitlement.

* This is one area to which I would ask the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Wheeldon)  to give very serious attention.

* The Opposition's attitude shows not the gulf but the chasm which exists between the Government and the Opposition in regard to policies on the defence and **security** of the country.

* The Department of Labor and Immigration has opened an office in the same area, as has the Department of Social **Security**.

* 1 ) Does the Commonwealth Employment Service inform the Department of Social **Security** of persons registered for unemployment who refuse an offer of suitable employment.

* Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  tried to shunt the blame off on to the Public Service Board.

* The Prime Minister also said: 
In his second reading speech the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said that the question of appeals under the provisions of the Health Insurance Bill being transferred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would be taken up when the tribunal commenced to operate.

* As advances in many cases are being given to those who have ample **security** which would meet the requirements of normal banking proposals, will the Minister contract the Queensland Government and/or the board to ask that need be given first priority in their considerations?

* Will the Minister arrange for a reallocation of funds available so that other States will not be given excess funds determined on a formula basis so that Queensland- 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
As a result of those policies, as a result of improved capability in Vietnam and as a result of the **security** operations over many years by the Task Force itself, ;he process of Vietnamisation has started to move in such a way that areas of prime military responsibility are now being handed over to the regional force companies.

* This is the very objective of the whole enterprise - so that the South Vietnamese can maintain **security** on their own in certain areas and ultimately over the whole of the territory.

* Our objective in this area is an objective which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition would, from his own statements over the last few days, support but how can he support it if he is not prepared to take the measure necessary for the adequate **security** and protection of the South Vietnamese people?

* Our objective, in conjunction with allies is to achieve a situation in South Vietnam of sufficient **security** so that the South Vietnamese can maintain themselves.

* I think that honourable members will like to read the report when it is available in Australia because it does emphasise that although America is withdrawing its ground troops from Asia it still regards the Pacific area as vital to its **security**.

* We know how vital this is to our **security**.

* I think the significance of the change in Labor policy at Launceston needs to be considered because the effect of that decision is to eliminate the military aspects, the defence and **security** aspects, of ANZUS.

* How many applications for naturalisation have been refused as a result of Australian **security** reports since 2 December 1972. 
jeopardises the savings and future **security** of Australians holding life assurance policies; 
and (2) The physical **security** measures at Maralinga comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency Information Circular 225 of September 1975.

-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The honourable member for Hotham, who was the Minister for Social **Security** in the temporary government just after 1 1 November- I am not quite sure what its official title was - 
It was known as the caretaker government.

* The honourable member told us that on behalf of the Liberal and National Country Parties he presented the policy on social **security**.

* In that policy he referred to instant and automatic increases of pensions and other social **security** payments.

* At the present time pensioners and other social **security** recipients with children receive $7.50 per week for each dependent child.

* In the case of pensioners or other social **security** recipients with only one child, the amount of money involved would be relatively little.

* At this stage I would pay a tribute to the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  who was the Minister for Social **Security** for most of the time in the Whitlam Labor Government.

* He did a tremendous amount of work to improve social **security** benefits and the approach to them, during the time he was the Minister, a period of some two and a half years.

* I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a table setting out social **security** benefits and the changes to them between October 1972 and November 1975.

* For instance, social **security** and social welfare programs may best be administered by local government instead of by the Federal Government or a State government; it may well be that programs conducted by State or local government could best be conducted federally.

* The report brings out that we must do more to assist in the work of moving towards a permanent and peaceful settlement in the region based on the recognition of Israel 's right to exist in **security**, on the encouragement of Arab initiatives to settle the displaced Palestinians and also on the efforts of President Carter and other world leaders at the present time.

* I do not think that anyone would seriously suggest that an ombudsman should be able to probe highly confidential Cabinet decisions on matters of high policy affecting the **security** of the nation.

* It was because of this that this scheme was first brought into being and it is only through this scheme that we have been able to develop large areas of country and give the farmers **security** of water supplies.

* I am pleased that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who is now in this chamber, have agreed to keep that program alive.

* It received enthusiastic approval from the then Opposition spokesman on social **security**, now  Senator Chipp.

* In an internal Department of Social **Security** report it is stated: 
The article talks about three men at this hostel who are 24 years of age.

* I hope that the Minister for Health will convey my remarks to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I hope that the Minister for Health, who is at the table, will convey these thoughts to the Minister for Social **Security**, in the other place.

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* In fact, as spokesman for the Opposition on these matters I commend the Government and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for bringing in this Bill.

* I now pay a compliment to the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  who is not in the chamber tonight but who is being represented by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I raised this matter with my friend, the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I raised this matter with the Minister for Social **Security**, who referred me to the Minister for Health.

* The Bill also includes a number of administrative amendments, including those that will transfer the administration of the medical and hospital benefits scheme and the pensioner medical service from the Department of Health to the Department of Social **Security**.

* I do not know what sinister purpose the Minister for Social **Security** has for putting this provision before the Parliament, but 1 accept it now on behalf of the Opposition with the reservation that I will have much more to say about it on Thursday.

* I cannot let this occasion pass without referring to a rather ironical statement made by the Minister for Social **Security** in introducing the Bill.

* He said: 
My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* He has compounded the joke by asking the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to think up ways of spending the $50,000.

* The same situation applies to one of the commitments of the Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Guilfoyle,  who went to the Italian community in Melbourne and made a great play of donating $5,000 to FILEF, which is an Italian welfare organisation.

* Now either the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs or the Minister for Social **Security** wants to get rid of a lynch-pin in the organisation.

* Several others are mentioned at page 35 of the annual report of the Department of Social **Security** for 1974-75.

* There has been a problem in regard to **security**, in that mail bags are emptied in one place and have to be taken some considerable distance to the post office itself.

* Perhaps we should call in Sherlock Holmes or someone who knows about **security** as the issue concerns a petition presented a few weeks ago in which 500 names were involved but approximately 23 names appear on the petition.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* What was the expenditure by each department and instrumentality in 1970-71 on watching and **security** services.

* Department of Social **Security**: Inter-departmental Committees (Question No.

* This matter does not come within the responsibility of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Australia's finance, the future **security** of Australians, their employment opportunities and their welfare.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I pay a tribute to the many members of the various departments who have been very cooperative over the years.

* I refer particularly to officers in the Australian Postal Commission, the Australian Telecommunications Commission, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social **Security**.

* In view of the administrative cost of at least $10 in processing and forwarding a single letter to a pensioner advising him or her of pension variations of as little as 5c per week, and in view of the petty and annoying character of such letters, will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Social **Security**, investigate the feasibility of in future applying and notifying only pension increases or reductions which are in excess of $ 1 per fortnight?

-The misrepresentations and platitudes ladled out to the electorate and to the Parliament by the Prime Minister (Malcolm Fraser) and his Cabinet have found no clearer expression than in the section of the Governor-General's Speech relating to **security** matters, where he said: 
My Government has accepted the basic conclusions of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* The functions, responsibilities and powers of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, which have been reviewed, will be clearly defined by legislation.

* The Prime Minister announced to this Parliament in October last year and also in a letter to the Premier of South Australia in January of this year that the recommendations of the Hope report would be used as the basis for a sweeping range of reforms and amendments to the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation Act.

* The inspection of hundreds of files and the examination of numbers of witnesses, including officers of ASIO, have satisfied me that some **security** assessments it has provided have been wrong.

* Is there no limit to the lengths to which the forces of reaction in this country will go in relation to what they define as national **security** or as being in the national interest?

* Later I will examine more closely what is meant by 'national **security**' and 'national interest'.

* a mass of records (indeed, the greater part of Special Branch records) relating to matters, organisations and persons having no connection whatsoever with genuine **security** risks .

* The compiling of select files regarding public **security** can only be assured by spying on lawabiding individuals.

* Well-placed **security** officials say there is no direct evidence to link the bombing with any international terrorist groups, or with the first stage of an attempt to intimidate the Federal Government by generating hysteria through a series of IRA-type bombings in Sydney.

* The Prime Minister's reaction has ranged from the calling out of the military to a paranoic obsession with **security**- an obsession which may threaten the liberties of the Australian people.

* However, in setting himself up as a self-styled **security** supremo, in mounting the largest ever domestic **security** operation in Australia's history, the Prime Minister has brought this possibility closer to realisation.

* Where any particular intelligence or matter is or might be relevant to **security** for the purpose of the Act.

* Although in some democracies there are parliamentary committees for the supervision of the **security** service, such an arrangement would be inappropriate in Australia.

* It is a pretty fair indication of the state of mind of people whom honourable members on the other side of the House would put in control of organisations such as the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, which has direct power over the lives of people in this country.

* I wish to raise one further point and it relates to the statement made by the  Speaker  of this House on Thursday, 2 March regarding the **security** of Parliament.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
If so, did the Minister for Social **Security** seek his advice prior to the approval of these projects; if so, when; if not, why not.

Department of Social **Security**: Office at Port Augusta (Question No.

* 2177) 
It is not the practice of this Government to give information which may have the effect of endangering **security**.

* The total outlay on social **security** and general welfare items is 27.8 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays, an increase from $7,490.3m last year to $8,0 14.7m this year.

* He criticised this Government for not increasing old age and social **security** pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly income in accordance with the plan of the Labor Government.

* The truth is that we have improved the situation with regard to social **security** pensioners.

* ls he able to say whether, under the Social **Security** Act of the United Kingdom, an employee who is unemployed by reason of a strike conducted by his own union, is entitled to receive supplementary social **security** benefits in respect of a wife and children as well as a rent allowance?

* I refer to the strike by employees of the Hospital Employees Union in Queensland at the Challenor Centre and Wolston Park hospital situated in the electorate of Oxley, represented in this House by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  and at Baillie Henderson Hospital in Toowoomba.

* We note how quiet the Minister for Social **Security** is on this most important issue.

* Where has been the voice of the Minister for Social **Security**?

* The scheme also attempts to provide some form of **security** for future planning within the industry.

* As a refinance institution, staff will be kept to a minimum and **security** and other documentation held and processed by the on-lending financial body.

* In relation to other advances- that is, predominantly those on longer term loans, land and **security** of land- the general restraints now applying to the Development Bank will continue.

* Does that mean that the trading banks as providers of credit have lost their audacity and prefer to put their funds into the safe **security** of government bonds yielding, as a minimum, something over 5 per cent?

* The Committee tabled its report on 20 September 1973 and concluded that there was a need to establish a high **security** animal quarantine station on an island remote from the mainland.

* Since there were only a small group present on 2nd March at the departmental and agencies meeting which was allegedly plotting against the Government, why has it taken more than 2 weeks to ascertain whether or not a one-sentence report of a single decision recorded by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representative was accurate?

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 10 May 1979: 
1 ) How many (a) temporary and (b) permanent staff are currently located at the Department of Social **Security** offices at 176 Parramatta Road, Camperdown, NSW.

* Where in the Electoral Division of Sydney are other Department of Social **Security** offices located and how many 
Yet the consequences of an election this year will appal everyone and not the least those who are appalled by the record ofthe Labor Government.

* With it would come the certainty that no Government would be able to take tough economic measures with any sort of electoral **security**.

* As I tried to suggest at the beginning, had it not been for the fact that this Government has a thing about the word 'Australia' and a preference for the antiquated word 'Commonwealth', I doubt whether it would have been necessary to institute the measure other than to cover the fact that the Federal Government might have become liable to pay State duties because of this new sort of **security** which perhaps had not been covered when the Act was written.

* (5)In what ways can the incidence of abortion be reduced by improving services and facilities such as sex education in schools, family planning clinics, supply of contraceptives, pregnancy support agencies, adoption agencies and social **security** payments.

* A little later I shall seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  a table which shows that the Department of Social **Security** is projecting an increase in the consumer price index of 7 per cent for that period.

* Judging by the sort of figures that the Department of Social **Security** is working on it is clear, by implication, that inflation by the end of this financial year is going to be little better, if at all, than for the financial year just completed.

* When I was Minister for Social **Security** I was conscious of the.fact that some people, and not too many of them relatively, will abuse any system and that the more we try to toughen up a system to catch the person who abuses or misuses the system the harder we make it for decent responsible people who have a need for that benefit, a need arising from no fault of their own.

* It looks like political diddling of the books and I suggest that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  ought to clarify this in the interests of the integrity of the Ministry, the Government, the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who in this House represents the Minister for Social **Security**, and the Minister for Social **Security** herself.

* The next matter that concerns the Opposition is the supplementary benefit which is paid to people of extremely limited means, as assessed for social **security** benefit payments, and who have to pay rent.

* There are many people, with dependants, in receipt of social **security** benefits who are among the most needy in this community and it is a most inglorious chapter in the social **security** history of this country that so little is being done for these people.

* Again I quote from a table included in the Department of Social **Security**'s annual report for 1974-75.

* I also have the figure for the May 1977 increase in pension based upon a departmental projection of the Department of Social **Security** of an anticipated increase of about $3 a week in the standard rate and $2.50 a week in the married rate.

* It is a table prepared in the Department of Social **Security** for internal use.

* Every word we heard this morning from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  and the Opposition spokesman on health and social **security**, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  showed clearly that they are out of touch with the health care services upon which an overwhelming majority of Australian families are obliged to rely.

* Committee of the **Security** Council and does not directly involve the Australian Government.

* Which departments and instrumentalities have engaged the services of watching and **security** companies.

* DESIRING to regulate their mutual relationship in the field of Social **Security**.

* No one is threatening our **security** for the next 10 to 15 years.

* by reason that it would prejudice the **security**, defence or international relations of Australia; 
1 ) Is the Income **Security** Review Group still in existence.

* the need to establish a nuclear safeguards, safety and **security** commission.

* Is it also a fact that the Department of Social **Security** is still excluded; if so, why.

* Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Australian Jewish News of Nth July 1972 in which  Dr El-Hafez, President  of the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the Lebanese Parliament, and at that date a guest of his Department, in commenting on accusations that armed men, using Lebanon as a **security** haven, launch attacks on Israel or areas controlled by Israel, was reported as saying that there are Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon but denying that they, are terrorists, that there is a resistance movement which has a right to fight for Palestine but denying that they receive help from Government of Lebanon and denying also that the Government has any responsibility to police their infiltration into neighbouring 'occupied Palestine' which he believes is the responsibility of the Israeli Police.

* Does the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation have a charter to operate overseas.

* Department of Social **Security** as required for cross checks of eligibility.

* **Security** Co-ordinator-  Mr W.  J. McLaren 
Chubb Fire **Security** Ltd- (a) England, (b) England; 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 23 August 1978: 
1 ) Under what policy and machinery guidelines do officers of the Department of Social **Security** determine the existence of a domestic arrangement between, among, or involving recipients of single rate welfare benefits or pensions.

* We have indexed social **security** pensions and we have introduced family allowances.

* Commonwealth Employment Service staff are under instructions not to refuse any claims for unemployment benefit as the determination of such claims is a matter for the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
The Department of Social **Security** was formed in December 1972 from an amalgamation of the former Department of Social Services and the Health Insurance and Benefits Division of the Department of Health.

* -I ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen reports that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is once again to infiltrate and spy upon trade unions m Australia.

* On 12 August 1974 the United Nations **Security** Council unanimously adopted Resolution 356(1974) recommending the admission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to membership of the United Nations and on 18 August 1975 it adopted similar resolutions, also unanimously, in respect of the Republic of Cape Verde (372 (1975)), the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe (373 (1975)), and the People's Republic of Mozambique (374 (1975)).

* On 23 June 1976 the **Security** Council considered a draft resolution recommending the admission of the People's Republic of Angola to membership of the United Nations.

* The voting was as follows: 
I now come to the matter of social **security** and the increase in the pension.

* Any **security** service has to depend on the integrity of those two people.

* Finally, in the interests of regional co-operation and **security**, will Australia associate itself with the aspirations of its neighbours and allies in the region?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What are the rights of a member of the House of Representatives to inquire, on behalf of constituents, into specific cases in the Department of Social **Security**.

* Nations **Security** Council's resolution of 29 May 1968.

* This includes the following: 
am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 March 1 978: 
What expenditures were made under major programs administered by the Department of Social **Security** in the Electoral Division of Werriwa in 1976-77.

* This legislation if passed into law- I hope that the listening public understands this- will give people the right to intercept other people's telephone conversations by using mechanical devices, to intercept their mail, and to prepare dossiers on them on the basis that it is deemed to be done in the cause of **security**.

* Let me go back to how it was originally and naturally suggested that we should have some guidance on the activities of an intelligence organisation that would look after the **security** of this nation.

* In March 1949, the then Prime Minister of Australia,  Mr Chifley,  issued a memorandum to the Director-General of **Security** on the functions of a **security** service.

* The memorandum stated: 
It is your responsibility to keep each Minister informed of all matters affecting **security** coming to your knowledge and which fall within the scope of his Department.

* As Director-General of **Security** you will have direct access to the Prime Minister at all dmes.

* The memorandum stated that the task is to guarantee that the Commonwealth is free from external and internal dangers arising from espionage and sabotage, or from actions of persons and organisations, which may be subversive of the **security** of the Commonwealth.

* The memorandum further stated: 
You will take especial care to ensure that the work of the **Security** Service is strictly limited to what is necessary for the purposes of this task ...

* It is essential that the **Security** Service should be kept absolutely free from any political bias or influence, and nothing should be done that might lend colour to any suggestion that it is concerned with the interests of any particular section of the community .

* Let it be placed on record that Labor governments of the past have appointed two DirectorsGeneral of **Security**, and both of them were judges.

* There never has been that impartial ability to look at what **security** and intelligence are all about.

* **Security** means espionage, sabotage, subversion, active measures of foreign intervention, or terrorism.

* We must get rid of the old-boy network and the idea that because one might have belonged to a **security** organisation one is a privileged person and can go to even higher offices in Public Service.

* The amendment is: that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide- 
b) that regular periodic judicial audit be conducted into the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to ensure- 
that the responsible Minister be fully informed by the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation with respect to any matter, other than the contents of files relating to particular individuals, on which he has sought information and advice; 
that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects of the operation of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, including the exercise of its Special Powers under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill; 
the proper financial accountability of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, including the auditing of its accounts by the Auditor-General, as recommended by the Hope Report; 
the redefinition of the concept of '**security**', and in particular the element of 'subversion ', in order to narrow its scope and limit the possibility of its mis-application; 
that the **security** appeals system be given retrospective operation as recommended in the Hope Report; 
that no person be denied notification of the existence of an adverse **security** assessment made about that person; and 
the communication of information purporting to identify an Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation employee or agent to be penalised only when such information would endanger the safety of such person or itself be seriously prejudicial to **security**.

* We insisted that provision be written into the Act ensuring that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  was properly consulted and advised on **security** matters.

* However, the attitude of the Government in denying us any advanced briefing and refusing us advance copies of the legislation, even on the morning that the legislation was introduced into the Senate, makes a mockery of its claim that it is genuine about a bipartisan consideration of **security**.

* The great challenge in legislation such as this is to balance **security** needs with civil liberties.

* The Hilton Hotel bombing outrage was marked by totally inadequate initial **security** arrangements, followed by an absurd and dangerous overreaction after the event.

* We want to ensure that we have proper and efficient **security** in this country.

* However, a **security** organisation left to its own devices will not meet these requirements.

* The Report of  Mr Justice  White into Special Branch **Security** Records in South Australia is, I believe, an excellent exposition of the concept of subversion.

* I point out that while the Petrov royal commission was not established until April 1954, on the eve of the 1 954 election, the **security** services were gearing up to it considerably before.

* The Minister for Social **Security** and I have been having discussions on ways of funding women's refuges for 1977-78.

* Reciprocal Agreements on Social **Security**  (Question No.

* 768) 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 14 September 1978: 
The matter needs further investigation and it indicates the great importance of maintaining the **security** and integrity of our national archives.

* The cuts I have spoken of include the big spending but political sensitive areas of education, health, urban and regional development, and social **security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
**Security**, upon notice: 
On 22 May 1977 the Government decided to establish an advisory body to advise the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on refugee policy and operations.

* This body is the standing interdepartmental committee on refugees, comprising senior officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (which chairs the committee), Prime Minister and Cabinet, Employment and Industrial Relations, Social **Security**, Finance, Health and Education, with other departments and the Public Service Board being co-opted as necessary.

* As this report is identical with other information submitted to me in writing and known by other departments to be correct, is it the proper interpretation of the words alleged to be used by the foreign affairs officer in the alleged Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation minute that the reply to the Whitlam Government should be consistent with the aide-memoire to the Yugoslav Embassy?

* Lodgement of a minimum **security** of $1,000.

* A couple of weeks ago I received a statement from  Senator Guilfoyle,  the Minister for Social **Security**, listing all the projects and what projects would be funded in this year.

* I have written to the Minister for Social **Security** about this matter.

* I should like to see the Minister for Social **Security** take this step to raise the level of pensioner entitlement card limit to ensure that those people who have an entitlement do not lose it because of an indexation payment.

* I will give honourable members some idea of just what effect this will have on the recipients of social **security** benefits.

* 1 ) Does the delay in finalising arrangements for the high **security** animal quarantine station at Cocos Islands now constitute an unacceptable situation, and will he authorise the construction of the Station on Christmas Island or some other site.

* 1 ) The Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Capital Territory, Employment and Industrial Relations, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Social **Security**, Veterans' Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Northern Territory, together with the Australian Legal Aid Office, the Public Service Board, the Australian Taxation Office, the Health Insurance Commission and the Australian Postal Commission.

* 3), I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a table of increases in social **security** benefits since October 1 972.

* One of the important things to remember is that the table which I have just had incorporated in  Hansard  shows very large increases in social **security** payments.

* The obvious fact is that we have increased social **security** benefits at a very fast rate since we have been in government.

* I take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and the Department of Social **Security** for bringing about all these advances.

* The present Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Wheeldon,  and the previous Minister for Social **Security**, Bill Hayden, who is now the Treasurer, worked very assiduously in persuading the Government as a whole- the Cabinet- to bring about these extra benefits.

* It is ridiculous for an Opposition to block Supply in the way in which this Opposition is doing it at the present time with the result that the persons who have to interview the applicants for social **security** benefits and the people who have to mail the cheques will themselves not be paid.

* Above all, miners who have gone into the bowels of the earth to win its riches for the benefit of all Australians must be given the **security** of full employment and the sanctuary of the home and the community in which they and their families live.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Has the Minister for Social **Security** made any arrangements with suppliers of computer equipment for the operation of the Government's health insurance program?

* There can be no real and lasting **security** for jobs as long as inflation is out of control.

* To show this is a bipartisan view of the link between inflation and unemployment, let me quote something said by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  in his Budget Speech when he was Labor Treasurer in August 1975: He stated: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I support the construction of this facility.

* Some people are worried that the quarantine **security** area is not secure enough.

* I may add that the whole question of funeral benefits for deceased social service pensioners has been referred to the Advisory Council on Social **Security**/ Welfare for examination and advice.

* With which further countries has Australia negotiated comprehensive reciprocal agreements on social **security** since 22 February 1977  (Hansard,  page 33 1 ).

* That this House, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908-1963, authorises the publication of copies of documents from the files of the Attorney-General's Department, the Commonwealth Police and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation relating to Croation terrorist activities in Australia presented to the House this day  by  the Minister representing the Attorney-General.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
What expenditures were made in 1976-77 under major programs administered by the Department of Social **Security** in the electoral divisions of (a) Chifley, (b) Macarthur, (c) 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Is the Department of Social **Security** given access to individuals' taxation records when investigating eligibility for social service payments.

* That ad hockery comes under the heading of short-term expediency rather than the longer-term plans needed to ensure that there will be proper **security** in the motor vehicle industry, which is such an important engine to manufacturing industry in this country.

* We plead that a good deal more be done to ensure the viability of the motor manufacturing industry and thus preserve the job **security** of workers therein.

* Does the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation operate in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea?

* Is he the Minister responsible for the operations of the other **security** organisations in the Territory?

* there being no **security** of tenure for residents living on the Balranald Reserve.

* On 25 May 1973 my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite, asked the then Minister for Social **Security**, the present Leader of the Opposition, this question: 
The honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  inquired at Question Time this morning inter alia whether a representative of IBM was accompanying officers of the Department of Social **Security** presently in Canada.

* At that time I - 
Perhaps I could commence by pointing out that the Department of Social **Security** currently is engaged in an intensive investigation and planning exercise to determine the computer equipment which will be required for its future operations.

* I should point out that most of the equipment used by the Department of Social **Security** is IBM equipment.

* Then the honourable member for Corangamite asked the Minister for Social **Security** the following question upon notice: 
The question was answered on 29 August 1973.

* If my information is correct, tenders were called on 14 June 1 973, only a few weeks after an IBM official had accompanied the officers of the Minister for Social **Security** to Canada to examine computing arrangements.

* The then Minister for Social **Security** gave the following answer: 
I do not think that honourable gentlemen would be particularly interested in a detailed description of the items but the cost of item 1 was $5.

* The Minister for Social **Security** at that time went on to say: 
We are dealing with the astronomical sum of $1,136,988,000.

* But neither in this debate nor in the Minister's statement on defence, have we ever been given  a  systematic account of the threat to our **security** and a detailed and logical exposition of the sort of defence arrangements, including the type of equipment in all Services, that we require to meet this threat.

* Back in 1963 we were told the purchase was vital to our **security**.

* He said: 
House the circumstances under which my fellow countrymen can have a free hand in eroding once hallowed privacy or alternatively will he tell the nation and the State Government that he is not going to tolerate a repetition of the Penridge case in north Queensland or the Berman case in Victoria unless it is a matter of national **security**?

* They lead a life without dignity and without **security**.

* **Security** of employment in Australia ranks among the lowest in the world.

* There is no **security** of employment.

* Today I listened to the honourable member for Fisher  (Mr Adermann)  say that he regarded as a **security** risk the fact that civilian employees in defence establishments were being asked to join unions.

* If that is the kind of Army we have, if that is the kind of defence that is available to us in the event of enemy action against a bridge, the sooner the Minister and this Government are removed from office the better it will be for the **security** of Australia.

* Until the MTN round was concluded there was never any certainty or **security** for the Australian beef industry.

* This arrangement is a wonderful addition to our quota and it provides for the Australian meat industry a **security** which it has never previously achieved.

* If there is one drought year after a lot of wet years there is a grave danger that the Government can be lulled into a false sense of **security**.

* His phenomenal memory might enable him to recall that in January and February 1966 the United States called for an urgent meeting of the **Security** Council to discuss this matter.

* At that time the Australian Government informed its representatives in the United States that it opposed taking Vietnam to the the **Security** Council because it believed- .

* My comments in this debate on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs will deal mainly with the People's Republic of China and, of course, its admission to the United Nations and to its rightful place on the **Security** Council.

* To defend the United States against a Chinese Communist accusation on these lines, in a statement before the **Security** Council on 25th August 1950 the American representative in the United Nations, Ernest Gross, reversed his country's policy.

* At the outset, I congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on the introduction of this Bill.

* I hope that the Minister for Social **Security**, who comes from Ipswich and who is a little isolated from this, might listen to what I have to say.

* I should have thought it to be in the interests of the whole cattle industry that the Cattlemen's Union, with its undoubted energies, abilities and funds, be directed to closer collaboration and co-operation with the other industry organisations and the Government to secure a return to economic stability and **security** for all sections of the cattle industry.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Records are not maintained to show the breakdown by electoral divisions of expenditure under major programs of the Department of Social **Security**.

* No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national **security** or public safety, public order ... the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

* The matters of medical, hospital and nursing home benefits are under consideration by the Minister for Social **Security** to whom this question should therefore properly be directed.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
) and (2) It has been the long standing practice of Australian Governments, regardless of their political complexion, not to enter into discussion on specific matters affecting intelligence and **security**.

* Even though we are spending $ 12m to $ 1 5m a year in this country on **security** measures such as bank cameras, armoured cars, payroll guards and tellers' cages - I am not including the cost of maintaining our police forces in this figure- commercial and private **security** is still careless enough for the professional criminal to make his hit and run successfully.

* I do not wish to speak at any length on the amendment to clause 8 of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill as I have had an earlier opportunity to make my argument in relation to it.

* Firstly, why is the Government not prepared to give the Minister a general right of access to Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation information, subject to the exclusions already set out in clause 8; that is, subject to all those exclusions that have already been passed under clause 8?

* If there is speculation as to which was the correct version in the newspapers of the telex message from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, will the Prime Minister table the telex message?

* T ask the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  whether he can clearly indicate that these moneys were not spent on the taking of photographs, for **security** purposes, of persons within Australia which activity should come under another heading.

* If the money was used for these purposes I believe this amount should be credited against the Attorney-General's Department, which is the Department in charge of **security**, and the House should be clearly informed on exactly how the money is spent.

* Departments which do not have a **security** responsibility should not be used for that purpose.

* Japanese workers do not see new technology as a threat to their livelihood for the simple reason that they know that, short of murdering the general manager, they have **security** of employment until they retire.

* Because of better industrial relations, wages, conditions, **security** of employment and so on, Japanese workers stay with the company.

* The Japanese culture and traditional relations between employer and employee may be vastly different from Australia's but if one examines the specific features of Japanese industrial relations- consultations, **security** of employment, good wages and conditions- and the Japanese solutions to problems, one can realise that Japanese workers have reacted favourably to being treated as human beings, not just as factory fodder.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
There is no doubt about the validity of the holding of Aboriginal land.

* I think it comes as a bit of shock to honourable gentlemen opposite that it has been possible to approach this" matter conceptually in such an idealistic way, to give effect to Aboriginal traditions in such an effective way, and also to provide for the title that will ensure that Aboriginal" people can occupy that land with a genuine sense of **security**.

* A proliferation of nuclear facilities without adequate protection against diversion of material to nuclear weapons production or nuclear explosives would pose serious threats to international stability and peace, obviously inimical to Australia's interests and to global and regional **security**.

* The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; the application of effective International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to re-export, enrichment and reprocessing; physical **security**; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards.

* Ninth, the Government would require in future bilateral agreements the assurance from uranium importing countries that adequate physical **security** will be maintained on their nuclear industries.

* In addition, we believe the agreements should specify compliance with standards of physical **security** based, at a minimum, on International Atomic Energy Agency recommendations as presently defined and as updated from time to time.

* They should also make provision for expert level consultations as necessary on physical **security** arrangements.

* Those files would be cleared on top **security** only and would be passed by hand - they are not things which are put in the post and which one hopes for the best will arrive.

* There are many people serving in departments the Minister knows this only too well and it is not a reflection upon those people, it is just a fact of life who are not cleared to top **security**.

* Slates House of Representatives sub-committee on National **Security** Policy and Scientific Development in July 1971, to the effect that as of 20th July the Russian presence in the Indian Ocean consisted of four ships comprising one destroyer, one LST and two Fleet Minesweepers?

* As stated in my answer to that question, to reveal the establishment level of Commonwealth Police at each Australian airport could jeopardise airport **security** and compromise the high standard of protection that is presently afforded the travelling public and airport staff.

* 1427  (Hansard,  4 April 1979, page 1349) revealed the number of Commonwealth Police at Sydney airport but did not specify the numbers on duty at either the domestic or international terminals, thus maintaining the integrity of airport **security**.

* For example, these ordinances include: An ordinance providing for the interpretation of Territory ordinances and statutory instruments: a juries ordinance providing for all aspects of jury service and, in particular, for women to serve on juries; an ordinance making comprehensive provision with respect to maintenance of wives, husbands and children; a new Wills Ordinance; ordinances enabling married persons to sue each other in tort; a number of amendments to the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance; an ordinance facilitating the transfer of marketable securities; a new Family Provision Ordinance - to ensure that the family of a deceased person receive adequate provision out of his estate; an ordinance enabling a person between the ages of 18 and 21 years to borrow on the **security** of a mortgage of his home; amendments to the Administration and Probate Ordinance; and amendments to the Real Property Ordinance.

* We have at least four sources of data concerning the unemployed, namely, the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, certain surveys undertaken by the Department of Social **Security** and that information provided by independent surveys, notably certain consultants within the Australian economy.

* To my knowledge the Commonwealth **security** forces have not even interviewed people or made inquiries about the attacks on the honourable member for Lalor and Councillor Gietzelt.

* I would like to know what is wrong with the Attorney-General and the Commonwealth **security** police.

* Recently in a court in New South Wales which I attended the magistrate said: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I ) (a) The Department of Social **Security** made capital grants for the construction of aged or disabled persons homes in New South Wales and Australia in each year since 1972-73 as follows: 
The honourable gentleman referred to me as the Acting Minister for Health.

* He is performing a public service because members  of  the Opposition, and particularly front bench members of the Opposition, have repeatedly attempted to lure( the public into a sense of false **security** by claiming over and over again that the Constitution would prevent the nationalisation of health services.

* I have written about this matter to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on several occasions and in her last reply to me she advised that my views had been forwarded to the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped, which was considering the position in toto.

* 539)  Mr Connolly  asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Department of Labor and Immigration Department of Social **Security** Department of Foreign Affairs Department of Education Department of Police and Customs Department of the Media Department of Housing and Construction Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet 
**Security**, upon notice: 
A censure motion is the most serious measure open to an Opposition to emphasise its concern with Government policy.

* It is a secure, if cowardly, tactic and today we saw a further demonstration of that **security** by the cowardly tactic in the Prime Minister's leaving the House, with all of his Ministers, and ensuring that most of the back benchers of the Government would be empty in the course of this debate.

* In turning to the Governor-General's Speech I wish to express my satisfaction that due emphasis has been placed on the important matters of defence and **security**, our role in South East Asia and our concern to assist the people of Papua and New Guinea along the road to economic stability and nationhood.

* The first and foremost responsibility of the Australian Government is to ensure the **security** of our people.

* No doubt he spoke with great eloquence and sincerity, but the thought ran through my mind, as he gave statistics, whether, if a question were asked of the various people who admit to being victims of abortion, they would have carried the child had there been an adequate family income, had there been a suitable home, and had there been some sense of social **security**.

* If and when we get adequate child endowment payments and a just wage and **security** for every worker, I think we will be entitled to have a look at the matters raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong.

* Why should our intelligence organisation look at activities which in this clause relate to our defence forces carrying out their functions as defence forces for the purposes of the **security** and defence of the Commonwealth?

* We have to look at all its elements because in addition to establishing that the activities are directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance of the defence forces in carrying out their activities, it must also be established that the functions of the defence forces in that instance are for the purpose of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth.

* This is not an exercise but it is something that is involved directly in the **security** and the defence of the Commonwealth.

* We welcomed these talks, provided of course, that any agreement reached was balanced between the two super powers and was consistent with the **security** interests of ANZUS.

* The Joint Chiefs of Staff are the principal military advisors to the  President,  the National **Security** Council, and the Secretary of Defense.

* I only hope that we have some sort of national **security** council or watchdog.

* Let us have in time of peace a defence force where there is not competition, where there is not diversity of purpose but where there is a single goal, one that is aiming for something that can be achieved in time of war- **security** for this nation.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Spectacles are not generally available from the Department of Social **Security** in the way that some pensioner concessions are available.

* Australians should never forget that this Government, which said that our **security** and future independence was challenged by the menace from the north - and Vietnam was cited as an example - saw fit to call up only a section of the 20-year olds of this country and place on them the full responsibility for the defence of this nation.

* Yes, I recall the question asked of the Minister for Social **Security** yesterday by the honourable member for Macquarie about hardship that can occur to people who are in an unequal bargaining position when .they come to negotiate with the managements of certain homes that provide facilities for old people.

* The same situation applies in the matter that was touched on by the honourable member for Macquarie and the Minister for Social **Security** at question time yesterday.

* They are placing a heavy additional burden upon the community, both in terms of cost of their hospitalisation and of their after care, and upon the social **security** system.

* The allocation for spending by the Department of Social **Security**, on the other hand, dropped and the funds formerly disbursed by the Legislative Assembly have dwindled to nothing since the Minister's piracy of the poker machine funds for the Department of the Capital Territory.

* There are people who require social **security** handouts, who of right ought to have them.

* The Department of Social **Security** contributed $ 1.32m and the revenue from poker machine funds added close to $ 1 m. Total welfare funds for the Australian Capital Territory were therefore $8.25m.

* Another worry about this clause is that the second reading speech introduced in this chamber by the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  does not explain- there is no effort to justify- why this group of beneficiaries alone, amongst all the social **security** beneficiaries, is to be denied even the benefit of annual indexation.

* Of all the various categories of social **security** beneficiaries, why is this group alone to be left out?

* It will be good in the long run for all these people ', but to deny the victims of its own economic policy an indexation award granted to every other social **security** beneficiary it is, to my mind, a monumental hypocrisy in that these victims should now be selected out from all other social **security** beneficiaries and denied indexation- the one group denied this privilege across the whole range of social **security** beneficiaries.

* I say quite frankly to members on the opposite side that if they now vote for this provision and then come along a few weeks later to prate their concern about the unemployed, they will deserve to be treated-I believe the 
There is evidence to show that on 10 November 1975, the day before the GovernorGeneral dismissed the Whitlam Government, a cable was sent from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation liaison officer in Washington to the Director-General of ASIO in Canberra conveying a message from the head of the East- Asia Division of the CIA, a  Mr Shackley.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 20 September 1979: 
A considerable part of the Bill deals with public inquiries into matters of environmental concern.

* Exemption from comment will occur only in Isolated cases such as where publication of the impact statement could lead to land speculation or endanger national **security**.

* 1 ) Australia Post does provide various agency services for Commonwealth Government Departments and Authorities, including, for example, Telecom Australia, the Commonwealth Savings Bank Departments of Social **Security** and Veterans' Affairs, the Australian Electoral Office and the Australian Taxation Office.

* He immediately rang the **security** officer who was sitting in an office.

* The **security** officer could see the fire from where he was sitting.

* The reason given for the **security** officer not having seen- the fire previously was that there was a bright desk lamp in front of him.

* The **security** officer was immediately advised of it by telephone.

* So both the weighbridge attendant and the **security** officer were aware of the fire at 9.35 p.m. To me, the sensible and logical thing for them to do was ring the shipyard watchman and advise him that there was a fire.

* They then collected the head **security** officer and went around by vehicle to the shipyard gate.

* page 14 of the report it is stated:  the Weighbridge Attendant, the Blast Furnace **Security** Officer .

* picked up the **Security** Officer, drove to a **Security** Store to pick up some fire fighting equipment, then drove to the Shipyard Main Gate where they were let into the Shipyard by the Main Gate Watchman at aproximately 9.50 p.m.

* The **security** staff' in the shipyard could have been trying to do something in that 15 minutes to put the fire out, but they were not, because they had not been advised.

* How does inadequacy of care, love, guidance, training and sense of **security** affect a growing child?

* His own **security** agents had found a listening device hidden in the air-conditioning unit in his hotel room in Canberra.

* The air-conditioning unit had not been functioning properly, and his **security** agents bad become suspicious and had looked into it, and had found the electronic 'ear'.

* The sick, widows, including working widows, the infirm, invalids, children, public servants and people in almost every sector of the nation will be given new hope and **security**.

* I understand that the offices are shared with some Arab companies and that **security** is very tight.

* It is almost impossible to walk through the front door of the building without a **security** clearance to get into a lift to go up to the fourth floor to speak to the staff of the Australian Tourist Commission.

* At the same time he can call in a competent architect to design him a new modern house built on sound foundations in which he will be able to live in safety and **security**.

* The reason he said that was to lull everyone in Australia into a false sense of **security** and into believing that the present  Deputy  Prime Minister shares the same capacity for negotiation and the same policy as the former Minister for Minerals and Energy, the honourable member for Cunningham.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
How many Social **Security** Appeals Tribunals are there.

* By our economic policies we are determined to remove the fear of unemployment; our social **security** program is designed to remove as far as humanly possible the fear of poverty and sickness; our foreign policies are aimed at reducing the fears and suspicions which have so hobbled Australian thinking and distorted Australian attitudes for generations.

* Accordingly I instructed the Attorney-General to take all measures he deemed necessary to guarantee the **security** and success of the visit.

* Under such a heavy responsibility I believe he was entitled to take the actions he did to ensure that he had the full co-operation of Australia'a law enforcement and **security** organisations.

* On this occasion there was complete co-operation between ASIO and the Commonwealth Police, between ASIO and my Department of 
I ask the Minister for Social **Security** whether he has seen the pamphlet being circulated by the honourable member for Boothby and the advertisements appearing in his name which seek to implant a belief that our promise of free hospital care in standard wards of public hospitals is false and that this type of care would cost, according to one advertisement, $49 a week and according to the other $119 a week.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Under the States Grants (Home Care) Act, funds are provided to State Governments to assist towards housekeeping services for the aged, senior citizens' centres and the salaries of welfare officers employed in association with senior citizens' centres.

* 1 976-77 is the first year of a three program for Senior Citizens' Centres announced by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech and the Department of Social **Security** will be conferring with State Government authorities to prepare priority lists for funding purposes.

* Social **security** payments will be increased by 8.2 per cent from the first pay period in May.

* On what basis can it say that whilst it is prepared to pay social **security** recipients an 8.2 per cent increase in benefits it is prepared to go into the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and argue that that increase should not be spread across the work force in general?

* Of course Japan was the broker and the agent for Indonesia in the debate in the **Security** Council.

* It fought very hard to have a soft resolution put through the **Security** Council.

* Nursing homes can raise their fees only if the increase is approved by the Department of Social **Security**.

* I challenge the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to deny that that is so.

* The overall position too is one with which Japan is vitally concerned in maintaining **security** of supplies of coal and iron ore from Australia.

* Well, that is true; but I hope that where necessary we will be able to do a great deal more than provide equipments and skills, because these operations might be vital to our **security** and our survival.

* This is an area which the defence White Paper does not explore, perhaps for **security** reasons; but I think it is one that we should keep in mind.

* I do not know what the legal position is, whether ponce or people working for the Commonwealth Department of Social **Security** have the legal right to do such a thing, but I assume that they have- otherwise they would not have produced the recording in evidence.

* I can just imagine the screams, and I think the justified screams, from the legal profession or from politicians if this were done for the purpose of obtaining evidence in the offices of legal practitioners or of politicians 
In relation to the present court proceedings against those people who are alleged to have defrauded the Department of Social **Security**, I consider that is a sub judice matter and I do not intend to make any comment.

* The fact is that it gives a great deal of **security** to persons affected by this clause if there are no provisos which can possibly exclude them.

* The incident- assuming that the information I have received today is correct, and I have no reason whatever to doubt its authenticity- is the latest development in what can only be described as a steadily deteriorating state of affairs affecting the safety and **security** of Australia.

* I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to take strong steps to deal with the industrial lawlessness which is weakening and undermining the safety and **security** of millions of decent, law-abiding Australians.

* Let us consider the social **security** area and the nursing home benefit.

* When the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  announced in the House last week that new increased rates were to come into effect on 1 August, the Government was subsidising nursing homes to the extent of $67.90 per bed per week.

* true, that is that they are left with $4 a week of their pension to spend - are having to meet a shortfall of $13.60 a week to maintain the charging rates set out and standardised by the Department of Social **Security**, not by the nursing homes.

* But the private nursing home, the one operated by the individual on the basis of charges laid down by the Department of Social **Security** - and you can bet your life that they are not over-profitable charges - cannot afford to subsidise these people and can take only people who can afford to pay.

* We have a situation where the Minister for Social **Security** and this Government are prepared to offer a $2 for $1 grant up to $9,000.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has stated that he must wait for his Party to make a decision on whether he will be able to lift these ceiling limits.

* Can the Prime Minister throw light on published reports that foreign governments have expressed their concern about **security** in Australia?

* Much of the criticism is based on misinformation and given that Australia is an island continent distant from most of its major markets and suppliers the criticism is short sighted and against the national interest in terms of long term economic **security** and defence needs.

* At the same time there is little opportunity for new personnel to enter the shipping industry despite the fact that in the same 10 years there has been an increase of 15 per cent in the numbers employed due mainly to improved leave conditions since 1 964. 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 15 March 1977: 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 21 September 1978: 
It is proper that Australia has brought its expertise to ICAO and that it maintains a continuing interest in such a prestigious organisation.

* There is an awful lot of responsibility  attaching to that  organisation to ensure that international travellers can move about with a reasonable assurance as to their **security**, well being and comfort.

* Specifically it covers technical problems, supersonic operations, all-weather operations, aircraft accident prevention, as I have just mentioned, the application of space techniques relating to aviation, visual aids, the air-worthiness of aircraft, automated data interchange systems, aircraft infrastructure compatibility, the impact of civil aviation development on the human environment and aviation **security**.

* I would have thought that the principal role of the Minister of Labour and National Service and the Government would be to safeguard the **security** of every wage and salary earner.

* But if that is not enough, men are out of work and job **security** is under threat.

* We have had a series of strange circumstances since the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  took it upon himself to raid the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters in both Canberra and Melbourne.

* This may appear to be irrelevant to the motion before the Chair but it is not because the more we ask questions related to this unusual set of circumstances, circumstances which are most strange, the more we find diversive tactics being used to try to take public attention away from this breach of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act which has been committed by this Government.

* First of all I want to make it clear that I will not enter into any debate about the relative merits of the former Director-General of the Department of Social Services as it then was,  Mr Hamilton,  and the present Director-General of the Department of Social **Security** as it is now called,  Dr Wienholt,  except to say that the reputation of  Mr Hamilton  is extremely high with all those people who worked with him, and it is unfortunate that through ill health he found it necessary to retire.

* The honourable member for Mackellar stressed the outstanding qualities of excellence needed by a Director-General of the Department of Social **Security** and he referred to  Mr Hamilton.

* It is dealing with the definition of subversion, which is one of the operative words in defining **security**.

* **Security** is relevant because it is the basis upon which the Organisation is given a precise capacity to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence, that is, to obtain information.

* The fact of the matter is that there are quite specific examples - 
1 ) to (3) It has been the policy and practice of all Governments since 1949 that details of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization or its operations are not disclosed.

* After much patience and persistence I rise to draw to the attention of the Government some anomalies which I believe exist within the Department of Social **Security**.

* I hope that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will act to correct them.

* These are the issues specifically raised by the honourable member for Wannon: The authority of the Government over the armed forces; the morale and effectiveness of those forces; the role of the Army in Vietnam and the **security** of the forces remaining in Vietnam.

* Last September the present Prime Minister went so far as to discipline his official spokesman on social **security**, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  for daring to suggest publicly that Medibank would be scrapped if the Liberals came to power.

* Whatever problems have occurred in the past, although there was some ambiguity, I think it was the better and more correct view that the **security** organisation was answerable to the Attorney-General.

* My question, which I address to the Minister for Social **Security**, refers to the national health scheme.

* The Government regards this as its prime problemrestoring business confidence, restoring job opportunities, increasing the job **security** of those who are lucky enough to have a job at the moment.

* Faced with a choice between supporting application of the full 6.4 per cent or presenting a case whir h argued the cause of job **security** and job opportunity, the Government took the latter course.

* The third reason is the question of **security** which has been raised in this House on a number of occasions.

* It is well known that there have been problems of **security** in relation to armouries located at Australian schools for the cadet corps.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What provisions exist for a private citizen or public servant to obtain redress from illegal **security** service activities or harassment.

* 253 of 1968 of the United Nations **Security** Council.

* It abides by the United Nations **Security** Council resolution.

* The 2 members designated by the Opposition to speak on health and social **security**, the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd),  and the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  have decided that the usual parliamentary break is not long enough and have decided to stay away for another two or three weeks.

* Consequently, the Bill before us reflects his inability to cope with the sort of long term guarantees of **security** that the wheat farmer needs.

* It is that absence of long term **security** that I regard as the most regrettable feature of this present legislation.

* In spite of employment opportunities created by decentralisation; in spite of the improved facilities that an increased population attracts to country areas; and in spite of the increased **security** that is created in areas through diversification, decentralisation will be obstructed by honourable members whose political existence depends upon the absence of people in other than rural industries because they will support the Labor or Liberal Parties.

* The first of these is to provide for the transfer of administration of certain parts of the Act from the Department of Health to the Department of Social **Security**.

* Provisions in the Bill give effect to the transfer of Parts III to VI of the Act, and other parts relating to matters arising in connection with these Parts, to the Department of Social **Security**.

* Quite often it is a worthless **security** which they have.

* If the financial institutions are not prepared to lend on this sort of **security** we must question the morality and the responsibility of using government funds to perpetuate the situation.

* They will have a confused state of mind, no **security**, a sense of not being wanted and in many instances they will turn to crime and to drugs.

* They want jobs and they want **security**.

* to (4) In accordance with established practice from which departures are made only in exceptional circumstances (which in my judgment do not exist here) I do not propose to answer questions about the operations or alleged operations of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The Department of Social **Security** has advised that expenditure on the payment of unemployment benefits in each month of 1 976-77 has been as follows: 
Under the heading of social **security**, one sees that a grant to organisations under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act has been cut almost by half- from $5.6m to $2.9m.

* So on the one hand we have cutbacks of over $2m in the social **security** area under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act and on the other there is an increase of $2m in the payments to the Fraser Island companies.

* It would be interesting to have before us the number of residents of Norfolk Island who receive Australian social **security** benefits, repatriation benefits, and such like.

* What we are discussing is not whether the island is to be more closely integrated into or to become a more remote part of the Australian scene, but how we can preserve the rights of the people of Norfolk Island, the environment of Norfolk Island and the **security** of Norfolk Island and still retain it as part of the Australian scene with the advantages which that bestows.

* There are also the matters of social **security**, education and health.

* I think it is unduly mean to consider social **security** as being available only to people who happen to be inside Australia's taxation system.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  soon illustrated that this money had not been made available because the State Government had not proceeded with its plans, in those 7 years since it had first talked about this hospital, to the stage at which construction could be commenced.

* In a Press statement released on 6 September 1973 the Minister for Social **Security** said: 
Did he and the Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Social **Security** have discussions before 28 May 1976 on the problems of Aboriginal employment, including the impact of unemployment benefits payments on Aboriginal communities.

* Were officers of his Department and the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs, Social **Security** and Education appointed on 28 May 1976 to a working party to make a full study of these matters.

* It has been mentioned by various speakers on this side of the chamber that one of the greatest achievements in the social **security** field has been the introduction of the family allowances scheme.

* The social **security** and welfare provisions in the Budget follow the major restructuring and improvement of the family allowances scheme.

* Social **Security** figures show that annual prosecutions for dole' offences have never amounted to more than half of one per cent of all claimants.

* Despite erratic and inadequate notification of rights to claimants, coupled with an appeals body that lacks independence and may have its decisions reversed by the Director-General of Social **Security**, more than 50 per cent of those unemployment beneficiaries who appeal against termination of benefit are found to have been unjustly penalised.

* Secondly, it would mean that they may or may not be brought under the social **security** umbrella of Australia.

* The people have their own social **security** system.

* However, when these people are challenged to provide the necessary detail for a social **security** investigation, they usually run for cover for one or two reasons.

* We cannot afford, on a costbenefit basis, to have a sufficient number of social **security** investigatory officers to check out everything.

* The first two relate to section 107C of the Social **Security** Act which the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  announced in March was under review.

* Has there been any further defence contribution which would in any way at all contribute to the **security** of this country, to the protection of our northern frontiers?

* If the Government has not abandoned the defence and **security** of this country the least it should do would be to build up the Army to divisional strength.

* When I was interrupted last evening I was making the point that we on this side of the House would have appreciated it very much if the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  had extended the Commonwealth subsidy to such local and charitable organisations as the Apex Clubs and kindred associations, if they were interested in erecting senior citizens' buildings.

* I hope that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  can have meaningful consultations with the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  in order to encourage the universities to increase their intake of people interested in pursuing the course for prospective social workers.

* For the information of honourable members, I present the unclassified version of the report of the Protective **Security** Review.

* Honourable members will recall that, following the bombing at the Sydney Hilton Hotel in February last year,  Mr Justice  Hope of the New South Wales Supreme Court was appointed to conduct a review of the whole area of protective **security** in Australia.

* I record the Government's appreciation of the valuable contribution that  Mr Justice  Hope 's review has made to our consideration of the important field of protective **security**.

* The report, parts of which are classified, looks at counter-terrorist machinery in Australia and the considerations relevant to the effective relationships between law enforcement and intelligence authorities at both the Commonwealth and State levels, the arrangements and procedures for handling terrorist incidents, the protection of VIPs, the use of the Defence Force in civilian **security** situations, and protective and **security** arrangements in Commonwealth departments and authorities.

* The report will provide a basis on which the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory governments will be able to work together better in matters of protective **security** and counter-terrorism.

* Mr Justice  Hope also stated the view, which we endorse, that as much of the material in the report be published as is possible without endangering **security** or the public interest.

* In this respect it will be recalled that the Government followed  Mr Justice  Hope's recommendations regarding publication of the reports of his Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** in 1 977.

* For the information of honourable members I table the unclassified version of the report of the Protective **Security** Review.

* One of the central themes that flows from the report is the need for greater co-operation between the authorities involved in protective **security**.

* Honourable members will note the report's proposals for legislative changes dealing with the use of the Defence Force in aid of civilian **security** raise very significant constitutional, legal, civil rights and practical issues.

* It also provides a most valuable opportunity, which this Government will not let pass, to establish and maintain effective relationships with the State and Northern Territory governments in the field of protective **security**.

* That sort of industrial action was specifically outlawed as far as the Social **Security** Act was concerned.

* That was an extension of the earlier principle but it had the same effect as this amending legislation has to the Social **Security** Act.

* Unless she can go before an officer of the Department of Social **Security** who is quite likely to be a young male- and I say 'quite likely' because that is a SO per cent chance with an assessment officer- and proves that the conditions under which she was employed were intolerable to her personally- and, I would suggest, it is not unusual; that it does happen that girls are taken advantage of- she has to take the choice of whether she will put up with the indignities of maintaining her employment under those circumstances or suffer the further and doubtful indignities of trying to prove to an officer in an abstract situation that she has been treated in a way which probably would have criminal implications if it could be proved in court.

* If the Government wants to make that point it should advise us of the sizes of comparable pensions in those countries related, say, to the normal social **security** pension.

* We currently depend for our **security** on servicemen.

* What is (a) the total office size, (b) the rental cost for (i) the year 1977-78 and (ii) the period 1 July 1978 to date, (c) the administrative costs, and (d) the number of staff temporary and permanent, in occupation of the following Commonwealth offices within the Electoral Division of Parramatta: (A) the Acoustic Laboratory of the Department of Health, 68 Macquarie Street, (B) the Australian Electoral Office, 28 George Street, (C) the Commonwealth Employment Service, 30 Darcy Street, (D) the Bureau of Customs, 30 Darcy Street, (E) the Family Court of Australia, (F) the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, 23 George Street, (G) Medibank, S3 Phillip Street, (H) Medibank, Church Street, (I) Qantas, 20 Macquarie Street, (J) the Department of Social **Security**, 68 Macquarie Street, (K) the Department of Social **Security**, Level 6, Westfield Centre, (L) Telecom Australia,5th Floor, 30 Darcy Street and (M) the Taxation Office, 126 Church Street.

* I obtained a reply from the Minister for Social **Security** which I think is important to him and to those concerned.

* The Minister for Social **Security** remains the legal guardian of the children concerned in the cases in South Australia and will remain so until such time as they are legally adopted in accordance with State law, marry, leave the country or reach the age of 18 years.

* The situation is that the health benefits, nursing home benefits and the social **security** benefits which have been paid have been constantly decried.

* It will be able to negotiate contracts abroad, secure in the knowledge that, with the Minister behind it, it will not be prevented from honouring them by the imposition of export controls: no private miner has this **security**.

* This nation's continued growth, **security** and prosperity in no small measure will be dependent upon our capacity to retain control and ownership of our land and our vast, rich non-renewable resources, particularly those fuels on which we and every other country rely to meet energy needs.

* The Attorney-General may, under clause 9, give the Ombudsman a certificate that disclosure to the Ombudsman of certain information would be contrary to the public interest, by reason of prejudice to **security** or defence, or to CommonwealthState relations, or of disclosure of deliberations of Cabinet or of the Northern Territory Executive Council.

* Clause 1 4 of the Bill also provides that his access to premises may be restricted where this would prejudice national **security** or defence.

* The Ombudsman and the deputies are given **security** of tenure in office akin to that accorded to judges, so that there is little likelihood of an ombudsman's independence of operation being influenced by the executive Government.

* In certain circumstances a second mortgage can be obtained from a bank provided that the bank lends the money as a personal loan and the home is not used as **security** because power of sale cannot be exercised against a war service homes title in the event of default unless this loan has been approved by the Director.

* There is no doubt that this could be done and these people would be able to get this money because if **security** were given by the Government with the HLIC insuring a loan to make sure that the repayments were made then there would be no chance of default in repayment of the second mortgage and there would be no difficulty whatsoever in getting the money which a soldier may need to bridge the deposit gap.

* I seriously suggest that this is something which might be looked intoI know that perhaps in certain circumstances the Director of War Service Homes may be sympathetic in permitting a second mortgage but I have known of a lot of cases in which this has become a problem because of the nature of the **security** required for a second mortgage.

* If it were not second loans could interfere with the proper administration of the scheme.I hope that the Minister will take some notice of what I have suggested in relation to the bridging of the deposit gap for ex-servicemen by attaching a special condition or by permitting the HLIC to provide proper **security** for an ex-serviceman who needs a second mortgage.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Comprehensive Reciprocal Agreements on social **security** exist between Australia and New Zealand and between Australia and the United Kingdom.

* I refer to those people in  receipt of  social  **security** and welfare  benefits.

* Under the previous Government - and I take the figures from Hansard of 21 August 1973 - the amount actually spent on social **security** and welfare benefits rose by $503.5m over the amount provided in the previous year whereas the estimated increase this year over the amount provided last year is only $339.5m - a very serious drop of some $64m or 33 per cent less than the increase provided last year over the preceding year.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 23 August 1978: 
-My question to the Prime Minister relates to the Hilton bombing outrage.

* Will the Prime Minister inform the House on what advice the Government decided to select licensed premises in the heart of the city of Sydney as being the best **security** area in which to hold a regional conference?

* The Commission may give **security** over the whole or any part of its assets for the repayment of amounts borrowed under this section and the payment of interest on amounts so borrowed.

* For that reason, draconian **security** measures were introduced.

* The Bill was brought down at a time when there had been espionage scandals in the Northern Hemisphere- hence these repressive **security** provisions.

* an independent regulatory authority responsible for nuclear-related environmental protection, health, safety, **security**, safeguards and other non-proliferation activities: 
The Atomic Energy Act is an inappropriate vehicle for the commercial mining of uranium, or for any commercial mining, because under that Act any project can be declared a defence project.

* There can be a denial of civil liberties and these repressive Draconian **security** provisions can come into play in normal commercial mining.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Honourable members will recall that one of the basic principles of the scheme was the concept that lack of capital was not to debar an otherwise eligible ex-serviceman from participating in war service land settlement.

* The authorities for their part accepted a charge over the assets concerned as **security** for the money advanced.

* Since they are generally not in a position to offer acceptable **security** to banks, stock firms or other lending institutions, they still need to have recourse to credit from within the scheme.

* In reading through the estimates, I And that in 1977-78 we provided $9,950,000 for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, our own home-grown keystone cops organisation.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What is the advertising budget of the Department of Social **Security** for 1975-76.

* This Budget gives great emphasis to the areas of education, health, social **security** and welfare, housing and community amenities, culture and recreation, Aboriginal advancement, sport, tourism, aid for States, transport and communications.

* The great bulk of this Government's spending in this Budget in relation to the public sector is related to education, social **security** and housing.

* Surely the honourable member will concede that these are absolutely priorities, as he has conceded already in relation to social **security**.

* Among the members of the United Nations, regarding the position in Rhodesia, we are one of the most scrupulous in our observance of the **Security** Council resolutions imposing sanctions on that country.

* We are one of the few members of the United Nations which has been scrupulous in its observance of the **Security** Council resolutions.

* There are exemptions possible on humanitarian grounds for the supply of food, for example, and it is true that we have sent wheat under that exemption which appears in the **Security** Council resolution itself.

* Did he and the Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Social **Security** have discussions before 28 May 1976 on the problems of Aboriginal employment, including the impact of unemployment benefits payments on Aboriginal communities.

* Were officers of his Department and the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs, Social **Security** and Education appointed on 28 May 1976 to a working party to make a full study of these matters.

* If Labor had not come to power in 1972, it is possible that the number of Aborigines registered as unemployed would still be under 4000 while untold thousands of Aborigines would have continued to be denied assistance in gaining employment and income **security**.

* If a person is to break out of the poverty situation into which he was born, he must be able to achieve economic **security**, which implies permanent employment .

* - Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence and the indulgence of the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  to raise a point of procedure in relation to the White Paper on the Australian Health Insurance Program tabled by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  a moment or two ago.

* Will the Minister for Social **Security** or the Leader of the House give me an assurance that there will be a debate on this White Paper by members of the Parliament of all political persuasions within the next week or two?

* But of course the reality is that this has been costed by the Department of Social **Security**.

* It does not mean that our scheme will require increased public service administration because the technique of collection can be wedded into our present collection schemes - the taxation system and the Department of Social **Security** which already handles much more money in the way of payments to pensioners and so on every week than health funds do, anyway.

* As the honourable member for Sturt has said, really it all boils down to what gives best **security** to the children.

* A glance at Schedule 2 on page 3 reveals that the expenditure in the Department is the third largest of all the departments, only the Department of Defence and the Department of Social **Security** claiming a greater share.

* She is a person who has obtained the highest **security** clearance that it is possible for anyone to obtain.

* She has been cleared by **security** to perform the kind of task to which I have appointed her.

* In view of what I have said, this means that her financial propriety has been cleared by **security**.

* I take it that what the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, said was true and unless it is proved to the contrary I believe that the House must accept his word as true: 
She is a person who has obtained the highest **security** clearance that it is possible for anyone to obtain.

* She has been cleared by **security** to perform the kind of task to which I have appointed her.

* I find that **security** did not contact her critics.

* In other words, **security** did not do in this matter the kind of things which **security** normally does.

* If she obtained that kind of clearance it could only have been obtained through the manipulation of **security**.

* Here we have a position where in view of what was on Government files, in view of what had been done in the past and was known in the past, nevertheless a **security** clearance on the highest level was given, to use the Treasurer's words, 'to perform the kind of task to which I have appointed her', namely, a sensitive financial task.

* It is utterly impossible that **security**, if it had not been manipulated and if it had carried out its normal routine checks for this kind of thing, could have given that kind of clearance.

* It is obvious, as I have said, that if the normal checks had been made, if **security** had done the normal thing and if **security** had even looked at Government files it would have found that there was evidence- not perhaps of criminal activities, although I do not say yes or no to that- of things which would have prevented **security** giving a **security** clearance on the highest level for this kind of financial task which she was to perform for the Treasurer.

* Who manipulated **security**?

* Apart from what the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  may or may not do in this matter, the time has now come for **security**- this reported **security**- to be called into question.

* Today in another place  Senator Greenwood  brought evidence of the manipulation of **security** by this Government for quite improper purposes.

* He was speaking of the manipulation of **security** in the communist interest.

* It is an appalling thing if we have a government one of whose Ministers is capable of manipulating **security** and preventing a proper report being put forward.

* The working party has a membership of nine and is constituted by six senior officers of the Department of Health (including the  chairman),  two of the Department of Social **Security** and one of the Repatriation and Compensation Department.

* Of course, we have heard from members of the old team which demonstrates about everything that might lead to the financial **security** and the general **security** of this country.

* Until classification became a national operation it was not possible to look at a reasonable and stable marketing scheme which would bring long-term **security** to the beef cattle industry.

* 1 ) The Commonwealth Employment Service informs the Department of Social **Security** when a claimant for or recipient of Unemployment Benefit refuses an offer of suitable employment.

* We see them kill 50 000 to 60 000 defenceless women and children just because they did not agree with their philosophy and they claimed that it was a threat to their **security**.

* How could 500 000 half-starved people be a threat to the **security** of Indonesia with its 120 million people?

* If there is not stabilisation, the problems of primary industry are such that without ordinary social **security** benefits that do not apply, there must, in justice, be some sort of negative income tax applied to farmers.

* The Department insists that any retrenchments of facilities at airfields should not intrude on operational **security** and in no way represent an intimidatory step to bring to heel local government authorities which may have adopted a stance of non-co-operation with the Department's ambitions or which, for reasons validly based, are not inclined to take over ownership of their local airfield.

* Also the Department of Social **Security** carried out an examination of the efficiency of the various methods and procedures adopted internally in the Department.

* As I am advised, over the course of the last year the staff ceilings for the Department of Social **Security** have increased by 8 per cent or 850 personnel, despite the fact that overall staff ceilings through the Public Service have been reduced by about 2 per cent.

* It deals with the taxation of certain social **security** payments.

* In 1976-77 and subsequent income years it is proposed that particular social **security** benefits be included in assessable income and thus made subject to income tax.

* So we have to be self reliant and we must have national independence and ensure that we have **security**, that we have collective **security** with other friendly nations in the area.

* Schools will have to bear the responsibility for the administration of their units, the care of uniforms and equipment, and they will have to pay the very high expenses incurred in providing for the **security** of armaments.

* What strict **security** requirements, at great cost, will be imposed on the schools?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
In speaking of the role played by the Australian Army in Vietnam I must pay special tribute to the part played by our national servicemen and also by the CMF.

* Nevertheless it is important to recall that national service was not introduced because of Vietnam but because in 1964 the Government assessed that it was not possible to obtain by voluntary means the army strength needed for our **security**.

* It has been the policy and practice of successive Governments since Prime Minister Chifley not to disclose matters relating to **security** intelligence.

* The important thing that I want to stress is that in that country was a government which traditionally relied upon the Western side for its **security** and its protection.

* But with a change of government and with a change of the world situation in this region the Malaysian Government's view of its own **security** and how it can rely upon neighbours and the great  powers  has changed.

* I should not like to see anything happen which will reduce the job **security** of those people already employed in the industry.

* I should like to see an authority similar to the Stevedoring Industry Authority established in the building industry which would provide job **security** for all building workers.

* Honourable members will, of course, understand that where there is a threat to international peace the matter comes within the jurisdiction of the **Security** Council.

* There has, however, been a previous occasion when a resolution, known as the Uniting for Peace Resolution, was passed in the General Assembly at a time when the **Security** Council found that it was ineffectual where there was a threat to international peace.

* He will have noted that the Director-General of Social **Security**, in a statement which has just been incorporated in  Hansard,  announced that Miss Karen Green had not taken reasonable steps to find employment, in accordance with the Social Services Act, and stated that he had sought advice on legal aspects of her claim from the Commonwealth's legal advisers.

* The Attorney-General might guess that ordinarily I would not ask him to table legal advisings; but, since the Minister for Social **Security** did in fact, during the early stages of this dispute- on 7 December last- table the advice that one of his predecessors gave to one of her predecessors with regard to students on vacation not being regarded as unemployed, I ask him whether he will table the advice given to the Director-General on a subject that concerns about 35 000 young applicants.

* This withdrawal would then be carried out as swiftly as possible, having regard to the **security** of Australian troops and the need for a brief transitional period so that alternative arrangements could be made.

* In the opinion of one observer, Professor Milton Osborne of Monash University, it is doubtful whether the level of **security** in the province has changed greatly since 1967 despite the presence of the Task Force.

* At a time in which unemployment has reached the level of tragedy, this Government is still preoccupied with the use of the social **security** system for what can only be described as social control.

* The Government is interested to use the social **security** system to support its repressive industrial legislation.

* The only realistic **security** then available to the lender is surety of return of funds and service to loans via the cash flow from the company's earnings.

* My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I now ask: Will the Minister confirm that interpreters attached to the Department of Social **Security**'s telephone interpreter service, who used to assist doctors, lawyers, social workers and the police during interviews with non-English speaking migrants, can no longer offer this service because of the financial restrictions applied to the operations of the Department?

* I have to say that the Indian authorities have been most forthcoming in giving firm undertakings concerning the **security** of our players.

* I understand that the players themselves were prepared to play at Srinagar on the understanding, of course, that adequate **security** arrangements would be made.

* I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* There has been a threat to the **security** of title to what has been discovered.

* Above all, explorers require **security** of tenure.

* No government can make such a loan without having some form of **security**.

* Naturally enough it demands **security** for a first mortgage.

* That responsibility is, amongst other things, to safeguard the national health and the national **security** of this country.

* Any person, no matter from which area he comes, must be assessed in terms of his capacity to fit in with Australia's national health requirements and national **security** requirements.

* When the former Minister for External Affairs and former honourable member for Forrest,  Mr Gordon  Freeth - the present Ambassador to Japan - introduced his infamous new Government line on the proposed Soviet **security** treaty in the Indian Ocean, etc., in 1969, I was the first in this Parliament to place on record strong criticism of our linking ourselves in any way in  a  **security** treaty with the Soviet Union, just as I criticised our involvement with the United States of America in Vietnam and our involvement with the United Kingdom in the Malaysian-Indonesian crisis.

* This sense of **security** received a severe jolt with the election of a Labor Government and the appointment of the present Minister for Housing.

* I refer the honourable gentleman to the statement in the annual report of the Department of Social **Security**, tabled in the House yesterday, that there is an extensive waiting list of voluntary agencies seeking financial assistance under the migrant social worker grant-in-aid scheme.

* In view of the fact that five of the limited number of positions available under this scheme have never been filled by the Fraser Government and the fact that at least double that number of such positions are now vacant, will he express to the Minister for Social **Security** the concern of the ethnically-based voluntary organisations about the Government's casual approach and urge her to cut the waiting list which she has extended so unecessarily?

* -I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**: Is it a fact that section 7 of the Social Services Act 1947-76 provides that the Director-General of Social Services shall be subject to any direction of the Minister in the administration of that Act?

* Is it also a fact that on 23 March 1976, the Minister for Social **Security**, in a Press statement and in subsequent correspondence, issued a directive to the Director-General that unemployment benefits would not be paid to school leavers during the long vacation and that this blanket policy was subsequently found to be invalid by the High Court?

* I turn now to the social welfare program in which total direct outlays on social **security** and welfare are estimated to increase from $3,703m in 1974-75 to $4,772m in 1975-76.

* Therefore direct outlays on social **security** and welfare in 1975-76 will be equivalent to 21.8 per cent of the estimated total Budget outlays.

* I should mention one other, if I may be permitted to do so, for whom I have the most enormous respect; that is our Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Margaret  Guilfoyle.

* As a result of the activity of the Treasurer and the Minister for Social **Security**, we have at last shown the pensioners of Australia that a Liberal-National Country Party Government not only will honour its promises but also will do more for them than Labor ever did.

* **Security** of employment is important but **security** to the employer is important as well.

* I think my colleague the Minister for Social **Security** has already issued a statement on this matter.

* But I must say that the arguments that were put by the deputation yesterday to  Senator Guilfoyle  and myself seemed to be so compelling that we should take advantage of the opportunity to move amendments to the social **security** legislation that is before the House so that lone fathers will be able to get the same benefit as supporting mothers and so that they will not be denied that benefit any longer than is absolutely necessary.

* The matter for discussion refers to the 'serious implications for the **security** of Australia'.

* If there are serious implications for the **security** of Australia in what is going on in Vietnam now the.

* Those who have had a long association with, say, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill and those who have been associated with the administration of the law for a long time know that it can happen here.

* The report of the Hope Commission into the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation uses condemnatory words about an excess of power and bureaucratic designs by ASIO to show that its officers were capable of detecting crimes that had never been committed and having people wrongly blamed.

* The major areas of government expenditure are as follows: Defence, 8.7 per cent; education, 8.8 per cent; health, 10.5 per cent; social **security** and welfare, 27.2 per cent; and States and local government, transfer of payments, 21.8 per cent.

* If we are not to reduce expenditure in those other four areas which provide benefits that people need- I refer to education, health, social **security**; and much of the money provided by way of States grants goes into those areas- we have to be prepared to take away benefits from those who are not in need.

* The conventional theory, with which I cannot agree, is that **security** of tenure is necessary so that permanent heads will always be willing to provide unpalatable advice to Ministers without fear of losing their jobs.

* The valuable tradition of frankness and forthrightness in Public Service advice is sustained not by **security** of tenure but by the character and integrity of the men and women appointed to senior positions.

* If we expect to be allied with other countries, as we must be to adequately protect the **security** of Australia and its people, we should be prepared, as other countries are prepared, to spend a reasonable proportion of our national income on retaining our defence forces in a reasonably strong position.

* This is part of the price we should be prepared to pay for the **security** that we now enjoy.

* I have already had discussions with the Minister for Social **Security** who reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the abolition of the means test for all people over the age of 65 years, but she indicated that the Government's first priority is to the reduction of inflation and that it was not possible to indicate when the means test would be abolished.

* I can appreciate, as indeed the Minister for Social **Security** appreciates, that this could well have caused some confusion in the minds of people.

* I believe that the Australian people, rather than wanting to own their own homes, want **security** of tenure of premises.

* All I want is **security** of tenure of premises while I am alive and to ensure that when my wife lives on after me she will be accommodated.

* I challenge the Minister for Special Trade Representations  (Mr Garland),  who is handling this legislation in this place, to inform the House whether it is a fact that the Department of Social **Security** recommended a 30 per cent increase in the level of benefits.

* If the Department of Social **Security** recommended 30 per cent, why was it cut to 12 per cent?

* Last year when the Government took its decision to introduce annual indexation adjustments of social **security** and repatriation pensions and benefits, it was with the prospect of a lower rate of inflation than now prevails.

* Until now it was left to the discretion of the Department of Social **Security** to make a decision as to whether a person ought to be suspended from employment benefits for the full six weeks, regardless of whether there were any good reasons.

* If we look at the rules and regulations which have been produced by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, dated September 1979, we find that regulation 15 states: 
The Social Services Amendment Bill which we are debating gives to the officers of the Department of Social **Security** the right to deprive citizens of between $347 and $1,158 by withholding unemployment benefits.

* As I said yesterday, the Minister for Social **Security** and I have had discussions about the funding of women's refuges in the future.

* By a process of elimination only one ground remained, namely, an adverse **security** report on the man.

* In the opinion of the Ukranianspeaking Australian, it was a joke that this man could be regarded as a **security** risk.

* He may have noted that the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister representing her in this chamber both declined last week to state the Government's policy on the payment of unemployment benefit to school leavers.

* Now that the High Court has declared that the policy being pursued by the DirectorGeneral of Social **Security** under the Government's direction was illegal but that a directive to comply with the Social Services Act must come from die Government and not the Court, I ask: Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking that Miss Karen Green's application for unemployment benefit will be reconsidered in the light of the Court's declaration?

* Is the Minister for Social **Security** aware of an article in a Western Australian newspaper of 15 September which quotes a witness appearing before the Senate Select Committee on Social Environment as saying that social **security** cheques for some Aboriginals in East Perth were mailed straight to a wine saloon?

* This is particularly noticeable to someone who works in an electorate in which there is a heavy concentration of migrants, particularly southern Europeans and more recently Latin Americans, and sees how they are treated in terms of our social **security** policy in comparison with Anglo-Saxon migrants.

* -The Opposition shares the disquiet about these Bills- the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Amendment Bill, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill and the Customs Amendment Bill (No.

* Mr CHIPP (Hotham) &lt;8.38)- The report which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has tabled is one for which all honourable members and all parties who are interested in social welfare have been waiting a long time.

* The Minister for Social **Security** could not resist his usual tilt at the Opposition in the last couple of sentences of his speech, the part of which he never gives me a copy.

* The initiatives already taken in the fields of education, housing and social **security** alone are the beginning, to use the GovernorGeneral's own words, of a program designed to achieve basic changes in the administration and structure of Australian society.

* Promised social **security** and repatriation pension increases backdated to early December will soon be paid.

* Will the Prime Minister say who authorised the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to crudely attempt to interrogate certain members of the Wheat Board regarding China during the period in question?

* These are people who went into what was a bush area and pioneered a district, went without the usual facilities planning to retire to small properties to provide **security** for them and their families.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I remember having a discussion with senior officials of the Department of Social **Security** who were connected with the development of the Medibank program when I was Minister for Social **Security**.

* -The Office of National Assessments Bill constitutes a first and important step towards implementing the recommendations of the royal commission into the intelligence and **security** services of the Australian Government.

* The inquiry was intended to cover the whole range of Australia's intelligence and **security** services.

* Nevertheless, the Department of Social **Security** has advised that the current annual cost, based on November 1976 rates, is probably within the range of $280-300m.

* The Department of Social **Security** has advised that the estimated annual cost of reducing the age limit for means-test-free pensions is as follows: 
-I direct to the Minister representing the Attorney-General a question which is central to growing public concern on the issue of national **security**.

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to public reports that today the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has flown agents from Canberra to Sydney to take possession of documents from a couple?

* Let me say to the honourable member for Henty, to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and to the Government that I do not hear of any massive numbers of people being hurt because this legislation has not been enacted.

* Perhaps when he replies the Minister for Social **Security** can tell me what is the massive number of people who have been hurt or whether any people have been adversely affected because this proposed legislation has not become law.

* If there were a prize for persistence on the part of Ministers it must surely go to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I suggest to the Minister for Social **Security** that the operative and important word is 'consideration'.

* The then Minister for Health was giving consideration to introducing legislation, every the inference to be drawn from what the Minister for Social **Security** said is that the Liberal-Country Party Government was going to introduce legislation.

* Why does not the Government introduce a scheme to provide cover for the 8 per cent of Australians or one million people referred to this morning by the Minister for Social **Security** as not being covered at present?

* Uninsured people who receive social **security**, unemployment, sickness and special benefits in fact have to wait 2 weeks before they are eligible to receive those benefits.

* Correspondence on the matter of inadequate pre-school funding was sent to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in August and September.

* Mr Speaker,  I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  copies of correspondence and telegrams to the Minister for Social **Security** and a table of statistics relating to the allocation of funds to pre-schools in Australia.

* Senator The Honourable M. G. M. Guilfoyle Minister for Social **Security**, The Senate, Parliament House, Canberra, ACT 2600 
My amendment is designed to leave the Comptroller of Customs with the responsibility of discharging certain powers and authorities conferred upon him by this Parliament and to enforce the law, particularly in regard to drug and narcotic trafficking, but it precludes that information from Ministers on the same basis that this Parliament precludes from Ministers information about the taxation affairs of any individual and, in a similar way but not quite so strictly, precludes from Ministers information about health and social **security** matters.

* Rather, we must approach the future with a swagger, welcome those who are willing to spend and let companies make money so that people get jobs, **security** and a higher standard of living.

* I have not the slightest doubt that that would provide much greater confidence within the Australian economy and greater **security** and greater employment opportunities for many thousands of Australians.

* To justify an expenditure of this magnitude it is necessary, or often vital, for the manufacturer to have reasonable **security** in the home market, which in turn provides a base on which to develop exports.

* The social welfare policy secretariat will be physically located in the Department of Social **Security**.

* Let me summarise by saying that  Dr Sidney  Sax and his secretariat will cover the whole range of social welfare and health programs, with a far-ranging brief that will support the planning and programming activities of many departments, but primarily, of course, those of the Department of Social **Security** and those of my own Department.

* The third is that in matters of fundamental importance, such as **security** of life and limb, all members of society have equal rights and claims upon society.

* My fourth value judgment is that any government is responsible to its people for the protection of that physical **security**.

* They left those societies because the societies were no longer able to offer their members reasonable **security** of their own lives.

* Since that time we have been lulled into a sense of false **security**.

* The nationalisation of life assurance- which in itself is a self-help social **security** system- could well be used as the backdoor to complete nationalisation and Government control.

* In speaking in support of the views of honourable members on this side of the House I feel it is appropriate to remind the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that the LiberalCountry Party teams have been steadfast in their opposition to what he proposes since the day he arrived and set about to nationalise health in this country.

* I have said in this House on previous occasions that it amazes me that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  a fellow Queenslander, can come into this House every couple of months and introduce measures which will do nothing for the people of Queensland but impose a heavy financial burden.

* The protective services division has nothing to do with terrorism and very little to do with **security**.

* Its main task will be to guard Commonwealth places with low, and in many instances, nil **security** risks.

* -Does the Minister for National Development accept responsibility for an official minute circulated at Lucas Heights Atomic Research Establishment which seeks to justify escalation of **security** arrangements in the HIFAR reactor area?

* I do not speak of minor matters -counterproductive cheeseparing, which loses more than it gains; such things as failure to correct social **security** anomalies- I do not even speak of our refusal to face up to the corrosive effect of our system of unemployment benefits, but rather of the general policy of restriction where expansion is called for, and of the pathetic reliance upon monetary measures taken mechanically and uncomprehendingly.

* In his repeated evasions of questions about the reasons for  Senator Murphy's  midnight raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation offices in Canberra - an evasion which continued in the debate which was gagged in this House this week - did the Prime Minister, by his own definition of the word, lie and lie, and lie again to this House?

* Unlike the honourable member, I do not agree that too much of the Commonwealth purse, too much of the federal funds is being spent on social **security**.

* Any one of these estimates for the Department of Health, the Department of Repatriation and the Department of Social **Security** with which we are dealing gives no consideration to a very significant group in our community and they are the people who are deaf.

* If this does add to the amount of money spent on social **security**, and that in turn incurs the wrath of the honourable member for Petrie, I make no apology.

* The nation is searching for stability and **security** as practised by the Liberal-Country Party governments over the years, which we will again translate into action after the next election.

* Again, the question of information cannot be the subject of appeal because a **security** assessment can be denied if the AttorneyGeneral says so.

* An adverse **security** assessment can be made against us and if we are not told that it exists what chance do we have of appealing?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-I happened to be working on the tarmac and evacuating children from schools in buses while a Labor senator was strutting around like a peacock doing nothing.

* The Minister for Social **Security** probably has not been there yet.

* The Minister for Social **Security** should go to Darwin and assess the situation.

* For example, if we wanted to live in the past we could argue from our point of view about the effects that the levels of inflation caused by the actions of the previous Labor Government had on the basic **security** of all pensioners.

* I move on to the reference that the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Newman)  made in his second reading speech to the income **security** review committee.

* I referred also to some other problems that I hoped would be looked at by the income **security** review committee or, if not that committee, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* If the person concerned goes to the counter at the Social **Security** office he cannot get that cheque paid out over the counter.

* I hope that the income **security** review committee will propose some sort of net which will cover the varying complexities in the minimum benefit area.

* I want to comment once again on the importance of a humane approach being adopted at the counter of a Social **Security** office.

* I have always received most courteous service from people at all levels of the Department of Social **Security** and other government offices.

* I do not want to single out particularly the Department of Social **Security** but these Bills are concerned with that particular subject.

* I am not singling out the Department of Social **Security** here; I mean all government offices.

* Secondly, I believe it would also help senior management in all government departments, including the Department of Social **Security**, to identify definitely who is the offender when a complaint is lodged and can do something about it.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 12 October 1978: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 31 May 1977: 
How many social **security** beneficiaries received (a) no increase and (b) a partial increase only in May 1977 due to the change in the means test preventing the conversion of certain incomes to assets in November 1 976.

* I intend to dwell at least for a minute or two on the matter of the defence and **security** of this country.

* (Quorum formed) I want particularly to draw attention to the tremendous reforms that have already been introduced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham).

* I suggest to the Minister for Social **Security** that in the future, when the necessary finance is available, this is something which should receive very definite thought.

* Apart from that, I think that most honourable members would agree that both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social **Security** have already done a wonderful job.

* In the Department of Social **Security** they include the Australian Assistance Plan funds, which I have already mentioned: the grants to organisations under the Disabled Persons Homes Act, the Handicapped Persons As:sistance Act and the Aged Persons Hostels Act: and funds for various community welfare organisations such as the Australian Council for Social Service and the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled.

* 1 ) under the Department of Social **Security** to which the Opposition in another place is refusing to agree.

* If the Revenue Fund were to run into deficit, those payments from it, whether to other governments, to persons on social **security**, or for administrative purposes, would all fall short.

* I share the Prime Minister's attitude that one does not comment on matters of intelligence or **security**.

* The Prime Minister's statement is based on a flagrant and deliberate confusion between Australia's military and internal **security** and Australia's interests as a sovereign power.

* Mr Agee  has aroused the anger of the British Government and he is being deported for unspecified activities harmful to the **security** of the United Kingdom.

* The shadow Minister for Social **Security** and Welfare,  Mr Chipp,  flew from Canberra to Sydney yesterday to give a press conference because he claimed the Opposition was being gagged and guillotined into silence by the Government.

* Whilst I can understand the Opposition, in the name of a bipartisan approach to **security** in Australia, seeking to be as fully informed as possible about the activities of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, I think there are places where the functions of government must be separated from and seen to be distinct from the need for information to be provided to the Opposition.

* The Director-General shall consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives for the purpose of keeping him informed on matters relating to **security**.

* In other words, there is a duty upon the DirectorGeneral to consult with the Leader of the Opposition and to keep the Leader of the Opposition informed on matters relating to **security**.

* I think that really, looked at in that way, our declining to accept this amendment in no way detracts from our concern as a government to bring to bear a bipartisan approach to the operation of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
In a way I suppose that they introduced some of it, but this is one of the more interesting pieces of legislation of this Parliament in the long haul to obtain reasonable retirement provisions for the people in the defence services.

* It is interesting that it has always been difficult to have such reforms accepted as reasonable social **security** projects.

* This was recognised by Professor Henderson in his report on poverty as one of the major social injustices in our present social **security** arrangements.

* I believe the income test is unsatisfactory and unfair, but with a greater understanding by both farmers and officers from the Department of Social **Security** of how the system works, hopefully the scheme will be more successful next winter than last.

* At the same time I want to compliment the way in which senior social **security** officers worked to obtain a viable arrangement for the introduction of this assistance.

* He has a paranoid fear of plots against his life and he is always taking extraordinary **security** measures to overcome them, imaginary or otherwise.

* Obote 's old opponents want to ensure that 
I am glad to say that Australia's Ambassador to the United Nations is continuing to act throughout this month as the  President  of the **Security** Council.

* In these circumstances, the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations - the  President  of the **Security** Council - is making undiminished efforts to bring about an end of hostilities.

* -I refer the Prime Minister to the debate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill on 3 May this year when the Opposition urged the establishment of a Nuclear Safeguards, Safety and **Security** Commission to set standards for aspects of safeguards, to make rules for physical **security**, to set physical safety standards, to issue and withdraw licences for construction and to carry out investigations and inquiries.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: 
1 ) What arrangements are made in the Department of Social **Security** and statutory authorities under the Minister's control for the recycling of waste materials such as paper, metals and glass.

* The reason for this is that it is believed by the Government that it is essential to keep the whole normal financing of the rural industry going and if we were to pull out the **security** which traditionally has been the base on which the whole of the wool industry has operated it would be difficult for those people who traditionally finance the industry to continue to do so.

* Nowhere in history have people always had the **security** of knowing that they could do, for all their working life, the one job with the one set of skills without some requirement to have retraining.

* The greatest effort must be made to ensure **security** not only as to the movements but also as to the timing and the size of the movements.

* 1 believe, and I am so informed by the highest military technical experts advising the ; Government, that any kind of a debate : which could be likely to disclose the method of withdrawal or the timing or other facts associated with the withdrawal could be only of harm to the **security** of the Australian forces.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has responded to the representations that the honourable member has made, so I understand, to ensure that the problem to which he alluded is overcome by allowing the State Director of the Department of Social **Security** to handle applications from unemployed farmers outside the categories to which the honourable member referred.

* I should also like to congratulate both the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Treasurer on their excellent Budget **security**.

* This Budget has involved one of the best **security** exercises in many years, far better, considering especially the leaks from the previous Labor Government Budgets last year and the year before.

* I think it is important that people realise that when we are debating foreign affairs we are debating matters which have a fundamental effect upon the future and **security** of the community and the nation at large.

* I believe that the people's **security** and the permanence of the nation are matters for continuing public debate and matters on which there should be continuing public information.

* The reason for using the 707 aircraft is the same reason why the aircraft were purchased in the first place, that is, because of strongly worded **security** advice in general terms in relation to heads of state and heads of government but also in this circumstance in relation to a head of state.

* I think that especially in regard to the nature of the event which is to take place in London- the funeral of Earl Mountbatten- and the causes for that funeral, one could well understand the importance of that **security** advice.

* I should like to address myself to the estimates for both the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Health.

* Dealing now with the Department of Social **Security**, page 88 of the explanatory notes indicate that the pension will go up to $43.50 a week and, being geared to the consumer price index, the Department predicts that from autumn of 1977 the amount will go up to $46.50.

* Let me deal with one other percentage which I have found interesting, and I would be grateful if the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  is able to give any figures.

* It would be an interesting exercise in statistics from the Department of Social **Security**.

* By the end of this Parliament Australia will have a comprehensive and generous system of social **security** benefits with universal health insurance, national superannuation, national compensation and a system of guaranteed income, as the key ingredients of that program.

* This will give Australia one of the best social **security** benefits systems in the world.

* The Government's expenditure on social **security** items in 1977-78 is a big increase on the amount provided for the previous year.

* The increase is thoughout the whole orbit of social **security**- special social service pensions, repatriation benefits, handicapped people's allowances, aged persons accommodation, children's services and unemployment benefits.

* Should the Board find that antidumping action is not justified the honourable member can rest assured that the earliest possible action will be taken to process the report so that the cash **security** action can be discontinued and refunds of deposits on past shipments made.

* Compensation being paid to shopkeepers by the Commonwealth is for loss of profits as a result of the closure of their business premises, on **security** grounds, for the duration of the Conference.

* It is not for losses incurred as a result of the bomb explosion but arises from a specific **security** decision.

* That means that they must have absolute **security** on the reserves upon which they live.

* Does this legislation guarantee the personal **security** of Aborigines?

* The only way we can ensure the satisfactory **security** of the people of Aurukun, Mornington Island and other places is to acquire the land and deed it to the Aboriginal communities.

* There is only one absolute **security**.

* In the current state of our society, in the current state of Australian politics, in our obsession with regard to minerals, there is only one absolute **security** for the Aboriginal people of Queensland and elsewhere, and that is the acquisition of the land and the vesting of it in them absolutely.

* The Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  and many others have carried out vicious attacks on the Opposition's suggestions for sound economic management.

* The scope of the Rural Reconstruction Authority would shift from its existing supplementary lending role to one where, in instances similar to those of the average farmers I have mentioned, total long term and carry-on needs could be approved against the **security** of a property mortgage.

* The Minister suggested that an authority to mine issued under section 4 1 of the Atomic Energy Act failed to afford this **security** of tenure.

* We will implement our policy of preventing the exploitation of Australian uranium while its use poses unsolved threats to the environment, human health and welfare and to international **security**.

* The Government is not making a grant to the industry; it is involved in a normal business transaction and it is being paid interest at commercial rates with full **security** for its loan.

* In answer to questions Nos 907 and 908 I was told by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the former Minister for Veteran's Affairs,  Senator Durack,  that the departments had no discretion as to who could act as warrantors.

* I was approached by a number of people earlier this year- people from service and religious bodies and even Department of Social **Security** personnel.

* It was introduced on the recommendation of a joint committee on social **security** chaired by a predecessor of the Minister for Repatriation as the member for Bass.

* I was interested to hear the honourable member for Hotham refer to a passage in the Minister's second reading speech about the Government proceeding with a review of income **security**.

* It would be absolutely deplorable if a committee formed to consider the very important question of income **security** review were to meet in private.

* The ASEAN countries have firmly held that ASEAN is not, and should not be, a **security** organisation or a military pact.

* Before I came into the chamber, I looked at the map and noticed that we have two arcs of **security** to our north.

* A secure neighbourhood with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea gives us our first line of **security**.

* The second arc or second line of **security** comprises the Philippines, the other Indonesian islands, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.

* I believe that we are obliged for our own **security** and stability in the future to give them a fair share of trade.

* I said earlier that a stable, prosperous and secure ASEAN provides an important guarantee for Australia's future **security**.

* There is no scope for complacency about what we must do to ensure the future **security** of Australia.

* We must hope to establish circumstances by diplomacy, by policies of economic assistance, by policies of regional **security**, in which the countries of our region will be able to devote their full resources to improving the standard of life of their own people.

* There is increased social **security** and welfare spending.

* The automatic adjustment of social **security** pensions and benefits will result in increases in November, and again in May 1978, and repatriation disability pensions and Service pensions will rise in the same way.

* Admittedly it will have some branch offices of the Department of Social **Security** as well as Commonwealth Employment Service offices, but they are not located in every centre.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2) and (3) I refer the honourable member to the table on page 1 16 of the Annual Report of the DirectorGeneral, Department of Social **Security**, for 1975-76, which gives information in relation to pensions paid overseas under the portability arrangements.

* It is true at this juncture, as has been stated elsewhere, that no decision on the timing of the handover of control of internal **security**, which is wider than just police functions, has been reached.

* However, the timing of the transfer of any responsibility for things such as internal **security** will be a matter for decision in the context of the developing political and administrative arrangements between Australia and Papua New Guinea.

* Has the Prime Minister seen reports that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is now using laser beams to listen to telephone conversations from up to 2 miles distance?

* Finally, will the Prime Minister consider placing a total import ban on the procurement of such equipment by anyone, including State police forces but excluding only an organisation properly authorised to protect this nation's **security**?

* 1 ) I am informed that an Interdepartmental Committee chaired by the Department of Social **Security** is currently studying matters affecting descendants of South Sea Islanders living in Australia.

* The Interdepartmental Committee which first met on 17 December 1975, will report its recommendations to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The question is: When will Australia come under potential pressures in the future which might affect our national **security**?

* We will not be able to guarantee our future **security**.

* The third point that I think is worthwhile putting on the record is that the police can only communicate any information about nonnarcotics activities- this point was raised by the honourable member for Bonython in particularobtained from any intercepts to other members of the police force or State and Northern Territory police forces if those activities relate to serious crimes with penalties of not less than three years' imprisonment and of course relate to Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and **security** matters.

* Might I say that in all the matters raised by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and other Opposition members in this place and in the Senate in connection with the so-called social **security** frauds, no one has mentioned that only one complaint has been lodged with the Ombudsman.

* Within this building hundreds of people work quietly behind the scenes to provide refreshment and transport facilities and to ensure that **security** is maintained at all times.

* You, sir, have already referred to  Mr Worth  who has assisted as co-ordinator of **security** in this building.

* The great advantage of manufacturing industries in becoming more involved in the export market is not that this just widens the base of our export potential and therefore gives us a high degree of **security** and stability, but, for manufacturing industries, the whole basis of success in their operations, resulting in their becoming more viable, is volume of production.

* The Minister in his reply and in a subsequent statement said that an important point which weighed against the Government's doing so was that, although the passport was issued after the **Security** Council's resolution, it was issued before the official took up his present appointment.

* I now ask why the Government did not consider that the **Security** Council resolution had just as much application to this official at the time he was granted the Aus tralian passport, insofar as he was at that time the commander of the Rhodesian Air Force.

* Is he aware of a statement by  Dr Kissinger  on 25 October which indicated that the alert of United States forces around the world which was ordered by  President  Nixon had been undertaken as a result of a unanimous recommendation by the National **Security** Council?

* Is the Prime Minister also aware that  Dr Kissinger  had also indicated that the National **Security** Council had reached this recommendation while the  President  was not even present?

* The Government's deep concern about the outbursts of violence and its commitment to what effectively means an expansion of the spy functions of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation pose severe and real threats to the civil liberties of many honest Australians active in movements which do not please the Government's philosophy of big business making profits at all costs.

* I would like to make a point about the clamp down on terrorism, the tightening of **security** and the unprecedented use of troops in Sydney and Bowral in recent weeks.

* The special branches and the whole **security** network, including the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, the Joint Intelligence Organisation and even the Australian **Security** Intelligence Service exist purely to preserve the status quo.

* But to ensure that their real intentions are not thwarted, they surround themselves with spies and **security** bodies.

* But he would not know the first thing about **security**.

* In the wake of the sensations, with the whole **security** network feeling somewhat insecure and probably feeling itself under the microscope from the Press, although in reality the Press analysis was little better than a scratchy monocle, with the conservative governments and conservative oppositions of this country worried about what dirty linen might come out in the wash, with business disturbed that one of its strongest supporters was under attack, the Sydney bombing got them off the hook.

* Public opinion polls condition people to accept the fact that the use of troops in the interests of the **security** of this country will be the order of the day.

* The present Government is committed to rebuilding Australia so that there is job **security** for the people, production of wealth and social **security** in a real sense for the people.

* The Department of Social **Security** discussed the application with my Department on 22 April 1975 (in accordance with a procedure which requires prior consultation with respect to any project for funding under the Australian Assistance Plan which may have an education content).

* The Committee had been further informed that as it was involved also in providing a community service generally, financial assistance might be available from the Department of Social **Security**.

* They would angrily repudiate the charge, if anyone had the temerity to make it, but I fear that there are a few who quite unconsciously are afraid of any change in the centralist- they would say centralised '-organisations that enmesh them in false **security**.

* The 10 year period is considered the minimum normally necessary for **security** checking purposes.

* Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Chief of Staff that an adequate **security** check has been possible, the 10 year rule may be waived.

* The 10 year rule does not apply where an adequate **security** check has been possible.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
This legislation should be wide enough to deal with the other matters which have been the subject of amendments foreshadowed earlier in the second reading debate.

* As a matter of interest, the United Nations **Security** Council adopted a resolution in respect of Rhodesia as far back as 27 May 1977 and asked all states to adopt that resolution.

* I draw the attention of the House to the fact that in June of last year, which was prior to that statement being made, the Australian Government sent a communication to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the following terms: 
how many Commonwealth Police Officers were detailed for any **security** duties relating to occupants of the motor car on that date, and 
The number of people out of work has increased dramatically while this Government has been in power, particularly young people and older workers.

* The Government has sought to introduce into the social **security** system and into the employment service a method of relating pensions and benefits to a whole range of discriminatory actions.

* In February 1978, there was a direction that all 250 field officers of the Department of Social **Security** concentrate on unemployment beneficiaries and carry out door-to-door checks.

* In last year's Budget the Government introduced a measure whereby it increased the staff of the Department of Social **Security** at a cost of $100m, simply for the purpose of checking on people, harassing the unemployed and other perhaps similarly undeserving or potentially undeserving social **security** beneficiaries.

* It has nothing to do with welfare, and yet that is part of this social **security** legislation.

* Finally, although the long service leave and workmen's compensation amendments relate to areas normally within the responsibility of my colleagues, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security**, the particular provisions relate only to railway employees and for this reason it was thought more appropriate to amend the Railways Act, rather than other Commonwealth legislation.

* I do not wish to state whether I accept the accuracy of the version given by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representative concerning the points put by the representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* (2) and (3) The **security** .-measures taken have been designed to ensure that there is adequate **security** at the Prime Minister's Lodge at all times.

* I am advised that it has not been the general practice in the CES to report to the Department of Social **Security** those without such a history who decline fruit-picking outside their local area.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* That is ridiculous when one looks at it from the point of view of prejudicing **security**.

* That gets away from the whole point of clause 6 which deals with the possibility of not reporting under certain circumstances which would prejudice the **security**, defence, international relations or relations between the Commonwealth and any State.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The question of Australian participation in reciprocal arrangements on social **security** with other countries is presently being given very serious and urgent consideration.

* The failure to obtain adequate treatment or advice for financial reasons would frequently lead to chronic ill-health, requiring social **security** payments, or even acute medical tragedies.

* -I call the Minister for Social **Security**.

* So recently, for example, we had the debate on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
When the **security** of a defence unit is involved, I suggest that there is not much difference between 'misleading' and inadequate'.

* He states:  lt was not that ihe Army was out of Phuoc Tuy that was of concern but the fact that the price paid in some loss of **security** in Phuoc Tuy in 1968 during and after the Tei offensive was not brought adequately (o attention under the reporting system then used.

* In answering a question from the Leader of the Australian Country Party last Thursday, the Prime Minister excluded the Deputy Prime Minister from the list he gave of Ministers whose staff had been given full **security** clearances.

* If the **security** of this country was not assured, then no other matter would be of consequence.

* Australian people, God bless them, effective protection and assured **security**; and, secondly, at the same time expose the manner in which this present Government, hell bent on a snivelling subservience to every little tin-pot communist country, has emasculated the Army, ripped out its heart and wounded- as yet not mortally, but near enough to it- the proud morale of our defence forces.

* Our fourth objective is to promote the active functioning of regional defence arrangements to maintain the **security** of South East Asia, South West Pacific and the Indian Ocean areas.

* In 1 97 1 Commonwealth and State Government Ministers approved a recommendation of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence that, for the purposes of control and **security**, cultivation should be limited to Tasmania.

* My responsibility under this legislation relates to **security** of manufacture and handling.

* Officials authorised under the Narcotics Drugs Act carry out regular inspections of company records and **security** measures.

* The other interesting aspect of this debate- I think it will be obvious as the debate unfolds- is that we will be able to discern those who do not wish to have a **security** organisation in Australia at all and those who simply desire to improve the structure and substance of the legislation.

* From the very nature of the subversive acts intended to be kept under surveillance it must be a matter of judgment, both by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation as well as by society, because a mixture of social, political and constitutional elements of the framework of Australian democracy are involved.

* In 1974 the Whitlam Government established the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** under the chairmanship of  Mr Justice  Hope.

* These include, of course, the application of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards of indefinite duration and cover all peaceful nuclear activities in nonnuclear weapon states, the prohibition of nuclear explosive uses, the maintenance of adequate physical **security**, and United States consent to re-transfer, et cetera.

* It is not so long ago that the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works was offering to the public interest rates for its loans of about 3 per cent or 4 per cent and investors who were looking for **security** of investment were attracted.

* I ask the Prime Minister Why was the raid on Australian' **Security** Intelligence Organisation, to quote the words which he himself used in his recent television performance, the worst mistake of the Labor Government'?

* Was the raid by **security** officers on the homes of a number of Croatian-born Australians, made under the provisions of section 38 of the Crimes Act, seeking evidence of whether Australia is being used as a base for subversive actions against a foreign power?

* Again there has been an increase in the number of people being trained under a new scheme- an increase in the number of people going forward and being involved in programs which are worthwhile and which will provide future employment for themselves and future **security** for their loved ones.

* Regardless of whether that is so and whether that could be proved to be the case, the fact is that companies are concerned about these matters, that they are taking **security** protection measures and that, as I understand it, they are linking with the proper authorities in order to try to track down the groups that may be indulging in this type of activity.

* First, it says that activists must maintain strict **security**.

* The mood of the nation is for stability, **security** and certainty.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Practices Tribunal and the Director-General of **Security**.

* Did the Prime Minister in a recent television interview- if I may say so, this seems to be his presently preferred forum for national policy comment- when questioned about a telex message from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation refer in derogatory tones to the **security** of Australian **security** forces?

* Does he hold the same views on the **security** of his own Cabinet over the publication of the Coombs Report?

* He ought to look at the statement by the former Minister for Social **Security** in another place,  Senator Wheeldon,  made in August last, when the then Government announced that there would be no more funds this financial year for homes for the aged.

* Of course the result of that is that there is once again- this could equally be applied to clause 35- a great deal of discretion for the Department of Social **Security** and for the officer concerned of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Furthermore, the circumstances in which someone left work may well be, as has been suggested earlier, circumstances which people are not anxious to communicate, certainly not to an officer of the Department of Social **Security** and quite possibly not to an officer at that particular level.

* In the first place, there are questions of **security**.

* Surely no honourable member will suggest that **security** in relation to a telephone exchange is unimportant.

* These days I think most honourable members expect that the utmost **security** will be preserved.

* The Prime Minister will recall that the Attorney-General, in the context of that Minister's raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, has said that it was necessary to seal ASIO safes and filing cabinets in order to preserve documents.

* Was there any person or persons in ASIO whom the Attorney-General mistrusted, or did the Attorney-General mistrust the **Security** Service itself?

* -Is the Minister for Repatriation aware of the recent change, which nas been widely welcomed, in the payment provisions for pensions administered by the Department of Social **Security** whereby pensioners now can have cheques paid direct into their bank accounts?

* Will he consider taking steps to put the method of payment of repatriation compensation on the same basis as that now applying to recipients of social **security** benefits?

* For the longer term the prospects of the vast majority for employment and economic **security** are poor.

* I might say that the adjustments in private interest rates have been measured, are appropriate to the movements in Government **security** yields and are largely confined to short term securities.

* Did the present Minister for Labor and Immigration state on 17 September 1 972, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, that in order to give citizens protection against possible unjust or inaccurate use of ASIO reports a Labor Government would establish an administrative court of appeals to review administrative decisions, decisions made on **security** grounds, to lay down regulations governing the conduct of members of ASIO and other **security** organisations and to hear, determine and report to Parliament on the breach of any such regulations.

* I remind the Government and the honourable members here that whatever criticism they may like to make of resource allocation in this country - the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  talks of resource allocation with great frequency - and whatever new policies they think ought to be implemented, the wealth of this country today that they have to use to implement their welfare and other policies was created under the climate of Liberal-Country Party governments which were in power, as the House knows, for many years.

* and (4) The Department of Social **Security** was advised of the intention to conduct the survey and discussions were held with that Department on the question of extending it to encompass details of registrants in receipt of Unemployment Benefits.

* Following completion of the survey the Minister for Social **Security** was advised of the results and the matter was further considered but, as the individual records from the survey had been destroyed by the Commonwealth Statistician, no action could be taken.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  referred to senior citizens centres.

* I am, however, far from satisfied with the piecemeal manner in which social workers or welfare officers are subsidised within the range of the related subjects of immigration, repatriation, social **security** and other social welfare needs.

* Did his Department indicate to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in 1973 that costs of bringing cattle from Europe through a high **security** offshore quarantine station would be $2,300 per head, excluding the value of the animal or transport; if so, what would be the current estimated cost.

* On the question of employment levels and job **security**, he said: 
There is well documented evidence in the Public Service annual report, the Coombs Royal Commission and for many other speakers of substance on the matter that the ceilings initiated by this Government are not working.

* People who are dependent on social **security** are not being given the service that they require from the Government because the Government has initiated ceilings which do not allow public servants to carry out their duties to the people of this country.

* Has the Government expressed that view to members of the **Security** Council, in particular to our ally, the United States?

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* As money has been made available to destitute and needy university students, has the Minister considered the possibility of making grants or loans available to local councils or to regional social **security** centres to enable emergency relief to be given to destitute people?

* The Oppostion supports these amendments to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act, which was originally introduced by the former Government to provide teachers for the Commonwealth schools in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and also, we would hopefully believe, to provide **security** for Australian teachers in Papua New Guinea who might thereby be encouraged to stay in those Territories knowing that they would have **security** in being able to come back to the Commonwealth Teaching Service .

* We want **security**.

* We want **security** above all else.

* Over the last 30 years the people of Australia have become accustomed to job **security**.

* The right honourable gentleman, his right honourable colleagues, his honourable colleagues and those serfs on the back benches who do not have any of those titles, continue to assert that high wages in Australia are part of the threat to the continuance of our economic **security**.

* The unanswered questions to which 1 have referred relate not only to the fundamentals of why the Attorney-General visited the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in Canberra but also to the very exercise of his ministerial responsibilities.

* There is also the motive of the left wing of the Government Party in its whole attack on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The Department of Social **Security** should be required to deduct income tax from pensions and unemployment benefits when they are taxable instead of the present procedure of simply deducting tax when requested.

* It is incorrect that different values are set for a government department, in this case the Department of Social **Security**, and individual employers.

* Is it also a fact that small companies requiring funds to cover the effects of inflation, and attempting to borrow from a bank, such as the ANZ Banking Group, are required to provide first mortgage **security** over personal assets such as the homes of their directors, whilst the same bank grants multi-million dollar loans to individuals wishing to strip public companies of assets for personal gain, these large loans being secured against the shares in the public companies concerned.

* One of those terms is that reasonable **security** of earnings be assured to the labourer.

* What the judge of the Arbitration Commission was saying is that **security** of employment is basic to the rights of employees and that to abrogate those rights by obtaining stand-down clauses there must be very substantial grounds indeed and the Arbitration Commission must be persuaded by argument that that is the case.

* I refer the right honourable gentleman to the statement made by the Minister for Social **Security** on 28 August 1975 when tabling the first main report of the Poverty Inquiry (Senate  Hansard  28 August 1975, pages 362-3).

* Asmentioned by the Minister, Professor Henderson's report will be one of the major documents to be considered by the Income **Security** Review, the terms of reference of which I announced on 8 September 1975.

* The Homeless Persons Assistance Act 1 974 is administered by the Department of Social **Security** and makes available financial assistance to eligible organisations to provide temporary accommodation, meals and personal services for homeless men and women.

* No formal applications have been lodged with the Department of Social **Security**.

* It was established within the city of Coburg and was designed to bring together the full range of welfare services- the services of the Federal Department of Social **Security**, the services of the State Department of Social Welfare and the services provided by some of the voluntary agencies in that area.

* Quite recently I discovered that the Department of Social **Security** has a Northcote office, with something like 50 members of staff, which is currently located in the main government offices in Spring Street in the centre of Melbourne.

* My proposition is simply that the Government should consider the establishment in the city of Northcote of a Commonwealth Government centre which brings together the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security**, possibly in some type of working relationship with welfare services provided by the Northcote Municipal Council and some of the voluntary agencies which exist in that city.

* I believe that currently there is such a close relationship between the operations of the Department of Social **Security** and the Commonwealth Employment Service that considerable gains could be achieved for the people who want to use that centre.

* It knows also that the city of Bundaberg and surrounding towns depend greatly on the stability and **security** of the sugar industry.

* We find that the rural community in the electorate is seeing that the basic objective is to give greater **security** and greater price stability, particularly for those products which largely depend on export markets.

* A few moments ago the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was good enough to mention me as the preceding Minister and asked why we had taken no action in regard to certain problems of the inmates of nursing homes.

* Mr HAYDEN (Oxley- Minister for Social **Security**) - I wish to make a personal explanation.

* Continuous watching during the silent hours including gate **security** and area patrols.

* One would expect that even the Labor Party would understand that the national **security** is paramount and that one has to have a sufficient defence capacity if one is to have national **security**.

* The first is **security**.

* He said in the Senate last year that again the red herring of **security** was being used to try to justify irresponsible public expenditure.

* The Prime Minister himself told the House of Representatives in March 1976 that 'the argument that Qantas cannot provide adequate **security** for a Prime Minister is a specious argument and false'.

* Assessment of eligibility under the subsidised health benefits plan and the issue of SHB entitlement certificates are carried out by the Department of Social **Security**, not the Department of Health, in respect of all these groups with the exception of migrants whose certificates are issued by the Department of Immigration.

* The $1.3m cost of administering the subsidised health benefits plan is met by the Department of Social **Security** which carries out assessments of the beneficiaries and issues the SHB certificates.

* The amount of $ 1.3m would be sufficiently accurate as these costs can be identified with the Department of Social **Security**.

* The answer to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question is that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation does have a lawful function to perform in the Territory, as one would expect, because it is within its charter.

* Of course the Government has adorned the Governor-General's Speech with the old familiar phrases - 'protection for the weaker section of the community', welfare housing will be provided 'as soon as circumstances permit', the next Budget will make further increases in social **security**, and it will also provide for increased assistance for the handicapped and disabled.

* I would not like to express an opinion at this notice on the position of the DirectorGeneral of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* We give an undertaking to the aged people and to those who are seeking accommodation in hostels, in nursing homes, or wherever they might be, that we will achieve an economic stability that will ensure them the **security** that they have not had in the last 18 months.

* Acceptance by SWAPO of the composition of UNTAG is particularly relevant to both the safety and **security** of Australian and other personnel deployed in Namibia.

* When the **Security** Council will be able to meet to discuss final arrangements is not yet clear.

* I shall therefore refer the substance of his question to my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**, in the course of the afternoon.

* However, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  a Press statement and also a determination that was made by  Mr Daniels,  the Director-General of Social **Security** on 27 May 1977, which may be of interest to honourable members.

* On page 10 of the printed copy of his Speech the Governor-General refers to strengthening defence and **security**.

* He said: 
My Government will continue to work for international stability and **security**, and to maintain an appropriate and substantial capacity to defend Australia.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What non-metropolitan cities and towns have a Department of Social **Security** office.

* Does the Minister then believe that the Government's views on defence and internal **security** are substantially similar to.

* This is because he has already told us this morning that its members were concerned principally with matters of Australian defence and internal **security** and had personal policies on these matters substantially similar to those of the Government.

* If not, will he inform the House what measures are being taken to remedy the allegedly inadequate **security** within the Department ofDefence?

* Is it a fact that  Mr Thwaites  formerly served with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation?

* Is it a fact that you have received, or have you received, complaints from the Australian Labor Party suggesting that because a man has served with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation he is unacceptable to the Labor Party?

* Will the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** inform the House as to what progress has been made towards achieving a reciprocal social **security** agreement with West Germany particularly as the absence of such an agreement disqualifies former residents of Germany who are now Australian citizens from receiving West German pensions and, as a consequence, imposes an unnecessary burden upon Australian taxpayers?

* -The Opposition has raised this matter of public importance because it believes that the Australian community as a whole has been lulled into a false sense of **security** by the discussion paper on paying for health care which was presented in this House on, I think, 15 March.

* On all the evidence of the operation of the social **security** network in this country the Government has demonstrated its practical concern by a rigid and unthinking adherence to an unemployment benefit system the concept and basic intent of which has been unaltered since 1947, a system condemned or severely criticised by nearly every major governmental report bearing on the system in recent years.

* Responsibility for the problems in these cases lies not with the individuals but within the administration of social **security**.

* We need to increase the staff in the Department of Social **Security**.

* I think it is important that the payment of unemployment benefits result from a positive generation of the cheque in the Department of Social **Security** and not in the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* I think we should divorce the CES and the Department of Social **Security** more clearly from each other in these tasks so that one can be an employment agency and the other can deal with the social **security** problem.

* Even in the simplest way we need to think about the accommodation in our social **security** offices.

* I assure the House that I firmly believe that this legislation, particularly the Bill relating to nursing homes, ushers in a new era of **security** to nursing home patients and to the aged and sick aged who have to seek refuge in nursing homes throughout Australia.

* It is not a question of caving in but if it is a question of trying to give a sense of **security**, which I hope honourable members opposite would like to see, to people who are sick or aged in nursing homes around Australia, yes, we will give consideration to it and if it is possible we will see that it is done.

* But if it is hostel accommodation in a social **security** sense, that would be a matter for the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* They will receive far greater benefits from the Government or from the fund and therefore will receive much greater **security**.

* I again give an assurance to the House and to nursing nome patients that there is a clear intention on the part of the Government to bring about a new sense of **security** to nursing home patients and to their families throughout Australia as a result of the amendments which we have made.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security**: In his constructive and humanitarian consideration of social **security** benefits, will he give special consideration to needy people living in remote places who are denied the advantages of trained nursing services?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The honourable member is suggesting the predecessors of the present Prime Minister were equally discourteous.

* First of all, of course, he has something to do with tha Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* **Security** in chemist shops is another matter that is causing us great worry.

* When one looks at the **security** arrangements that exist in most pharmacies in Australia one has cause to feel concern.

* I think that your attention was temporarily diverted,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  because the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who was at the table was seeking to make a personal explanation and in those circumstances you did not hear our call for a division.

* There ought to be no need to tell this House of the kind of injustices that can be visited upon citizens as a result of the secret **security** service.

* As the honourable member for Lilley said today, the recommendations of the **security** service are not executive instruments, but many of its recommendations to departments and Ministers have the force of administrative power.

* Hundreds of people have had their naturalisation suspended, held up or denied because of reports from faceless people in the **security** service.

* I could quote more from that Press release as it is relevant to this whole matter of giving aid to under-developed countries which is under discussion in this debate but I shall merely draw attention to how so many prominent people in Australia are behind the actions of any government in improving aid- not only the amount of aid but the form of aid- being given to underdeveloped countries which is so important for peace as well as economic **security** in our world.

* -This matter comes within the responsibility of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* He will be reporting back to the Minister for Social **Security** and the Government and an announcement will be made some time in the next day or so.

* Before the end of May last year the Ministers for Employment and Industrial Relations, Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and Social **Security** had discussions on the problems of Aboriginal employment, including the impact of unemployment benefit payments on Aboriginal communities.

* An essential rationale behind such a policy recognised that Australian transportation must have **security** of supply of petroleum products.

* Let me comment on one particular category of Budget expenditure, namely, social **security** and welfare.

* The Monkami Centre to which I referred presently has an application with the Department of Social **Security** for a subsidy for the construction of further hostel accommodation which is very much needed in the area.

* I want to move from the subject of social **security** to the subject of defence.

* John Ryan describes it as starting its proceedings with the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary - and there were members of the **security** branch sitting in the audience.

* The members of the **security** branch, for all I know, may have been interested as private citizens.

* The reaction of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was to say that these attitudes had been based on a campaign of misrepresentation.

* This is even more true if we consider the record of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** over the last 5 years.

* Faced with this position and with the ground cut from under their feet the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** decided to bluff it out and to misrepresent and misrepresent and misrepresent again.

* The Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** have said again and again that their scheme does not mean nationalisation.

* The inclusion of the photograph of the Minister for Social **Security** was requested by the Department of Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 November 1978: 
-by leave-On 21 August 1974 the previous Government established a Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** and appointed the Honourable  Mr Justice  Hope as the royal commissioner to inquire into and make recommendations on the intelligence and **security** services the nation should have available to it.

* 1 ) Is it a fact as suggested by representatives of the Attorney-General's Department to the Law Council of Australia on 9 October 1979, that regardless of any suggestions which the Administrative Review Council may make, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is to be given certain decisions of the Director-General of Social **Security** which are adverse to claimants for social **security** benefits.

* -by leave-As these new measures announced by the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  on behalf of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  improve benefits for social beneficiaries they receive the support of the Opposition.

* Obviously this does not apply only to the question of social **security**.

* Therefore, all social **security** recipients who were covered by indexation in fact lost out on one indexation stage.

* Last year when the Government took its decision to introduce annual indexation adjustments of social **security** and repatriation pensions and benefits, it was with the prospect of a lower rate of inflation than now prevails.

* I appeal to the Government- I know that it has had many representations, not only from individuals and from our side of the House but also from The Pharmacy Guild of Australia- to try to do something for recipients of social **security** benefits who are not able to get pensioner health benefit cards and are therefore unable to get free pharmaceuticals.

* This Government and people connected with social **security** and employment creation schemes are continuously talking about getting jobs for the young unemployed.

* In view of the apparent lack of **security** at the Williamstown Dockyard and other naval establish ments, which has been mentioned by the Minister, and the fact that new naval ships are under discussion, why does not the Government make a clean sweep of personnel at the Dockyard and employ men who are not **security** risks?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) An accurate figure is not available.

* As at 3 1 December 1976 the Department of Social **Security** was paying special benefit to some 553 persons who did not qualify for a pension, because they lacked residence qualifications.

* In addition, 'on duty ' staff were transferred on a voluntary basis from Departments (such as the Postmaster-General's Department and the Department of Social **Security**) in other States to perform a wide range of tasks associated with flood restoration and rehabilitation.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.'

* Secondly, I appeal to them on the third ground of our amendment, that is, that this Budget produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.

* Thus, we have a Budget that provides nothing even in the short term that could be construed as a programme for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.

* They have a stable government, an improving economy and large **security** forces.

* The Council reaffirmed that the responsibility to maintain peace and **security** in this crucial area rests on all free nations in the Asian and Pacific region and strongly recommended that any proposed reduction of United States or United Nations defence forces be so planned and executed as not to impair regional or national defence capabilities of free Asia and such steps be taken only with prior consultation with the governments concerned.

* I and other members put specific questions to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  during the course of the debate.

* I ask the Minister for Tourism and Recreation  (Mr Stewart),  because of the absence of the Minister for Social **Security**, when we will receive answers to these questions?

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the editorial in the Sydney 'Daily Telegraph' of the 19th instant claiming that 65 000 people were receiving social **security** hand-outs to which they were not entitled and that those people had been obtaining money by false pretences?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* and (b) The estimated cost of increasing the free area of income allowed to single social **security** pensioners by $ 10 a week (i.e.

* Social **security** payments have been indexed and tied to the consumer price index.

* I realise that the facilities of the Department of Social **Security** are made available to people for rehabilitation, but I think the Department should go a bit further.

* I remember asking a question on this matter of the Minister for Health, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, when the session started, because I was personally involved with a number of people on long term compensation.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Has the Department of Social **Security** yet decided to authorise a grant to purchase a new school bus for the Special School for Handicapped Children.

* When speaking to the Bill he expressed the then conservative Government's fear of the financial implications of free social **security** and its wish to preserve the dignity and the self-respect of the recipient of benefits by having him contribute financially towards the scheme.

* We have all been shocked by recent court cases, not only those in the social **security** area but also those in other areas, in which doctors have been shown to be making fraudulent returns.

* I think that we could be far more constructive in helping those countries and in helping our own interests - in our own **security**.

* In our own **security** we could be carrying out a peace offensive to help these countries.

* Unemployment appears likely to increase in the near future and the Commonwealth Government will incur a heavier liability for payments by its Department of Social **Security**.

* Does the **security** check to which he has referred relate to the past financial propriety of present members of ministerial staff?

* Does the **security** check examine the financial propriety of the persons under check?

* The Minister for Social **Security** indicated in another place on Tuesday that discussions on the matters raised in the honourable gentleman's question, were to be held yesterday between the ACOA and the Public Service Board and senior officers from the Department of Social **Security**.

* These are some of the requirements: The applicant must not be adversely regarded from a **security** point of view; he must be of good character; he must have ample funds for his stay in the Territory and for his return or onward journey.

* -I ask the Minister for Health: Is the Government concerned about allegations of people fraudulently obtaining social **security** and unemployment benefits?

* Has the Government taken those allegations seriously and is any action being taken to investigate ways and means of protecting taxpayers generally from abuses of the social **security** system?

* I spoke only a week back to the former Minister for Social **Security** in Britain, the Right Honourable Stan Orme.

* I refer to  Mr D.  A. Harragan, formerly of the Department of Social **Security**, now employed by Facom Australia Limited.

* In addition, five officers- two from the Public Service Board, two from the Department of Social **Security**, and one from the Department of Health assisted the evaluation effort on a part-time basis.

* It was attended by  Sir Arthur  Tange, Secretary, Department of Defence;  Mr R.  W. Cole, Secretary, Department of Finance;  Mr S.  Burton,  Deputy  Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade;  Dr R.  J. Cameron, Australian Statistician;  Mr P.  J. Lanigan, Director-General, Department of Social **Security**; and  Mr G.  J. Yeend, Acting Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

* The facts of this statement have been checked with all relevant permanent heads- namely, the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board, the permanent heads of the departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Trade and Resources, Defence, Administrative Services, Social **Security** and Finance, and the Australian Statistician.

* His Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  has raped the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation on which this country depends for internal **security**.

* The Director-General of **Security** not only made no oral complaint to me when he called the day after the police visit to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Melbourne but on the contrary said that he had not come to complain about the Attorney-General.

* It would be a very proper thing for this Parliament now to see that such basic financial institutions as building societies are equated much more in their operations to banks - that is, we should guarantee their **security** and in return they should pursue the public interest in their lending policies.

* I can only assume that this means that any person who has a **security**, equity, lien, mortgage or whatever it might be on the wool is in fact, under the definition, the legal producer of the wool.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
1 ) How many copies of ( a ) each daily newspaper and ( b ) each weekly publication are purchased by (i) the Head Office and (ii) other offices of the Depanment of Social **Security**.

* I will certainly convey the question and the concern of the honourable member to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* No doubt she will examine this matter in the course of her consideration of the Department of Social **Security** estimates during Cabinet Budget discussions.

* From the Opposition's point of view we are concerned about the maintenance of Australian **security**.

* We are worried about the degree to which Labor has let Australia's **security** run down in its inability to maintain a reasonable forward re-equipment program.

* This is an area of immediate and vital importance to the **security** and maintenance of our way of life.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Did the Director-General of **Security** in the telex which he says he drafted and issued to the ASIO staff use the words 'unprecedented', 'extraordinary' and 'gravely damaging to ASIO and to the national **security** interests'?

* Debates on defence in this House are rarely centred on the defence of Australia or national **security**.

* Firstly, it must satisfy national **security**.

* But let us look at national **security**.

* 1 ) Invitations for the official opening of the regional office of the Department of Social **Security** at Rockingham, Western Australia, on 13 September 1974 were issued by the Director of Social **Security** in Western Australia.

* As the poultry industry uses 80 per cent wheat in its feeding program and as this increase could force many small producers out of business, will the Minister consider some form of Commonwealth assistance including the setting up urgently of a Commonwealth poultry industry stabilisation fund to give some **security** to this turbulent industry?

* I have been advised by the Minister for Social **Security** that her Department has no plans to publish a separate directory of support services for women.

* The Department of Social **Security** produces numerous leaflets for the public on the services it provides.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 November.

* were based, rather, on the unreasoned assumption that any person who thought or acted less conservatively than suited the **security** force were likely to be potential dangers to the **security** of the nation.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I think that is the answer to allegations of dole bludging and it gives a fair example of what we are doing to the young people in the community by depressing the economy.

* In the meantime she applied for a social **security** benefit and such is the encouragement given to her that this Government told her that because she spent a day at technical college during the week she was not eligible for a social **security** benefit.

* The fundamental aim of the complex would be to care for each patient in accordance with individual needs while maintaining personal dignity and sense of identity, independence, involvement with and contribution to society and **security**, freedom from fear and loneliness.

* The office of Director of **Security** constituted under the Principal Act as amended by this Act shall, for all purposes, be deemed to be the same office as the office of DirectorGeneral of **Security** constituted under the Principal Act.

* They say inside and outside this House that they are interested in defence, but by their very words they are condemned as a party which is prepared to sacrifice the defence **security** of Australia.

* It is rather one aspect, an important aspect, of the effort expended in this country with regard to long term national **security** by seeking to maintain effective defence forces on a permanent, continuing basis, in particular by enabling the maintenance of an army of a size consistent with a permanent and continuing defence capability.

* The major component of the manpower necessary to achieve national **security** objectives, of course, is obtained by volunteer recruitment.

* When I was Minister for Social **Security** there were, as there perennially are, problems with the media about unemployment benefits.

* I always treated it as such, although I know that several former members of a Ministry in a previous government would contact Treasury or the Department of Social **Security** in the course of a week.

* As to the term, I personally believe that it was fundamental that we had long-term **security**.

* To admit Taiwan to the United Nations it will be necessary to secure a two-thirds vote in the General Assembly as well as the sanction of the **Security** Council.

* If the People's Republic of China were admitted first as a member of the **Security** Council, it would veto the entry of Taiwan.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 November 1978: 
Did the Department of Social **Security** make a submission to the Review of Australia's International Civil Aviation Policy.

* **Security** at key telephone exchanges is regularly reviewed and following a recent survey of the Barton exchange a number of additional **security** measures have been taken.

* I will draw the attention of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to the statement made by the honourable member.

* The Minister for Administrative Services believes on **security** advice that the Government does need available to it **security** cars for VIP visitors from overseas or for special circumstances in Australia if that is necessary.

* It has however signed a voluntary safeguards agreement with the IAEA to provide for safeguards on its facilities 'not of national **security** interest'.

* Provisions ensuring that adequate physical **security** will be maintained, to guard against theft or other illegal use of nuclear material by groups or individuals.

* Who rules in Saigon is not and never has been an ingredient in Australia's **security**.

* Our strength, our **security** rests on factors and relationships ultimately unchanged by these events.

* **Security** and Minister for Repatriation and Compensation.

* The scheme proposed in the Bill, I concede, does provide a basis of professional **security** for a group of teachers who will serve under various Commonwealth educational authorities and for other teachers who will be on loan from the Commonwealth to the States and other Territories, and indeed, to other countries.

* Fourthly, it aims to make a flexible teaching service, backed by professional **security**, available to not only Commonwealth areas of responsibility but also our neighbours in the Pacific region.

* Figures published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development earlier this year show that payments by employees in the form of income tax and social **security** contributions as a percentage of gross national product was lower in Australia than in all but seven of the 22 OECD countries.

* The proportion of gross national product derived from employee social **security** contributions and income tax was 10 per cent in Australia in 1972.

* His program, in order to have any semblance of economic responsibility, would have to tear the heart out of the Government's education, welfare, health and urban development and recreation programs that are designed to provide equality of opportunity, income **security**, good health and a more pleasant environment for all.

* They can afford to pay for the best schools, the best health care and the best urban environment and have no need of income **security** programs.

* Above all else, it is the Government's responsibility to see that people in this country live in **security** and peace and are not disturbed by this menace of which I have spoken so often.

* By failing to adopt this approach, the Government has in many ways opted out of its real responsibilities to give us a co-ordinated approach to industry, to manpower problems, to job **security**, to location of industries, and to migration and education- all elements of policy that ought to be taken into account when one talks of the future of our industries and the future **security** and lives of our working people.

* was an application received recently from an ex-New South Wales constable of police who was well qualified and had no blemish whatsoever on his character, and at the time of his application was working for a **security** organisation.

* Towards the end of last year  Sir George  Godber who is the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social **Security** in a letter appearing in the British 'Medical Journal' complained that there has been selective and incomplete quoting from his report on maternal deaths.

* He wrote: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 November 1978: 
1 ) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the extremely crowded conditions under which employees of the Department of Social **Security** are required to work at the Whyalla SA, office of the Department of Social **Security**.

* What has him rather concerned, no doubt  Mr Speaker,  is that those numbers tell the Australian nation a very clear story, that is, that if the policy of the Australian Labor Party is put into effect the **security** of this country will be put very much at stake.

* I make one other point while I am oil my feet, that is, that not only is this a .matter of the **security** of this country; there will be an additional reservoir of unemployment should the policy of the Opposition be put into effect.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 1 September 1979: 
1 ) For what period was the Department of Social **Security** regional office situated at the Northland Shopping Complex, Victoria.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I interviewed some of the people who had arrived.

* As they put it, they had been taken by the Vietnamese **security** forceswhatever that may mean- in trucks from South Vietnam up to Haiphong harbour in North Vietnam.

* They were put on boats with petrol, food, et cetera and taken out to sea by **security** forces, as they again put it, and pointed in the direction of Hong Kong.

* -Has the Minister for Social **Security** seen Press reports lately of statements by major private health insurance organisations defending their recent fee increases?

* The old-age **security** pension (but not the guaranteed income supplement) would be payable to persons residing in Australia who hadlived in Canada for 10 years immediately prior to being granted pension and had lived there for a total of 25 years after the age of 21.

* At question time today I directed a question to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  concerning two points.

* But this morning at question time the Minister for Social **Security** refused to answer that question.

* -I ask the Minister for Social **Security** whether he has given any consideration to the present plight of committees of management of homes for the aged or institutions which are in the process of building home units for the aged.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Will all tested pensions and benefits administered by the Department of Social **Security** be subject only to the simple income test after that date.

* It was one of these advisers - being paid, I am told, nearly $1,000 a week - who led the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  into his blundering raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  have visions of desirable changes in our society, which the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  immediately frustrate by destroying the future growth in productivity which alone could make these social objectives possible.

* In the city of Ipswich, which is in the electorate of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  complete uproar recently occurred with petitions being presented to the council calling on the council to resign and for rates to be reduced.

* In Australia we have a totally inadequate debt **security** or mortgage market.

* That is a remarkable and wonderful **security** for the beef industry.

* We placed a good deal of emphasis on the industry because it was in a tremendously desperate situation and needed some form of **security** for the future.

* Although these are big increases - I think they are deserved increases and I do not complain about them - they are still not quite as good as the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  would have us believe.

* In recent months, it is true, that plan has gone forward, but owing to the administrative difficulties of the Government - I would say almost the administrative clumsiness of the Minister for Social **Security** - for a year it practically stood still and stagnant.

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I refer the Minister to a Social **Security** pamphlet dated November 1975 which states: 'People over 70 years of age may receive the pension free of means test'.

* I also refer the Minister to statements appearing in the Melbourne newspapers of 20 March last and attributed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* As this statement has created a lot of confusion amongst this age group, will the Minister for Health consult with the Minister for Social **Security** with a view to making a further statement and so clear the air on this all-important question as to whether a pension free of means test is available at 69 years or 70 years of age?

* Is he aware of the statement made yesterday by his colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**, that the Government was presiding over the destruction of the Australian economy?

* Is the Prime Minister further aware - 
In compliance with Australia's obligation under the United Nations **Security** Council resolutions, successive Australian Governments have adhered to a policy of refraining from all official dealings with the Rhodesian regime.

* This does not mean, however, that backbench members of any party in the Parliament, acting in their personal capacity, should not visit Southern Rhodesia to gain information on the situation there; 
1 ) What proportion of total personal income, including employers' workers' compensation contributions, was taken by (a) taxes on incomes and (b) social **security** contributions in(i) 1974-75 and(ii) 1975-76.

* What proportion of gross domestic product was (a) social **security** spending, (b) health expenditure and (c) educational expenditure, in all cases by all levels of government, during (i) 1974-75 and(ii) 1975-76.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The basic rates of social **security** pensions and benefits are adjusted in accordance with movements in the consumer price index.

* The question of the appropriate method of adjusting social **security** pensions, benefits and allowances will be considered by the Income **Security** Review as part of the review of the income **security** system as a whole.

* The honourable member asked whether the large increase in government **security** holdings by these institutions means that the trading banks as providers of credit have lost their audacity'.

* That is a nice **security** blanket for them; the theory is that all they have to do is wait for the Government to finish tearing around and implementing a lot of policies and then come back in.

* It became a notable contributor to conferences such as those on world food problems, population, humanitarian law in armed conflict, and **security** and co-operation in Europe.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* One thing that shone through his speech was the fact that he did make an endeavour to divide the things which the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  is proposing from those which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is proposing.

* One cannot help but feel that the Opposition is acting like a group of King Canutes trying to stop the tide, trying to stop the inevitable simply by trying to divide a comprehensive plan for health and social **security** up into a number of groups.

* It stated: 
Opposition spokesman on Social **Security**, Health and Welfare.

* There are many powers which the Government has under the Constitution but the Opposition often adopts a different attitude to the exercise of power by governments even in situations which demand it, such as in relation to **security** matters involving the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* **Security** measures which have been taken and which will continue to be taken are those assessed as appropriate in the circumstances by officials responsible for **security** matters.

* Once voluntarism is abolished the system is able to be adjusted with proper **security** and equity.

* This is a matter which I know the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  is very much aware of and is concerned about.

* I will ask the Minister for Social **Security** to provide him with the answer to that matter.

* The ACTU  president, Mr Hawke,  said today social **security** payments needed to be more strictly policed.

* I would have thought that the condolence motion which this House passed today regarding the death of the late Lord Louis Mountbatten at the hands of a terrorist assassin is proof enough of the need for this country to see that its Prime Minister, whether he is from the Labor, Liberal or any other political party, is provided with proper **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-The Australian Federal Police Bill represents just one more about-face by this Government from the time when the coalition parties were in opposition.

* The fact that  Sir Robert  Mark was appointed to inquire into the allocation of police resources in the Commonwealth area was an admission by the Government of the inadequacy of the **security** arrangements for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Sydney in February 1978.

* The members of the protective services component will, in the main, be involved in static guard duty at Commonwealth places of low **security** risks.

* As we have pointed out in relation to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization and Customs legislation, there can be no real ministerial accountability unless there is disclosure.

* In addition, notes which were short term securities- usually for a maximum term of six months- were available to financial institutions seeking to park funds for a short period with absolute **security** and reasonable facility of ready conversion to cash.

* Surely Labor speakers who have no direct or personal financial interest, such as several Government supporters have, are to be commended even more - if we use the Assistant Minister's argument - for their genuine desire to gain a better deal and a guaranteed **security** for wool growers and farmers alike, than Government members are to be commended who themselves stand to gain from the legislation.

* The extension of the deficiency payments scheme for a further 12 months will provide wool growers with a sense of **security** and should enhance confidence in the future of the industry.

* I find it hard to accept that 36c will give the grower any sense of **security** or confidence, when in 1969-70 the average price was 37.55c and growers at that time certainly were feeling far from secure.

* The fact is that subsidies can never give any real sense of **security** or confidence.

* When we are the government after 2nd December we will take immediate steps to bring about the situation for which the wool growers are looking, to protect their rights and to give them a feeling of real **security** instead of the uncertainty which the present Government's policy fosters.

* Did a Government spokesman later say that the right honourable gentleman had given the document a very high **security** classification and that no further details could be divulged?

* What **security** classification has the Prime Minister given to the communication?

* Before I deal with employment, I want to refer to the way in which the Department of Social **Security** is dealing with unemployed people in terms of the work test and the payment of unemployment benefit.

* The letter which is now sent out to unemployed people states: 
I would be delighted to know how many unemployed people carry around a Diners Club card or an American Express card so that they can be identified by the Department of Social **Security**.

* This crude letter is sent out by the Department of Social **Security** to unemployed people.

* The Minister for Social **Security** keeps me very well informed in case I receive a question such as this.

* I am informed by the Minister for Social **Security** that the practice of monitoring the decisions of the tribunals will continue, as far as resources are available, in order to ascertain any reasons for quite large discrepancies between the States.

* It is a very good question and I can assure the honourable member that the Minister for Social **Security** is watching the situation carefully.

* Because of the **security** provisions of the Act, workers can be denied full information on the materials handled and the dangers involved, as well as the results of health checks.

* During his absence, the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  is Acting Treasurer.

* The practice has grown in Australia of home ownership and the myth of the **security** that home ownership allegedly brings has been fostered by successive Liberal-Country Party governments.

* Rather do I believe that the search is for **security** of tenure.

* I believe this is what people seek more than ownership - the **security** of tenure.

* Firstly, I refer to Labor's program of helping young people to get their first foot on the ladder in the context of a broad response to the problems facing people on low incomes in terms of basic housing **security**- the problems that are getting worse every day.

* For all these thousands of people whose housing **security** is threatened there is an urgent need for an expansion of the provision of public rental housing in this country to provide secure accommodation.

* That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* We are constantly being criticised on our social **security** and welfare policies.

* Yet within the context of overall economic responsibility the Commonwealth Government has continued to give high priority to income **security** and social welfare needs.

* Total spending on social **security** and welfare will increase by 9.6 per cent to $8,900m in 1979-80.

* The more affluent white person, to use the popular parlance of sociologists, is future orientated; that is to say, he directs his activities to future comfort and **security**.

* He stays at school longer; he improves his educational status in the interests of peronal **security**; he may take out life assurance; he saves his money to secure his family, and so on.

* But for those dispossessed either voluntarily or involuntarily from the land- 
-Can the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** tell the House whether the Minister for Social **Security** has directed the Director of the Department of Social **Security** in Victoria not to make special benefit or unemployment benefit payments to people who have been refused work by employers because of electricity restrictions?

* (b) Applications for Australian citizenship refused on **security** grounds: 
The Prime Minister has just said - these may not be his exact words but I do not think that he will quarrel with the meaning of them - that in the early days of his Government he authorised and directed the.

* At the time he made the request or gave the direction did he have any confidence in the standing of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation?

* Finally, has there been any reduction in the provision of **security** intelligence information to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation since these unprecedented actions occurred?

* I would say, however, that there is a **security** organisation in Australia which has a responsibility to report to the Government any matters which, within the statutory charter of that organisation, ought to be reported to it.

* Nevertheless, Australia welcomed the U.S. proposal as a contribution to further discussion and clarification of the issues involved in ensuring greater world food **security**.

* The Australian delegation to the January meeting of the Preparatory Group put Australia's view that world food **security** could be best assured by a package of measures which would ensure the availability of stocks and the flow of supplies to world markets, and suggested that any agreement would need to provide a balance of benefits for both producers and consumers by dealing with both shortage and surplus situations.

* The Australian delegation argued that to the extent that the concept of world food **security** involves ensuring that adequate production is forthcoming.

* People invest in blue chip stocks and blue chip organisations for reasons of **security** and return - modest return with reasonable **security**.

* Thus it is pleasing to see that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is carrying out a national survey in this matter.

* Did the Prime Minister authorise  Senator Murphy's  raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Unfortunately the big powers claimed that they would guarantee the Israeli **security** and safeguard her right to free passage through the Suez Canal and into the Indian Ocean.

* Both the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the previous Prime Minister were given the strongest advice on **security** grounds that when travelling overseas they should be in special purpose aircraft- either those owned by the Royal Australian Air Force or by Qantas Airways Ltd. Having in mind the general **security** situation which we see internationally today, it would be of the utmost stupidity for any Australian Prime Minister, regardless of his party, to travel overseas on an aircraft with 300-odd other passengers and put their lives in jeopardy because of his presence, and that of his party, on the aircraft.

* The health or **security** of other passengers on board does not matter!

* Other documents have been published recently in the newspapers, some of them **security** documents.

* Is it true that the Prime Minister and this Government do not follow any system of **security** clearance for the staff of Ministers?

* Will the Prime Minister assure the House that, in the future, **security** checks will be followed with respect to staff appointed to this Parliament so that all those other worthwhile members of staff can be cleared?

* Will the Prime Minister assure the House that if there are unusual circumstances surrounding any particular member of staff, perhaps that matter might be referred to the Royal Commission now inquiring into **security** and to which he has appointed  His  Honour,  Mr Justice  Hope, currently to inquire?

* However at times the situation in our dockyards where we are hoping the destroyer will be built - this is a decision yet to be made by the Government - is far from desirable in terms of **security**.

* I would think that this was an acceptable means of reasonable **security** in any establishment of this kind.

* To my mind this again is an unacceptable **security** risk.

* However, the trends in this Bill, together with statements made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  are leading us towards the welfare state and do concern the Australian Country Party.

* The Country Party is further concerned with the implications of Labor's social **security** programme on the total economy in the long term.

* Members of the Australian Country Party are concerned at the octopus-like growth of the Department of Social **Security**.

* In the comparatively short space of 3 months the Minister for Health has seen his Department decimated by the power hungry Minister for Social **Security**.

* And the Minister for Social **Security** has only just started.

* The expansion of the responsibilities, authority and expenditure of the Department of Social **Security** is one of the worst examples pf ruthless empire building.

* 1 understand that hundreds of public servants have had to transfer from the Department of Health to the Department of Social **Security**.

* This Bill, and other statements by this free spending empire building Minister for Social **Security**, clearly illustrate the basic differences in national philosophy between the Country Party and the Labor Government.

* However, the financial payments available to single unemployed persons in particular, together with the recent instructions from the Minister for Social **Security**, appear to provide a dangerous incentive for them not to work.

* It is the opinion of many people that this Labor Government, and particularly the Minister for Social **Security**, will prove to be a taxpayers' nightmare.

* This is a sort of neurotic, obsessive and paranoidal predisposition to some type of concept of **security** which led them to brand everything as requiring top **security**.

* He detailed how bases in the central part of Australia could not justify the extreme status to which they had been elevated in **security** classification to the point where it seems - one clearly interprets this from the statement of the Minister for Defence - that the current Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  had not been aware of the basis on which these bases operated and had to wait until this Government was appointed before he could receive his first briefing on their purposes.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* In effect, a clear break was made with the past and a system was introduced whereby all social **security** payments are in fact met from the CRF even though moneys are channelled through the NWF trust account.

* Since 1952 social **security** payments financed from the general revenue of the CRF have amounted to many thousands of millions of dollars.

* Given the standing appropriation provisions for automatic replenishment of all amounts paid from the National Welfare Fund for social **security**, the balance of the Fund, of course, has been continually replenished.

* The example set in the presentation of the accounts of Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is frankly not good enough.

* Peace and **security** do not come simply because we wish them to come.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* (1), (2) and (3) The Department of Social **Security** does not keep separate statistics of the persons who have had their benefits terminated on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* relation to appeals to the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunals and of the decisions given by those tribunals m favour of the appellants, no separate record has been kept of the number of cases which arose out of CES decisions.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
In accordance with one of the recommendations of the 1973 Working Party that the program should be reviewed after three years, the major provisions of the Act relating to capital and rental grants are operative until 13 December 1977.

* In his second reading speech the then Minister for Social **Security** said that the purpose of making the legislation subject to a three-year 'prescribed period' was to ensure that the scope, value and standards of the services provided would be monitored and an assessment of the total program made prior to the expiration of the first three years of its operation.

* In accordance with this intention, a review of the operation of the Act has been carried out by the Department of Social **Security**, based on an analysis of a national sample survey of the views expressed by homeless persons and by the agencies caring for them.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has also received submissions from the Advisory Committees on Homeless Persons set up in each State to advise the Minister on matters relating to the administration of the Act.

* Buying a house is compulsory saving, and if there is one thing in this community that a family should have it is **security** in some form.

* Should the death of the breadwinner unfortunately happen, a death benefit insurance scheme provides **security** for the family of an eligible participant by providing payments for all outstanding loan money and this, of course, is a marvellous thing, because even a week after a tenant has decided to buy his home and the necessary documents have been finalised, should the breadwinner die then the wife and family become the owner of the home entirely unencumbered.

* What magnificant **security** this is for people of low income!

* Why should the present Government push such a philosophy on a Liberal government which has seen a policy bloom into such remarkable success in Victoria where 33,832 home owners, all needy people, are at last assured of some **security** as far as their wives and family are concerned?

* Affairs and not from the Department of Social **Security** or the Department of Education, as other Australians may, simply because they are termed new Australians?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-Those remarks of the honourable member for Denison are absolutely accurate.

* More specifically, as Minister for Social **Security**, he initiated massive increases in health and welfare expenditure which the nation could illafford.

* -I am aware that the method of paying social **security** payments has changed.

* I think there has to be a distinction between social **security** payments and repatriation payments.

* Unlike social **security** payments repatriation payments often are not for day-to-day living.

* The Labor Party in government at no time took the matter to the United Nations, neither in the General Assembly nor the **Security** Council.

* The House should bear in mind that when we came into government Australia was no longer a member of the **Security** Council.

* Then we went into the **Security** Council where we were not members and put forward viewpoints which were the contrary of what you had espoused and connived at during your period in government.

* The Department of Social **Security** and the Treasury- it is always handy to try to have the Treasury on side in these matters- have had a joint working party considering ways in which we can provide some assistance to these organisations.

* The Department of Social **Security** will be producing a quarterly journal from about June onwards.

* The articles will canvass the broad area of social **security** responsibility.

* One of the contributed articles in the first issue - the work of certain officers of the Department of Social **Security** - deals with this subject and canvasses many of the issues which a consideration of this subject must raise.

* and (5 ) It was not until May 1979 that the Department of Social **Security** decided to proceed with establishing a Northcote Regional office.

* Perhaps a clear example of this is the emphasis on **security** of a person who was affected by the depression.

* Older people urge **security** on their children when they are choosing a career.

* Young Australians, however, with their proper optimism are more adventurous, valuing **security** less highly, and take a more willing attitude towards risks which enterprise entails.

* There are, of course, by the nature of activities at Woomera, considerations of safety and **security** involved.

* Various Ministers, including the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant),  have allocated many millions to various projects, including railways, housing, social **security** and a host of other things.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has outlined that the increase in social benefits will cost $126m in a full year.

* I refer the Treasurer to a statement made by the Minister for Social **Security** in the Senate this morning that her DirectorGeneral had decided it was not necessary for his Minister to be informed about the possible payment of up to $200,000 to  Mr Chris  Nakis, and that the Treasurer had final responsibility in the matter.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What concerns me is: If the Government made careful and calculated decisions only about two years ago to allot the amount of money which the Government then considered necessary in the interests of Australian **security**, what does the Government now consider the position to be?

* The question now has to be whether those decisions at the time were the minimal decisions necessary to provide for the **security** of the country for the future or whether they were irreducible minimums below which we have now found ourselves forced to go.

* I would like to think that the position is that there was some leeway in the amount set out to support the White Paper; that it was a figure that was not the absolute bare minimum; and that, therefore, the announcements in this Budget can be seen to have not reached the irreducible rninimum which I would believe is necessary for the proper **security** of the country.

* On 4th May 1965, following the announcement of the decision to provide combat forces for service in South Vietnam, the Australian Acting Per manent Representative to the United Nations sent the following message to the  President  of the **Security** Council.

* The honourable member for Oxley also raised during his comments on the adjournment the generality of government policy concerning refusal of citizenship on grounds of national **security**.

* But much of the information upon which such decisions are taken could of course not be disclosed at an appeal hearing without severe interference with essential **security** intelligence sources.

* I did not say that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation was to be regarded as a wing of government.

* You must ensure that your vote is cast for the Liberal candidate because your future existence in this nursing home, where you are so comfortable, where you are so well looked after and where you know that you have got **security** of existence, is threatened if you return the Labor candidate and if he is part of a Labor Government returned to Canberra '.

* As one who is very much involved in primary industry I want to remind the honourable member for Riverina and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports - and I do acknowledge that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports recognises that there is a very high level in terms of capital requirement for farming these days - that if they are advocating a cutting down of the assets of rural producers then certainly they are hitting well below the belt as far as the **security** of rural industry is concerned.

* There is an amount of $29m in relation to the Department of Social **Security**.

* There is no doubt, of course, that there is very little job **security** in this industry.

* Having found that the Hilton was far and away the best so far as the conference centre and accommodation for the delegates and heads of government were concerned, the next thing, obviously, was for a **security** assessment to be made.

* As a result of the bombing and as a result of conversations with the Premier of New South Wales, much more extensive **security** arrangements were immediately introduced; and I believe necessarily so.

* The arrangements, in the event, were carried out between State and Commonwealth officials and instrumentalities, with a very high degree of co-operation and determination to achieve the necessary **security**.

* Has self-regulation by the industry failed to give people the **security** to which they are entitled; if so, will he take immediate steps to re-introduce the Travel Agents Bill 1975.

* He in fact gave away the **security** of his position in the Public Service to undertake service for the Aboriginal people with the Northern Land Council.

* They include **security** for its people to enjoy a high standard of living with truly satisfying lives in the widest sense and to contribute significantly to the world's less developed nations in every way - by general aid, education, food and contributing to international law and order, by resisting aggression, and influencing to the extent we are able truly peaceful co-operation between nations, based on justice, truth and mercy among men.

* ANZUS is important to our **security**, because agreements by those countries which are parties to it are always honoured, not the empty gestures we see so often elsewhere.

* Members of Parliament on both sides have a solemn duty to be responsible and to guard Australian **security**.

* I talked to the Minister for Social **Security** about this matter.

* It is true that when the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey was undertaken the Director-General of Social **Security** believed that it would breach the confidentiality of his Department's work to give the names of people who were in receipt of unemployment benefits for the purpose of matching them against anything that the survey might reveal.

* I mentioned this to the Minister for Social **Security** and I am very pleased to say that, typical of that gentleman, he has given immediate instructions to his Department that it must co-operate fully with the Bureau of Statistics in any surveys that it may be undertaking to assist in determining what number of people getting unemployment benefit are not entitled to it.

* This Bill provides less **security** to a marriage than is provided by some societies where the State takes no cognisance of marriage at all.

* This Bill provides for divorce by consent of one, with minimal **security** in the period of separation of only 12 months, and with no **security** of requiring previous duration of the marriage over any set period.

* -For the information of honourable members I present volume 2 of the first main report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty together with a statement by the Minister for Social **Security** relating to that report.

* The proposition put forward by the Opposition was that it would allow to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation only the authority to keep under surveillance anybody who had in mind an activity, such as bombing HMAS  Melbourne  which obstructed, hindered or interfered with the Defence Force when an illegal act had been committed.

* What would they say if they directed the Defence Force to carry out a certain task in the defence interests or **security** interests of the country?

* Would not the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  or any member of this House expect a Labor government to tell its **security** organisation to inform it about any persons activities, either lawful or unlawful, which are directed towards obstructing the very function which it had commanded the Defence Force of this country to carry out in the interests of the defence of this country?

* Would a Labor government say to its **security** organisation that it is not interested in getting advice on any activity which is directed towards obstructing the very purpose for which the Government had sent the Defence Force on its way?

* I said: 'As I listen to the honourable member I am driven to the conclusion that he does not believe that there should be a **security** organisation in Australia '.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What reports, excluding annual reports, have been produced by the Department of Social **Security**, by authorities for which the Minister is responsible, and by ad hoc commissions, committees, task forces, etc., within the Minister's portfolio, since 5 December 1972.

* Boys are being conscripted at a time when the Government knows our **security** is not in  danger and when Americans walk past them in thousands on their way home leaving Australians to die and fight their battle.

* If men are to be condemned for this type of thing, the sooner we get rid of **security** police and the Government that tolerates this conduct at demonstrations, the better it will be for democracy in this country.

* The article says: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 25 October 1977: 
The United States has been pressing for liberalisation of government measures affecting trade.

* Its attitude is that liberalisation will ensure greater stability in the market and that a grains reserve system would provide adequate food **security**.

* It greatly concerns and alarms me because it affects the **security** of our nation.

* If that is so, it places our **security** absolutely in jeopardy.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the  following  answer to the honourable member's question.

* The conditions of grant are set out in the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act which provides for the formal documentation of a grant by an agreement at the discretion of the Director-General of Social **Security**.

* -Mr Speaker, with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  over the last 6 months there has been an exchange of correspondence concerning 2 important projects in the electorate of Sydney.

* I do hope that the Minister for Social **Security** in her wisdom will agree to the allocation of this amount of $214,000.

* The estimates went to the State Department of Local Government and were forwarded to the Commonwealth Department of Social **Security**.

* We expect there will be a deputation of South Sydney aldermen, the Mayor of South Sydney, Leichhardt aldermen and the Mayor of Leichhardt to meet the Minister for Social **Security** in connection with these worthy projects for the older people in the area of Sydney.

* I refer to the report relating to the former Ambassador to Yugoslavia,  Mr Malcolm  Booker, where he indicated that his embassy had been subjected to surveillance by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and that he himself had been subjected to ASIO surveillance, contrary to the official rules.

* In accordance with the spirit of the **Security** Appeals Tribunal and the Hope report on **security** and intelligence, which refers to grave and permanent injustice being done to people in the Public Service by such ASIO reports, could those reports be made available to  Mr Booker?

* I support the sentiments of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in the opening paragraphs of his second-reading speech.

* We have before us 2 Bills from the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The ultimate objective is the total control of hospitals through the Department of Social **Security** and of private medical practice through the Department of Health.

* Did a meeting on 7 August 1978 decide that their existing attitudes of possible compromise to allow Mount Isa Mines pipeline and port access is a reasonable concession and if no action is taken to ensure Aboriginal **security** of tenure of Bing Bong, Robinson River and other areas that tension will increase and may lead to trouble for Aboriginals and others.

* The Minister for Social **Security** should know that any member on either side of the House may object to leave being granted to have something incorporated in Hansard.

* -Two weeks ago, I made a statement to the House on measures that were to be brought into operation progessively to improve the **security** of Parliament House and the safety of people in the building.

* At the time I told the House an officer had been appointed to co-ordinate **security** measures throughout the building.

* It was clear at the outset, however, that  Mr President  and I needed to have the benefit of advice on these matters from a person who not only had a sound appreciation and knowledge of the Parliament but also had first hand experience in protective **security** arrangements.

* It cannot be repeated too often that the supreme objective of our foreign policy is to protect and enhance our **security** and other vital interests - political, economic and social.

* We must do this with the knowledge that our own welfare and **security** are inextricably bound up with the welfare and **security** of others.

* There is no formula by which one can determine a lump sum payment of compensation that will guarantee the **security** of the dependants and will also give due regard to a deceased employee's age, earnings and commitments.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** aware that the handling of inquiries received from members of the Federal and State parliaments by the Department of Social **Security** in Western Australia has been banned as a result of industrial action by staff associations?

* Can the Minister indicate what action will be taken by the Government to overcome the callous disregard of the needs of pensioners by the staff of the Department of Social **Security** in Western Australia?

* Is the Minister aware that in the financial year 1975-76, 12 996 Commonwealth repatriation, social **security** and taxation cheques were handed over to the Commonwealth Police as cases of forgery and uttering cheques under section 67b of the Crimes Act 1 975 and that in most instances the cheques were stolen from letter boxes, from boarding houses or by finding as a result of misdelivery of mail?

* It was not until the Act of Settlement in 1702 that judges were given statutory **security** of tenure in office.

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Has the number of young people living in the areas mentioned and seeking social **security** benefits doubled in the past 7 months?

* What action does the Government intend to take to make sure that these people can be gainfully employed or work for the social **security** assistance being given to them, thus making a contribution for the benefit of the nation?

* It is administered by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* I think that perhaps it is no use asking **Security** to have a look at this because, of course, **Security** is now the creature of the Government which is out to cover up and help the communists.

* But I think that if **Security** were given a free and honest hand in this matter we should be having a look at some of the contacts between Fretilin leaders and some of the left wing of the supporters of the Australian Labor Party.

* Did he indicate shortly after the appointment of his Ministry that normal **security** checks would not be applied to all ministerial staffs?

* Finally, was his initial reluctance to take this obviously sensible course of requiring normal **security** checks for ministerial staffs based upon a reasonable apprehension of the consequences if normal **security** procedures were applied to certain of his Ministers?

* As the right honourable member should know, the policy of previous Governments has been never to provide an individual with the result of any **security** check made on him.

* The present Government has set up the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Intelligence and **Security** Services of the Australian Government, the terms of reference of which provide for recommendations to be made as to the procedures that should be introduced to permit review of administrative decisions affecting citizens which were, or may have been, based on reports of an adverse kind furnished by the **security** and intelligence services of the Government.

* It took questioning at some length from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to elicit finally from the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  some preliminary estimation of the cost of Medibank.

* It seems to me that the proper responsibilities of any national government require that that government should, firstly, guarantee the **security** of the nation and, secondly, guarantee the value of the money of the people of that nation.

* In both these areas- the **security** of the nation and the guaranteeing of the continued value of the people's money- this present Government has possibly the worst record of any government in living memory in Australia.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: 
1 direct a question to the Minister for Supply.

* Firstly, why does his Department insist on a **security** check on members of the community who are not employed by his Department?

* Secondly, after such **security** investigations are made why does his Department contemplate action against employees of the Department by way of demotion, involving loss of earnings, because of their social contact with members of the community?

* Finally, why does his Department regard such people as being aliens and therefore subject to **security** investigation?

* This procedure would conform to the normal and necessary Defence practice of holding individuals responsible for protecting information, the release of which would be prejudicial to national **security**.

* The requirement for those concerned in the chemical warfare trials to give **security** undertakings would have been no different from similar requirements in many other operations affecting national **security**.

* The other matter which I wanted to mention concerns **security** appeals.

* There are migrants whose applications for naturalisation are deferred or rejected on **security** grounds or who have been notified of the grounds upon which it is proposed to deport them.

* Is the Prime Minister also aware that a major concern of the Association is a proposal in draft legislation to set up the new Australian Police Force which, the Association claims, downgrades police officers serving in high **security** areas such as airports?

* The Government recently agreed in principle to the acceptance of conditional purchase tenure in my own State of New South Wales as a suitable **security** for war service homes purposes.

* Strata titles can how be accommodated and 99-year leases can be offered as **security**.

* Following yesterday's incident at Sydney International Airport, can the Minister for Transport report to the House on the effectiveness of **security** measures at that airport?

* Is there a need for a review of our airport **security** measures.

* Are they in any way substandard when compared with **security** measures at other international airports around the world?

* Amongst the chief of them was the concept of building a population as an immediate aid to the nation's **security**.

* Naturally on an issue such as this I cannot answer on behalf of the new DirectorGeneral of Social Services or indeed the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I certainly do not think that the Minister for Social **Security** would be taking any action which would differ from actions she has taken in the past on this issue.

* However, I will refer the question to the Minister for Social **Security** and make sure that the honourable member gets an answer as soon as possible.

* However, I would say that Australia would, of course, support any initiative which might lead to greater **security** or stability in this area.

* However, in principle,, we support anything directed to the **security** and stability of the area.

* -In answer to the Minister, in my view the present incumbent of the position of Director-General of **Security** has neither a mortgage on wisdom nor longevity.

* I support the remarks of the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  on what can be done by **security** organisations.

* It stated: 
A former FBI man, who was with the Bureau at the time, had no other justification to offer for this barbarity than to say that getting involved in radical politics could get you involved in national **security**, that the kid with the picket sign might turn into the kid with the bomb.

* Do I assume from the lack of checks and balances in the current legislation that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is to go down the line with its own improvised rules?

* Yet the professionals in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation felt impelled to regard the disclosure of such information as a grave infringement of national **security**.

* This legislation- the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill and the cognate Billsprovides an opportunity for the Parliament to debate the need for a **security** organisation in Australia and to consider the nature and structure of that organisation and, more importantly, its role in Australian society.

* Already this debate largely has been concerned with the degree to which the legislation balances the need for adequate **security** on the one hand with the rights and the liberties of the Australian citizen on the other hand.

* The Australian Labor Party and the Opposition accepts as a principle that Australia, like every other modern nation state, requires a properly based **security** intelligence force to protect the nation.

* Whether we like it or not, the history of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, like that of other intelligence agencies in Western society, shows that it has often abused its role and the rights of the ordinary Australian citizen.

* For years they were refused naturalisation on the basis of an adverse **security** report.

* He had the backing and the support of his permanent head but was refused that appointment on the basis of an adverse **security** report.

* As I have already pointed out, the actions- often they are illegal- of the **security** forces adversely affected and caused loss and disadvantage to thousands of Australian citizens who had no redress by way of judicial scrutiny and no opportunity to right the real wrong that was done to them.

* Any **security** intelligence gathering organisation in the discharge of its statutory duties, in my view, has a prime duty and a prime obligation to protect the rights and the liberties of the Australian citizen.

* This legislation is very critical to the proper operation of our **security** forces and, indeed, to the hard won rights of the ordinary Australian citizen.

* There should be no presumptions of liberality because we like the personality or the character of the Director-General, the present Attorney-General or any of those other people who as a result of their responsibilities have to be involved in weighing carefully important **security** decisions.

* He tends to believe that people who disagree with him are likely to be subversive and ought properly to be the subject of some sort of **security** check.

* I was concerned to hear him argue so illogically that the same sorts of standards and prescriptions that apply to a company or a trade union- which is a public organisation, a voluntary organisation, like a company, with rules laid down- ought to apply to a **security** service, in the face of the findings of  Mr Justice  White and  Mr Justice  Hope and in the face of all the body of accumulated evidence that the laws have been broken and the rights of the ordinary citizen have been transgressed.

* Ultimately, any **security** structure has to be responsible to the Minister, the Minister has to be accountable to Cabinet, and Cabinet has to be accountable to Parliament.

* There are certain matters which obviously are matters of discretion and **security** and there is a clearly established parliamentary procedure by which the Minister will not disclose information or give answers which he believes go to the question of the **security** of the nation.

* Without taking a short term, politically sectarian attitude, I believe that it is appropriate and proper that on these matters that go to the whole question of national **security** the Leader of the Opposition, whoever he may be, ought to be properly involved and the consultation ought to be real and effective.

* That would not trammel the **security** service.

* Does anybody believe that the Hope report weakened and eroded the basis of our **security** intelligence organisation?

* All we are proposing, as part of the permanent fabric of this legislation, is that in order to keep our **security** service on the rails, instead of there being a casual exercise, depending upon the whim of the government of the day, there is a permanent and on-going process by which the Parliament, the government and the people of Australia can be informed.

* Is there anything more important than the relationship that ought to exist between this Parliament, the Executive, the **security** and intelligence service and the people of Australia?

* I do not necessarily say that a committee will find all the answers, but I do believe that it would serve one very important purpose; it might serve the purpose of endeavouring to lift our **security** and intelligence organisation out of the traditional, historic role of party politics which is part of its history.

* It is time that this Parliament looked at the importance and the relevance of this legislation and the sort of role that needs to be performed by our **security** intelligence organisation.

* This Parliament needs legislation which will ensure not only that our **security** intelligence service can play its role effectively in a complex and continually changing international and national situation but also that that **security** service does not simply pay lip service to the rhetoric of civil liberties but by its very charter gives meaning to the checks and balances which would make that service - 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
That is another area in which Queensland has a dismal record.

* So we find for political purposes theologians, atheists and communists lumped together in Queensland as the threat to the solidity and the **security** of the society.

* -I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the fact that **security** organisations must be answerable to Parliament in some manner, will he consider making the Australian **Security** Organisations answerable either to a subcommittee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence or the appointment of a special parliamentary authority consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and one other member of the Government?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Another vital point relates to the suggestion about the role of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* It is not without interest and relevance to this subject matter to note that today the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  supported the new **security** arrangements which were announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in his major statement on this matter today.

* It is utterly inconceivable that either  Mr Mahoney  who, at the relevant time, was head of the **security** intelligence organisation or  Mr Justice  Woodward, would do anything improper.

* Dr Kissinger  had written to me on 20 October, in the particular context of emphasising the important role for Australia to play in the **Security** Council since Australia's ambassador to the United Nations was  President  in that month.

* On 21 October I wrote back assuring him of our complete support in his efforts to bring about a ceasefire and saying that we would apply those efforts both in the **Security** Council and outside.

* Later - I forget the date - appreciation was conveyed, but not in a letter, of the efforts of Australia's ambassador to the United Nations as  President  of the **Security** Council.

* The correspondence took place well before the alert, had no reference to it, and the Secretary of State and the State Department very much appreciate what Australia did while our ambassador was  President  of the **Security** Council.

* The Commonwealth was actually enrolling these eligible persons with a voluntary health insurance fund during the period of their eligibility and was providing them with a certificate of entitlement from the Department of Social **Security** to allow them to receive pharmaceutical benefits items at half the cost to the general public.

* They applied to the Department of Social **Security**.

* Unemployment and sickness benefit recipients and special benefit recipients were notified and were issued with a certificate by the Department of Social **Security** when they were awarded a benefit.

* But unfortunately, as the 1974-75 annual report of the Department of Social **Security** indicates, the scheme was not working very well because only about one-third of those eligible were actually participating in it.

* Construction of a perimeter **security** fence, gate control, official vehicle garage and flammable liquids store are also included in the proposal.

* I thought I was hearing incorrectly but it would appear that the honourable member for Port Adelaide was advocating a system of identification to make it easier for people to get social **security** payments.

* My experience in my electorate and throughout various parts of Sydney has been that people with a genuine need to be recipients of social **security** benefits have no problem in proving their identification.

* But if the Government resorts to an easy system of identification, as advocated by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, we will throw the whole social **security** system open to fraud.

* The honourable member for Port Adelaide's suggestion is advocating sheer recklessness and opening the social **security** system to people who are not in need but who are prepared to exploit the system.

* The first concerns the matter of **security** as it affects Parliament House.

* I understand that certain **security** precautions are taken with people entering the House.

* The point that I want to make is that as part of the **security** precautions that were taken her handbag was thoroughly searched.

* It seems to me to be quite extraordinary that an officer of the House should remove and take a document which could have no bearing whatsoever on the **security** of this Parliament.

* A letter from two officials that I tabled in the House the other day made reference to a **security** report.

* I repeat to the House and, I trust, to the country that the **security** in the movement of the Prime Minister of this country, irrespective of his political allegiance, now is a very considerable undertaking by any airline company.

* They are lent against the **security** of growers' own funds totalling about $80m in all and against the **security** of the clip at the modest interest rate of 1 1 per cent, a usurer's interest rate, or so it would have been regarded in our time.

* Compare the support at 11 per cent interest which is given to the average farmer, support which has to be repaid in full against the **security** of the clip and the **security** of his own levies, with the straight-out grants to secondary industries to prevent retrenchments.

* I appreciate that this need will remain after the provision of a high **security** animal quarantine station.

* However, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories does conduct an international virus reference laboratory which provides some of the facilities which no doubt would be required for a high **security** veterinary virus laboratory.

* The Commonwealth Serum Laboratory has made some representations to me for the provision of a high **security** virus laboratory to be conducted as an extension of the CSL's international virus reference laboratory.

* If the honourable member can supply further details I shall see that they are taken into account when decisions are being reached regarding a high **security** virus laboratory.

* The Government looks for arms for national **security**.

* There is no doubt- and a great body of world opinion now accepts this-that the arms race is the greatest threat to the **security** of the world.

* To curb abuses of the system by both doctors and patients through the use of unnecessary services, particularly pathology services; to end the open-ended nature of the Commonwealth financial commitment to the States under the original hospital cost-sharing arrangements; to restore the competitive position of private hospitals by ensuring that public hospital charges were raised to more realistic levels; to ensure that benefits are no longer paid to relieve governments, public authorities and employees of costs that would, but for Medibank, have been borne by them; to legislate so that insurers accept their responsibility in workers compensation and third party insurance cases; to introduce major improvements to the Nursing Home Benefits Scheme to give financial **security** to all patients and share the financial load with the private health funds.

* They are living in comfort and **security** in Australia, in the metropolis of Sydney, and some of them have substantial wealth.

* Department of Social **Security** 
Another ludicrous anomaly to which my attention was drawn-this is one of the strictures on the Family Court- is the confidentiality provmons which apply, certainly in the Social **Security** Act and, as I understand it, in the Repatriation Act.

* I have had two cases drawn to my attention in which a parent obtained through the Social **Security** Department the address of a spouse who had defied the Family Court order for custody and abducted the child.

* The name in turn was transmitted to the Department of Social **Security** through the Family Court, but the Department of Social **Security** refused to furnish the Family Court with the address of the offending parent so that the warrant could be executed.

* For instance, if this Tribunal takes over some social **security** appeals, appeals under the Life Insurance Act and the Insurance Act, and repatriation appeals it would be impossible for the  President  to deal with them.

* I know that in the Australian Capital Territory, for example, it is one of my hopes that soon we will have the magistrates independent of the Attorney-General's Department and given the **security** of tenure of judges.

* The more serious ground of the motion is that I made public information concerning Australia's **security**.

* He it was who revealed in the Parliament on 2nd December - that was in 1971, I hasten to add - **security** and intelligence arrangements between Australia and Indonesia.

* On 20th July U Thant expressed apprehension about the deterioration in the **security** situation.

* He suggested that the United Nations **Security** Council was in a position to consider the situation and to reach some agreed conclusions as to measures which might be taken.

* It is - believed that members of the **Security** Council have informally discussed together U Thant's initiative but they have not taken the matter up.

* Of course, Australia is not a member of the **Security** Council at this point.

* In addition the Director-General of the Department of Social **Security** requires that the person be registered for employment with the CES.

* Service is required to report the facts to the Department of Social **Security** which is obliged to reject a claim, or terminate benefit, and to advise the person of the right of appeal.

* He is proud of the situation that has developed in social **security**.

* Social **security** at this stage in Australia ought not to be just something to do with the deserving poor.

* The questions of separation, habitation and cohabitation arise also, as I understand, in some social **security** legislation.

* In that situation, a woman who is separated from her husband, divorced or widowed and who has a man living in her house, whether she be having some relationship with him or not, finds that the Government and the Department of Social **Security** take the view that she should not be in receipt of a social **security** pension.

* A woman may live with somebody and be regarded as separated in terms of divorce requirements, but she cannot live with somebody and be regarded as separated with respect to qualification for the receipt of a social **security** pension.

* If funds of this size are available to the Government they should be used in areas to which private enterprise is not attracted such as social **security**, child care centres and the abolition of the means test.

* What **security** of tenure has a State or a company?

* We know that Australian mining companies trade with Japan, and many other countries 
Previously in the House I and others have referred to the need for a maximum **security** animal quarantine station and for a diagnostic laboratory.

* More specifically, on this particular amendment the crucial decision is whether or not the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation should be politicised.

* The way in which to politicise Australia's **security** intelligence organisation is to place it under ministerial control, to put a Minister in the situation where he has legislative authority to obtain details in respect of every single file, dossier or record.

* We then will have in this country the unfortunate situation that obtains in the United States- a politicised **security** intelligence organisation.

* More importantly it would politicise in a most important area of its operation the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation upon which the national **security** of Australia depends.

* If the Opposition does so it is likely to destroy ASIO or destroy its capacity to protect the **security** of this nation.

* It points out that, since about 20 per cent of our community are currently 'migrants', a similar proportion of the Commonwealth's general expenditure on education, health, social **security** and welfare and other areas should be for the benefit of migrants.

* On income **security**, we will be giving high priority to resolving anomalies affecting migrants, in the light of the problems outlined by the Review.

* Let me say this: A Budget is something that can be altered, that can be improved upon, that can be criticised; the safety and **security** of this country cannot.

* I would say that there are many times when the excuse that we are undermining freedoms is used by those who themselves would desire to undermine the freedom and **security** of this country.

* Might there not come a time when people will realise that this policy and thought of the Government is right not for the sake of an election factor but because it is for the safety and **security** of this country?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* It is plain that Australia needs them but it also ought to be plain to them and to Australia that they need Telecom for their jobs, for their **security**.

* What other industry, what other employer, has achieved that in terms of **security** for its own employees?

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The need for the Government as a matter of urgency to make a statement on the plight of the people of South Vietnam in their courageous defence against the blatant invasion by North Vietnam and its serious implications for the **security** of Australia.'

* Another aspect of the statement raised by the Minister is its implications for Australian **security**.

* Why not extend the compass of his trip to include a firsthand assessment of the alleged threat to Australian **security** from renewed fighting in Vietnam?

* If there is a threat to Australian **security** as suggested by the Minister this afternoon and by Government backbenchers on Tuesday, then there is a clear duty on the Prime Minister to assess the threat at first hand and take appropriate action.

* On behalf of the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party, I ask whether the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will withdraw the advertisements appearing in the Press, offering the White Paper for sale, until it is corrected- 
I think one could quite easily consider contemporary examples of the same kind.

* I do not think any of us on either side of the House are particularly happy about the necessity to have a **security** intelligence organisation.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Is he also able to say whether the 1976 New Zealand Commission of Inquiry noted that long term **security** of supply of oil is of prime importance; if so, what steps has the Government taken to ensure long term **security** in view of the increasing Australian dependence on imported crude oil.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
This Parliament legislated to bring self-management to these and other communities which sought to take advantage of our legislation.

* The agreement reached with the Queensland Government sought to achieve these two basic aims: first, the self-management for those communities because their reserves had been abolished; and secondly, **security** of tenure for their continued use and occupancy of the land which they and their forebears had occupied for years and years.

* How is it that despite sanctions, Australia's exports to Southern Rhodesia have risen in each of the last three years and Australia has risen from ninth to second place among exporters to Southern Rhodesia as appears from Annex II of the Second Report of the Committee established in pursuance of the **Security** Council Resolution of 29th May 1968.

* The Department of Social **Security** has estimated that the costs to the Commonwealth of rehabilitating persons to be placed in employment are likely to be recovered, by way of reduced pensions and benefit liability and additional tax paid on earnings, in a minimum period of 4 years.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Because of the fiasco of the interrupted debate on the White Paper on defence last Thursday, I have decided to speak in this grievance debate.

* I am appalled at the very low priority given to the vital subject of the **security** of the nation.

* We would also raise the relationship between the Department of Social **Security** and the police and the actions that were taken.

* There were 3 members of the Australian Labor Party on that Committee  Mr Berinson, Dr Gun  and  Mr Hayden  who is now the Minister for Social **Security**.

* These arrangements have led to long term contractual undertakings which will give Australian primary producers, especially wheat growers, the kind of **security** that they have never had before in Australian history.

* Very often when we are dealing with poorer countries, some people of which may be suffering from famine, it is of advantage to the buyers to know what they can expect from Australia where we have the **security** of knowing what the demand is.

* None has been so destructive of family **security**, as contemptuous of family welfare or as corrosive of family life.

* Indicative economic planning must be undertaken as a vital part of any program of recovery to ease the way for change successfully while providing for the **security** of jobs and of people's livelihoods.

* That **security** must be guaranteed, along with the proper support programs, if the process of change is to be understood and accepted in the work place.

* I call the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The only redeeming feature one can find is that if it is the policy of the Opposition in regard to matters of social **security** benefits to reduce the standard rate of pension by $2.50 a week and the combined married rate pension by $4 a week, at least it represents an improvement on the policy that Opposition members were espousing a little earlier in the piece when they proposed that pensions should be increased only by amounts equal to movements in the cost of living.

* If we followed that policy, the standard rate of pension would be - 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 May 1979: 
What was the subsidy given to the City of Parramatta Council by the Department of Social **Security** for the provision of the Meals-on- Wheels service in each of the years 1972 to 1978.

* The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  will remember the day when we, along with the present Treasurer  (Mr Hayden),  at that time the shadow Minister for social **security** and health, toured the western suburbs of Sydney and we looked at the hospitals right throughout the area.

* This right of access excludes only the 2 national communications rooms of the operating partners, to which, in accordance with standard practice at all joint installations, access is restricted to preserve national cipher **security**.

* The office I now hold is only held subject to a one-monthly renewal; so what **security** of tenure do I or does the Department of Services and Property hold?

* Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care, and necessary social services and the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age, and other lack of livelihood beyond his control.

* Special **security** payments will have to be complemented and augmented through counselling services, rehabilitation facilities and other specific social services in order to make them as effective as possible.

* The success of Labor's approach to planning for the future in this field will depend on the willingness of both social **security** and social service agencies to work together for the social and political goals involved, and on the co-operation achieved among social, medical, vocational and other members of the welfare establishment.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* It is dangerous because we are being lulled into a false sense of **security**.

* Now that such relief payments are taxable, a case could be sustained to extend household relief and support in cases of real need, particularly where producers are forced to live on properties without income, not only to maintain the property but also to retain the **security** of their properties not always for themselves but in some cases for their banker-landlords.

* The plight is universal- no liquidity, dwindling **security** and lessening hope.

* Legal listening, as it is termed, is a matter for **Security**.

* That can only take place when it is authorised by the Attorney-General, who in turn would have had a request from the Director-General of **Security**.

* The monitoring in due course is performed only by the DirectorGeneral of **Security**.

* Is the Prime Minister aware of the statement by the New Guinean Chief Minister,  Mr Michael  Somare, in which he said that his national coalition Government was well aware of the uncertainty felt by many expatriate officers and was concerned at the delays in finalising the revised employment **security** scheme for permanent overseas officers?

* At that time a third Bill, the Telephone Communications (Interception) Bill, was necessary to carry out the policy of my Government that **security** matters should all be co-ordinated under the authority of the Prime Minister.

* I apprehend that  Mr Justice  Hope will be making recommendations on this matter pursuant to his royal commission into the intelligence and **security** services of the Australian Government.

* That is, the head of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation-  should be filled by a judge and that in the Government's view this position should in future always be filled by a person holding judicial office.

* My Government responded to public interest in Australian **security** activities by appointing  Mr Justice  Hope to conduct the royal commission which I have mentioned.

* When in this Parliament, we pass laws concerning repatriation or social **security**, one would concede that it is appropriate to use the term 'Director-General' because there is a well known public office in each State capital headed by a director.

* As you would know, when you were Leader of the Opposition we informed you of all the major policy matters and appointments in the **security** field.

* You will remember that before  Mr Justice  Hope was appointed as Royal Commissioner into the intelligence and **security** services of the Australian Government I had let you see the terms of reference.

* -Mr Speaker, I can assure you that later when there were changes in the head of some of the **security** organisations, such as the appointment of  Mr Justice  Woodward himself, your successor, the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  was similarly informed.

* I believe this policy is important if we in the Parliament and if the public in general are to have informed debate on those issues which fall within the **security** and intelligence field and if we are to avoid overreaction on **security** issues based on partial information.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
With reference to question No.

* 2589 of the member for Macarthur, what has been the total cost to the Government of examination of issues and preparation of reports by the Department of Social **Security**, by authorities for which the Minister is responsible, and by ad hoc commissions, committees, task forces, etc., within the Minister's portfolio, since 5 December 1972.

* Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* Of course, our standard of living has increased in other less quantifiable ways also - greater social **security**, improved cultural facilities, improved community services, better quality houses and so on.

* Finally, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard- the  Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  agreed to this when he was in the House- an outline of the initiatives of the Fraser Government in the area of social **security**.

* He appreciated the need for Australia to recognise that its **security** depended on events in a number of areas of the world.

* The common feature of the schemes was that a taxpayer borrowed money and gave some **security** to the lender for the loan.

* Borrowed moneys were then utilised in earning assessable income for the taxpayer who then arranged for the lender to release the **security** in consideration for payment of a substantial amount, usually an amount equal to one-half of the amount borrowed.

* A deduction under section  67a  was claimed by the taxpayer for the amount paid to secure the release or discharge of the mortgage given by him as **security** for the repayment of the money which he had borrowed.

* So, let us examine the improvements claimed by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and his supporters.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 23 May 1979: 
1 ) When were limits for income from other sources affecting the provision of fringe benefits for social **security** pensioners last increased.

* They can be interpreted in many ways and taken very much on goodwill but the words used by the Prime Minister is relation to **security** and other matters must throw considerable doubt upon our long-term good faith.

* To determine whether Australia can fulfil its commitments to our allies, to follow up and support our fundamental **security** interests, one has to look, in these circumstances, to the machinations of the Labor Party Conference.

* More than 60 per cent of the married women in Australia are not in the work force and, therefore, are not entitled to any payment other than the $30 social **security** maternity payment which all pregnant women receive.

* That can include a paternity leave provision and the provision of a social **security** payment for all pregnant women and fathers-to-be.

* The final group is the unmarried mothers who can receive only the social **security** entitlement.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What sum has been paid by the Department of Social **Security**, or by Departments formerly encompassing the functions now performed by that Department, to each airline for air travel within Australia during the last 2 years.

* Our aid of S5.5m seems to be a pretty paltry level of assistance on a human level, and if we use the more material proposition of insurance, which was what we were using to justify our presence in Vietnam, then it is a pretty poor premium to be paying to ensure the future **security** of Australia if the Government ever seriously believed its own propaganda about Vietnam.

* Of course that is what history has proved it to be: A milestone along the road of **security** for wool producers.

* As a matter of fact,  Mr Van  Bibra who had some respect and some authority in the wool industry at the time was right when he said: 
I certainly think that there was every justification for such remarks because, after many years of dissension and debate, a Labor government gave to the industry some kind of **security**, by setting up a scheme that guaranteed a floor price which was completely justified on commercial terms, and one which offered the growers of this country a reasonable level of income when the going was tough.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 21 March, 1979: 
The Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Bill 1975 seeks to modify the present employment **security** scheme arrangements for those members of the group who agree to transfer over to direct contract employment with the Papua New Guinea Government.

* I turn finally to the Social **Security** Bill (No.

* The object of this Bill is to amend the Social **Security** Act to enable former residents of external territories, including Papua New Guinea, to qualify for social services pensions if they come to Australia to live.

* Residence in Norfolk Island is excluded from the ambit of the Bill in view of the recent appointment of a royal commission into matters, including social **security**, relating to Norfolk Island.

* Indeed, I do not think it likely that it can take place because no resolution for a revision can be put forward without the approval of the **Security** Council, and in the **Security** Council the veto of one permanent member is sufficient to abort any such resolution.

* Three of the permanent members of the **Security** 
It is appropriate that the honourable member for St George  (Mr Neil)  spoke about hypocrisy because he certainly speaks with much expertise on the topic.

* The honourable member for Denison is prepared to vote against the Government on the question of the Curran scheme to protect tax avoiders on the basis that it is contrary to Liberal Party policy, but we will see tonight whether he will vote against the Government's decision to reduce the means test for pensioners and on the reduction of social **security** and repatriation pensions.

* Let us look at the social **security** position as far as this particular amending piece of legislation is concerned.

* He said: 
The Government has given a commitment to protect social **security** pensions from erosion by inflation through automatically adjusting pension levels each six months according to the movements in the Consumer Price Index.

* There is no doubt that in the Department of Social **Security** a strong anti-migrant bias exists.

* One has to look only at the attitude in Sydney as far as Australians of Greek origin are concerned in relation to social **security** payments.

* Surely an acrosstheboard investigation would not reveal that 1,000 plus people of Greek origin and none of any other origin were in receipt of social **security** benefits to which they were not entitled.

* I repeat: There is an obvious anti-migrant bias amongst the members of the Department of Social **Security** and, I think, amongst the members of the Commonwealth Police Force who were involved in this matter.

* That bias in the Department of Social **Security** is all the more reason for our getting some explanation as to why the changes have been introduced.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 20 October 1977: 
-This is the fourth occasion on which this legislation has been debated.

* On the other 3 occasions the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  adopted the same approach as he has adopted today, that is, criticising the present scheme without once giving details of how the Government's proposed scheme will work.

* The Minister for Social **Security** is very good at criticising the cost estimates of other people's schemes but consistently refuses to update his rather inaccurate cost estimates of 12 months ago.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I do not concede that **security** services should be answerable to the Parliament.

* **Security** services should be answerable to a Minister who is answerable to the Parliament.

* I do not believe that anybody who is likely to be a Prime Minister would take any steps to see that **security** services will be responsible to Parliament or to any Parliamentary committee.

* The Leader of the Opposition knows, and I believe everybody in the Parliament knows, and the public should know, that there is no item of **security** to which I do not give access to the Leader of the Opposition when he wishes it.

* There are very few people in this Parliament who have been fully briefed on **security** matters.

* Sometimes you receive information which has a national **security** aspect.

* The Minister said that 'Papua New Guinea was determined to look after its own **security** problems in the future' and that 'no country can lightly contemplate either the dispatch of their own forces or the acceptance of foreign forces to deal with an essentially domestic situation.'.

* Papua New Guinea and Australian Ministers have constantly stated that primary responsibility for the maintenance of internal **security** in Papua New Guinea rests with the Papua New Guinea police force.

* Again, to spell it out for the honourable member for Kooyong, the Australian Government's view remains that it would be extremely reluctant to become involved in an internal **security** situation in Papua New Guinea.

* In the words of  Mr Kiki,  the Papua New Guinea Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations, Papua New Guinea was determined to look after its own **security** problems in the future'.

* I have had the opportunity on a number of occasions to discuss these matters with the Chief Minister,  Mr Somare,  together with the Minister for Science in the Australian Government and, naturally, we have had discussions which concern the internal **security** of Papua New Guinea.

* On each occasion it has been made clear to us that the responsibility for internal **security** in Papua New Guinea after independence will be the responsibility of those authorities.

* As I said, it has been made clear by both the Chief Minister and the Minister for Defence of Papua New Guinea that the question of the internal **security** arrangements of that country will rest primarily with the Papua New Guinea police force.

* The second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on the States Grants (Home Care) Bill once again was indicative of the quality of the man.

* The whole social **security** legislation at the present time would surely indicate that the Minister is losing both a policy war and a personal battle.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Is the Commonwealth Development Bank allowed to accept stock or plant mortgages as **security** for loans to farmers, particularly share farmers, who have no real property, if so, can this fact be publicised.

* But the important thing is that whatever is negotiated has to meet those fundamental desires for **security** of land tenure and self-management.

* It is essential for the **security** of the region that Australian troops enter this region to ensure the **security** of the local inhabitants.

* I am satisfied that the troops approached their task with the proper degree of **security** and attention that was required of them.

* Consideration is being given to the question of a reciprocal social **security** agreement with Malta.

* What is the Department of Social **Security** for?

* But the most important department to me seems to be the Department of Social **Security**, which served this country very well as the Department of Social Services over the years.

* Surely there is some duplication here, or there seems to be some threat to the Department of Social **Security**.

* I turn to clause 17. 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 February 1977: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* These violent fluctuations we have seen in the last 3 years again point to the fact that we must have marketing reform with some degree of stability to iron out the fluctuations and give **security** to this great industry.

* The real acceleration in growth was in social **security** expenditure which rose from 16.7 per cent in 1967-68 to a mammoth 26.7 per cent in 1976-77.

* Expenditure this year on social **security** should reach 27.2 per cent.

* Expenditure on education, health and social **security**- only three items in the Budget- totals 47 per cent, nearly 50 per cent, of total expenditure.

* Expenditure on education has risen from $172m in 1967-68 to $2,37 lm this year and expenditure on health from $360m to $2,8 14m and expenditure on social **security** from $ 1,039m to $7,248m.

* This section relates to a certificate being given by the Attorney-General which says that in certain circumstances there is a question of **security** and a question of public interest which must be taken into consideration.

* Yes, by the Minister for Social **Security** for the second time this week.

* The Minister for Social **Security** can hand out thousands of dollars under the Australian Assistance Plan.

* The Minister- 
The Minister for Social **Security** .

* But, for some reason or other, the Minister for Social **Security** cannot bring himself to backdate to 1 June, as the Opposition wants, this increase in nursing home benefits to keep the aged and the sick inside homes.

* When the Minister for Social **Security** produced the Australian Assistance Plan to this House I said on behalf of the Opposition - the Minister was correct in quoting me - that it was a good document and that it was supported by the Opposition.

* The point we are making is that it is pork barrelling political patronage- 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
But what are some of the difficulties which can arise?

* A recent New Zealand royal commission into social **security** at paragraph 21/92 stated:   we note -the view expressed to us by the representative of the State Advances Corporation that while the amount of capitalised family benefit has been invaluable as a deposit, it has had a very limited effect in reducing outgoings on a house.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 26 September 1979: 
Can he say whether an officer in the Department of Social **Security** in Sydney recently indicated to a professional actor of long standing that his profession is not a serious one, nor an established profession, and therefore any permanent members of it would be ineligible for unemployment benefits.

* They have less **security** about their future here than was the case in the countries from which they came.

* Even those who sell their wheat through the Wheat Board are unanimous that wheat growers must be provided with a marketing system capable of guaranteeing an element of price **security**.

* This will give it an advantage in enabling the programs mentioned by the honourable member for Corio to be continued with even greater **security** than would have been the case if those programs had received a fixed amount triennially.

* It is obvious that differences exist between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  and also differences between the Federal Government and the New South Wales Government on how federal funds should be spent.

* I cannot vouch for the fact that he did make them but the reports indicate that he stated that when in New Guinea he was under surveillance by **Security**.

* This allegation would be more serious than it is if the honourable and learned gentleman of late had not been playing rather fast and loose with the truth in relation to certain matters connected with his trip to New Guinea, but coming from the Leader of the Opposition the allegation is nevertheless serious and I propose to deal with it even though it involves breaking a rule which should only be broken in particular circumstances, namely, that I as the Minister responsible for the **Security** Service should not in general either confirm or deny allegations made concerning that service.

* What additional **security** measures have been taken recently at the Prime Minister's Lodge.

* What has been the cost of these additional **security** measures.

* Is lt intended to add to the **security** measures being taken; if so, what will be the cost.

* Does the Attorney-General or his advisers have any idea of the identity of any persons who may be considered to have endangered **security** at the Prime Minister's Lodge.

* The committees further recommended the removal of responsibility for continual work testing and income support procedures from the CES; that income support should be assumed by the Department of Social **Security**; that the CES should concentrate on the placement of job seekers; and that the Department of Social **Security** needed more decentralised offices and outposted staff to carry out face to face interviews and counselling.

* That where an adverse work test report is received the Department of Social **Security** immediately interview the claimant or beneficiary with a view to obtaining a written acknowledgement of the facts in the CES report and any further statement he may wish to make, and that these matters be taken into account by the Department of Social **Security** in deciding the issue.

* A home is basic to our **security**.

* If they had, perhaps they would give some **security** to those who have worked for many years in the Housing Commission and the Holmesglen construction factory and who have given very good service.

* It gives me great personal pleasure to have an opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on measures which not only bring equality to areas where anomalies have existed but also take politics out of pensions and benefits.

* In past elections all social **security** beneficiaries have had to wait anxiously to see which party was elected and then to see what promises it was prepared to keep.

* It demonstrated to social **security** beneficiaries just how little hope they could expect from my opponents and how little concern my opponents really had for pensioners.

* It is unfortunate that, despite the good efforts of the Minister for Social **Security** to ensure regular pension payments and regular increases in pensions, action has been taken to mortgage such increases in advance.

* All possible government help should be given to them to reduce such costs even, if necessary, by the provision of management staff from the Department of Social **Security**.

* With a telephone they feel some **security**.

* A telephone gives a feeling of **security** which without it the people do not have at all.

* Did the matters mentioned in the statement include the effectiveness of the Treaty, the **security** guarantees given by the nuclear weapons parties, the nature and content of the safeguard agreements with the International Atomic Energy and the right of non-nuclear weapons parties to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

* What steps has the Government taken since the signing of the Treaty by Australia to satisfy itself that the Treaty, will not impair Australia's **security** .

* I think the outstanding feature of the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was his announcement that the Government intends to establish a national council ,for the handicapped.

* To test ' the bona fides of my friend the Leader of - the House, I have some background notes to my - speech as Opposition spokesman on social **security** which I think would detain the House if I read them.

* The results of debate will not always please everybody within the General Assembly or the **Security** Council.

* But only in very special **Security** Council cases are the United Nations decisions binding on member States.

* In the **Security** Council there is a further protection of the veto power which may be exercised by the United States of America, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom and China.

* I remember well the times when the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  after the previous Government had announced details of pension increases in the budget, would describe the then Government as mean and miserable men.

* There would not be any real **security** except perhaps sub-mortgages on real estate.

* Apart from food and clothing the 2 greatest needs of a pensioner are decent accommodation at a reasonable price and some **security** against the illnesses which inevitably come with old age.

* My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* No doubt he is aware of the comment in the Auditor-General's report that $ 19.8m in social **security** benefits was overpaid during the past year.

* Is the Minister able to say what action the Minister responsible and the Department of Social **Security** will take to see that this waste of taxpayers ' funds is not repeated in the future?

* But I am forced to allude to the question of **security** itself because this Government has in reality neglected Australia's **security**.

* Of course, a foreign policy should be concerned with more than **security**.

* But a foreign policy which neglects **security** is irresponsible.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
My concern is to see that Australian workers are fully employed.

* But any changes contemplated or suggested by the Board or by any other interests should not be allowed to destroy the basic principle underlying tariff policy in this country, and that is the establishment and the development of Australian industries manufacturing our raw materials and providing work and employment and **security** for Australian workers.

* It is one of the methods used by the Government to help to ensure the achievement of its national objectives, namely, economic growth and national **security**, increasing work force including migration, full employment, rising standards of living.

* The Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who represents the electorate adjacent to mine, and I have had the pleasure of opening many social **security** offices.

* A social **security** office will also be opened in the electorate of the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon).

* The existing provisions of the Act are very restrictive and relate to fixed deposits, Commonwealth securities or loans upon the **security** of the Commonwealth.

* Last night just before the adjournment debate I made the declaration that a tap had been placed on the private telephone of  Mr Justice  Staples by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* When he was the Attorney-General, one Thursday night after the Senate adjourned he decided to go to the headquarters of ASIO in Canberra with  Mr Kerry  Milte and Maureen Barron to have a talk about concern that was being expressed by the Commonwealth Police regarding the **security** of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, who was expected to arrive in Canberra within a few days time.

* The program has been kept under close review since then, and has been the subject of specific evaluation by the Department of Social **Security** including careful scrutiny by the homeless persons advisory committees established in each State.

* A report on the process of evaluation, entitled 'A Place of Dignity' was tabled by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on 9 June 1978.

* The Government's claim that the increased expenditure on social **security** will improve social **security** benefits and welfare services is simply untrue.

* It returns us to the old Liberal belief that social **security** means doling out money- and less money at that.

* This Government would have us believe that the sole test of our prosperity, the sole measure of our personal welfare and **security**, and the sole limit of our individual aspirations, is in having money in our pockets.

* If a Minister is in the know all the time- as was clearly the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  on the actual status of efficiency of the Narcotics Bureau; as has been the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  over the actual status of the prosecution of the Greeks; as have been  Senator Guilfoyle, Senator Durack  amd the Minister for Administrative Services  (Mr John McLeay)  over the cover-up relating to the Nakis pardon and the proposal for ex gratia payments- then the strict principle of ministerial responsibility should apply.

* These are: The Narcotics Bureau, which has been demolished, the Commonwealth Police scandal which is not a Greek conspiracy but rather a conspiracy of Compol against the Greek community which has resulted in the Commonwealth Police being discredited, and the damage done to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation last week with the tabling of  Mr Justice  Hope's report on **security** arrangements in the country.

* We have an internal **security** agency which is seriously damaged by the latest disclosures and the latest criticisms by  Mr Justice  Hope as to the way in which it operates.

* So, we have a law and order government headed by the Prime Minister who is easily the most obsessive of any man I have seen in this Parliament where the matters of **security** and law and order are concerned.

* We have a law and order government which is incapable, in its three areas of administration of law and order and internal **security**, of maintaining the functioning of effective, credible and respective institutions.

* More than that, a very large number of Greeks had their social **security** benefits suspended at least while these charges were proceeding.

* Lanigan, the head of the Department of Social **Security**, claims that he told  Senator Guilfoyle  of the reward offer at the time of these matters.

* In the Senate, this is the sort of evasion she attempts when she is asked about a meeting with Lanigan and others on 15 September 1977 at which it was decided, apparently, that a note in the form of a 'ministerial' be sent to her as an assessment for recommendations on whether any reward should be paid for evidence in the alleged social **security** fraud case.

* When asked a question in the Senate she said: 
The third matter concerns the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation which, once again, has been exposed as a totally defective institution.

* The Protective **Security** Report of Justice Hope said a number of things.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
) Expenditure by the Department of Social **Security** (and its predecessor, the Department of Social Services) on welfare is shown in the following table: 
-My question, which is directed to the acting Acting Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister, follows on the question I asked him as Acting Foreign Minister alone yesterday about the visit of a Government member to Rhodesia on the way to a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

* I ask: Is it a fact that **Security** Council resolutions over the last 10 years have made mandatory calls upon member 
**Security**, upon notice: 
The social justice of this Budget is evident right through it.

* Millions of people will have their dignity restored and their **security** made more secure and upgraded.

* The Opposition parties, clothed in the **security** of their new Leader, decided to adopt a more constructive approach.

* I wish to deal also with matters relating to the Government's failure to provide adequate **security** and surveillance against Taiwanese poaching in our northern waters.

* Finally, I wish to raise the question of the Government's miserable and heartless penny-pinching social **security** policy, observing only the letter of the law at the expense of the spirit of the Social **Security** Act, thus penalising and victimising the weak, the aged, the crippled, and even the spastics.

* His  parents told me that his invalid pension had been reduced by the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has been unable to see me this week to discuss the matter of Tony Freeman and all those other cripples and chronic invalid pensioners who have contacted my office in the last few days.

* If the Government had any intention of helping the unemployed, it would first have agreed to lift the level of extra allowable weekly income for unemployed people from $6 to $20 as is allowed for other recipients of social **security** benefits.

* The 1979-80 Budget has further widened the gap between single unemployment beneficiaries and other social **security** beneficiaries.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Is it a fact that under the present rules for unemployment benefit when a person leaves a job of his own accord, and without a good reason, the Department of Social **Security** has the power to suspend the benefit for a period of up to 6 weeks.

* The general majority of women cannot command an income capable of supporting a family, give them adequate housing and **security**, and then in addition face long hours of domestic work and supporting activities with their children out of school hours.

* He was the Minister for Social **Security**.

* He presided over social **security** during the important period of Labor's three-year term when social welfare benefits and costs rose from $2,099.7m to $5,077.4m and when the Commonwealth taxpayers' expenditure on health rose from $783.2m to $2,952.7m.

* Under Article II of the **Security** Treaty concluded in September 1951 between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America (the ANZUS Treaty) the parlies undertake separately and jointly to maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.

* These projects are considered to assist in some way the defensive posture of the US and to express the desire of the 2 countries to co-operate further in collective defence and for the preservation of peace and **security**.

* As my predecessor indicated in the House of Representatives on 29th April 1969, the precise details of the activities of the 2 latter stations are covered by **security**.

* Measures are taken by way of **security** fences, notices and patrols by traffic officers to prevent access of unauthorised persons to aircraft movement areas of main airports.

* The airlines also have their own quite comprehensive **security** arrangements as they are responsible for **security** measures in their own apron and hangar areas.

* The New South Wales Council for the Aging is subsidised by the Department of Social **Security**.

* This will need co-operation between the Department of Health and other government departments such as the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development and Treasury.

* That this House, noting that no advice has been provided to the Government that for **security** reasons it should purchase two Boeing 707, 149 passenger international airliners for use by the Prime Minister on his frequent safaris abroad, and which have twice the capacity of the Air Niugini international airline, is of the opinion that: 
As my colleague the honourable member for St George says, it is lies.

* I contacted the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to have this matter clarified.

* In order to clarify this matter, I contacted the Minister for Social **Security**.

* We recommend that Government act to determine several matters: The most effective **security** strategy; capabilities needed to execute that strategy; deficiencies in our present capabilities; and what is required to make good any such deficiencies.

* The development of the Defence Force should be based on a deterrent posture to show that the cost of interference with Australia or her vital interests would be prohibitive and should seek to demonstrate that Australia is concerned to contribute to the **security** of the region.

* The Committee agrees with the introduction to the 1976 White Paper on Defence which stated: 
The first responsibility of government is to provide the nation with **security** from armed attack and from the constraints on independent national decisions imposed by the threat of such attack.

* Everyone has the right to life, liberty and the **security** of person.

* Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social **security** and is entitled to realization through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.

* Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.

* For example, in December 1963 the **Security** Council made the following urgent request: 
It emerges from the evidence that Deputy John Marie Seroney, Vice-Speaker of the Parliament, was arrested on15 October 1975, in the precincts of Parliament.

* He has been detained since then without charges and without having been brought before a court, under the provisions of the Preservation of Public **Security** Act.

* Referring to the provisions of Chapter V of the Constitution of Kenya relating to the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens and particularly Article 83 thereof which sets limits to derogations which may be brought into operation under the Preservation of Public **Security** Act; Section 3 of the Kenya National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act; the provisions of Articles 2(1) and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ratified by Kenya on 1 May 1972), and the provisions of Articles 9, 11(1) and 1 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
My question is for the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I can say to the honourable member that at the time I was Foreign Minister we drafted a number of the documents as a basis on which thinking could proceed, firstly as to the special question of whether there could be the requisite majority and, secondly, to ensure that a permanent seat in the United Nations **Security** Council was voted to the People's Republic of China while sustaining the position of Taiwan in the General Assembly.

* But on or about 17 Februaryagain I think that this is tremendously important- he made the statement that America's commitment to Thailand's **security** under the Manila pact was assured.

* The appropriations for the Attorney-General 's Department provide for an increase in the allocation for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation of just under $900,000 or 7.

* In the appropriations for the Department of Social **Security** there is provision for a reduction in grants to homeless persons organisations of $1.9m or 48.7 per cent.

* It must be very worrying for them in their old age and in their retirement to have to be concerned about **security** and the cost of living.

* Then they would not have to worry about lobbying members of Parliament, writing to newspapers and getting themselves het up at a time when they should be able to live in relaxation and **security**, certain that they will be able to continue to enjoy the standard of living they had in the past.

* Going to the substance of clause 39- and I will do so in only one or two minutes- in the original section of the Banking Act these powers to make regulations are made explicit in relation to currency, **security** and goods, and, the section concerns the powers of appeal.

* **Security** for compensation cases to undertake rehabilitation vocational training using the rehabilitation service of the Department of Social **Security**.

* It is an amount determined by the Director-General of Social **Security** that does not exceed  25  per cent of the weighted average weekly minimum wage appropriate to the person's age.

* b) No additional airport terminal **security** staff have been appointed by my Department at Australia's international airports since 1 February 1979.

* Exemption under item 135a in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act for a motor vehicle for use in his transportation to and from gainful employment is available to a person who has been certified by the Director-General of Social **Security**, or an officer appointed by him for the purpose, to have lost the use of one or both legs to such an extent that he is permanently unable to use public transport.

* The main point that worries me is this: On what basis is information on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation given to the Leader of the Opposition?

* They may be required for social **security** or tax purposes.

* They may be required for travelling in a country or for internal **security** purposes.

* As I said in my earlier answer to the right honourable member (Hansard, 31 October 1974, P. 3259), the present government has set up a Royal Commission of Inquiry into Intelligence and **Security** Services of the Australian Government, the terms of reference of which provide for recommendations to be made as to the procedures that should be introduced to permit review of administrative decisions affecting citizens which were, or may have been, based on reports of an adverse kind furnished by the **security** and intelligence services of the Government.

* So under this Government not only do workers receive less wages but the **security** of their jobs is less as well.

* 1 understand it is a plank of the Labor Party's defence platform adopted at the Launceston Conference that it would retain the 'right to raise a national service force should the **security** of Australia be threatened'.

* One would have expected an alternative government to adopt a more responsible attitude to the need for continuing defence of national **security** and to ensure that it was, in fact, achieving strong forces through the measures it would take to attract volunteers before it placed our defence interests in jeopardy.

* The essential issue is one of defence preparedness 
Investors including foreign investors in recent times have not had the opportunity, to invest with any sense of **security** consequently the rate of foreign investment, especially in terms of private capital investment, nas fallen substantially from $600m in 1971-72 to minus $106m in 1973-74.

* Some people think that Customs officers, police officers and **security** officers should not be able to gather irrelevant information.

* Officers charged with the responsibility of enforcing the law, whether it be the customs law, ordinary law or **security** law, are then able to identify people who are in breach of the law.

* There has been a considerable improvement in the **security** in most areas of South Vietnam.

* However, the Australian Task Force still maintains the **security** and operational requirements in some of the more remote areas.

* In the very near future, the South Vietnamese will be taking over completely the **security** of Phuoc Tuy Province.

* That submission expresses the view, based on much sounder evidence than the evidence on which the uranium lobbyists base their arguments, that the waste problem, the **security** problem, can be solved.

* If there is a power crisis we need to develop this alternative which is, I repeat, more promising than nuclear power because it is cleaner, cheaper and much better proved than the technology to cope with nuclear power waste disposal and **security** for which we are still waiting.

* Already an air of disillusionment assails those who, but a few short years ago, were confident in their own sense of **security**.

* I think I am right in saying that if the honourable member for Hotham looks at his speech tomorrow he will realise that he did not appreciate what the Minister for Social **Security** stated when he said that there will be a rise in autumn.

* Surely this is the distinguishing characteristic of the servile state where the processes of law and justice are conducted in secret without any regard to **security** matters in the strict sense.

* I believe that at no stage while he has been Minister, or at any other stage, has the information divulged by the Minister for Social Services, as he was, or by the present Minister for Social **Security**, reacted against the pensioner.

* It is my belief that over the course of the years it has been necessary for some divulgence of information to be part and parcel of the holding of information within a department such as the Department of Social **Security**.

* I should hope that people who are pensioners do not feel that the results of the steps taken by the present Minister for Social **Security** will react to their disadvantage.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 August 1979: 
For what programs and policies concerning immigrants has the Department of Social **Security** been responsible in each year from 1970 to date.

* On what dates did the transfer of responsibility for programs and policies referred to in part ( 1 ) to or from the Department of Social **Security** take effect.

* With what other Federal or State Government Departments or authorities does the Department of Social **Security** share responsibility for the programs and policies referred to in part (1).

* It was claimed that I had issued a directive to the Department of Social **Security** not to extend invitations to members of the medical profession to attend openings of the Medibank offices in the capital cities.

* It seems incredible that the Government should have been unaware that more than 65 000 people were receiving social **security** hand-outs to which they were not entitled.

* I did note that the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  expressed concern that this Bill would remove from the public servant the **security** of tenure of his or her position or his or her insulation from pressures that the Government might bring to bear on his or her employment.

* It is not only a matter of **security** of tenure.

* This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure that, as far as possible, passports are not issued to persons who are likely to threaten the national **security** and public order of another country, or the rights and welfare of its citizens.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 June 1977: 
1 ) What is the name and classification of each officer of the Department of Social **Security** who travelled overseas or is scheduled to travel overseas during the periods (a) II November 1975 to 30 June 1976 and (b) I July 1976 to 30 June 1977 on duties associated with (i) overseas visits by the Prime Minister, (ii) overseas visits by the Minister, (iii) overseas visits by any other Ministers and (iv) overseas visits for any other purpose.

* What charges were made against the estimates for the Department of Social **Security** in respect of each of those officers under the categories listed in pan ( I ) by way of (a) cost of travel.

* I also want to complain about the bad practice of  Senator Wheeldon,  the Minister for Social **Security** and Minister for Repatriation and Compensation, of not replying himself to letters written to him.

* Senator Wheeldon  referred the letter to  Mr Daniels,  the DirectorGeneral of the Department of Social **Security**, for his reply.

* I believe that this is unfair to the Director-General of Social **Security** because he is forced to reply to letters which, let us say, may have a political content, when he is a senior civil servant.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I would be very concerned if genuine applicants for unemployment relief were kept waiting for any considerable period.

* I will ask the Minister for Social **Security** to examine the matter.

* This applies especially to the Department of Social **Security** which has a particular task that obviously is of great importance to a very large number of individuals and families at present.

* If so, I think it is important that the reasons for that opposition are made known to us, especially if those reasons have to do with the **security** or the capacity of the defence forces to carry out their likely functions in Australia and if their capabilities are in any way reduced by that commitment, or if the forces themselves are in any way likely to be placed in danger because of the structure of the force which is being committed.

* I believe that the Parliament and the people of Australia are entitled also to know the arguments advanced against the commitment, especially if those arguments relate to Australia 's **security**.

* Does the Prime Minister recall being asked questions shortly after his Government came into office concerning **security** clearance for the staff of Ministers, ensuring that both international **security** and confidentiality of Government files were maintained?

* Does he recall that no clear answer was given as to whether or not he would insist on all Ministers' staffs being cleared for **security**?

* I ask him whether he recalls telling me in answer to a question: 
All that I am aware of is that my staff, the staff of my  Deputy  and the staff of the Ministers who assist us-  Senator Willesee  and  Senator Bishop-  have had the full **security** clearances which apply to our portfolios.

* Minister whether, in view of his apparent reluctance to insist on **security** clearance of Ministers' staffs, he will, as Prime Minister, accept full responsibility for any breach of **security** or scandal that occurs?

* It is the Government's intention, by using an active manpower policy, not only to maintain full employment but to ensure **security** of employment.

* I talk of the Italian organisation called FILEF (Federation of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families) which until this year had been serving a purpose which the present Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said was valuable among Italian migrant workers in Melbourne.

* When he reached the age of 70 years he was refused Australian citizenship on the ground that he was a **security** risk.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in his second reading speech quite rightly said that the special levy of 5 per cent was originally introduced last September to apply for a period from 2 September 1974 to 30 June 1975.

* The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the Act to be amended so that under section 41 a mining authority can be issued for rnining at Ranger which affords the persons on whom the authority has been conferred **security** of tenure- which is most important- similar to that enjoyed by the holders of a mining lease in force in the Northern Territory and most of the States, while at the same time assuring that it is subject to appropriate controls.

* The Government believes that the holders of an authority under the Atomic Energy Act should not be disadvantaged in respect of such an important matter as **security** of tenure in comparison with prospective competitors.

* I believe that the formation of an independent Australia Council will inaugurate a new era of vitality and progress in the arts, that creative artists of all kinds will enjoy a new measure of **security** and status in the community and that the Australian people as a whole will have new and wider opportunities to participate in the arts and enjoy the emotional, spiritual and intellectual rewards which the arts alone can provide.

* Our whole economy and our national **security** will be placed at risk because of the necessity to meet a huge bill for the import of foreign oil.

* Secondly, the cost of interest currently averaging 1 1V4 per cent on a daily basis is set so high on an average loan of $20,000 that prospects of servicing a loan and interest at that rate are outside the resources of all but those who have job **security** and a higher than average weekly wage.

* They are set to provide maximum **security** on health standards, electrical wiring and for other regulations such as fire control.

* Has that action adversely affected Australia's standing abroad or our **security**?

* Will the new **security** check ensure that the same improprieties do not occur again or is it a fact that the new **security** check in no way relates to past domestic, financial or business dealings?

* What was the (a) establishment and (b) number of officers in service at each Commonwealth airport for duties associated with airport **security** as at (i) 31 March 1979 and (ii) 30 April 1979.

* The communications made available to me had already been given **security** classifications by the originators and I do not believe that tabling would be either appropriate or useful.

* A report on the **security** service took some years to prepare.

* Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill 1979: 
The second essential point I make concerns continuity of policy.

* We will maintain the **security** of this country by developing selfsufficient and versatile armed forces.

* The establishment (a) and number of officers (b) of the Department of Transport who perform duties associated with airport **security** were, at both 31 March 1979 and 30 April 1979: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) What levels, classes and grades of the Australian Public Service are denied access to the Australian Government **Security** Handbook.

* It is in the field of social **security**; it is where pensioners are concerned.

* I think that every time they stand and speak of cuts in government spending they make the recipients of social **security** feel uneasy and threatened.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 27 April 1977: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) Instructions to officers of the Department of Social **Security** state: 
I have only a few moments so I will conlude my remarks on this statement by emphasising as strongly as I can that there will be no hope for world peace unless we can strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to intervene in international disputes, despite the obstruction of the five permanent members of the **Security** Council, most of whom represent only a small proportion of the people on this planet.

* I want to stress that I think that the present structure of the **Security** Council is a monstrous gerrymander.

* With the attainment of self-government in Papua New Guinea Australia will still look after defence and foreign affairs but there is the matter of internal **security**.

* It wants to throw that Government on to the international arena as far as foreign affairs, defence, internal **security** and currency are concerned.

* I refer, for example, to internal **security**.

* We believe that it is more appropriate for an Office of Child Care to be established under the Minister for Social **Security**, as part of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I am sure that if the honourable member for Oxley had still been the Minister for Social **Security** or Treasurer he would have been seeking to impose a levy in one way or another to try to recover some costs to pay for health care in Australia.

* In the meantime I look forward to discussing the matter with my counterpart State Ministers and I am sure that we will be able to report in the Budget session a far more practical and sensible agreement which is based upon proper legal terms in respect of the modified Medibank proposals and which will provide health **security** to the Australian people.

* Such a refusal must be backed by the certificate of a Minister furnished to the Ombudsman certifying that the disclosure of information concerning a specified matter would be contrary to the public interest because it would prejudice the **security**, defence or international relations of Australia, relations between the Australian Government and the government of a State, or that it would involve the disclosure of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or of a committee of the Cabinet, or that it would involve the disclosure of deliberations of the Administrator's Council of the Northern Territory.

* The Ombudsman is given **security** of tenure.

* We are arguing that those opinions about the nature of advice to be given by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to a Minister, a department or authority of the Commonwealth, are matters of general moment as distinct from - 
My predecessors have not placed on record a general description of Australian consular functions and services, and although there are some difficulties of definition, I believe it would be helpful to do so.

* The first requires that Australian consular officers perform functions including the following: Notarial acts, oaths, affirmations and declarations such as the authentication or legalisation of various documents, from wills and contracts to school certificates and driving licences; the issue and renewal of passports and visas; the solemnisation and registration of marriages; payment of or advice on social **security** provisions including medical benefits; advice on the importation and registration of motor vehicles; advice on acquisition or loss of citizenship, particulary on dual nationality problems; provision of information on Australian Customs' requirements; the provision of facilities for voting in Australian elections overseas; the administration of regulations arising from the Navigation Act in regard to seamen; liaison with overseas legal authorities on instructions from Australia to arrange extradition; advice on exchange control and currency matters for personal or investment purposes; serving of writs and taking evidence; advising visitors to Australia of health and quarantine requirements and reporting on outbreaks of diseases in foreign countries.

* We must have the means to respond to an anxious parent in search of a missing child, to a pensioner whose social **security** benefits have been erroneously held up or in the aftermath of a disaster involving Australian citizens overseas.

* We offer this unequivocal opposition fully conscious of the political consequences of such an act - and I refer to the repeated threats of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that the political consequences of opposition to this scheme wll be a double dissolution.

* Improvements in social **security** and welfare, if not always parsimonious, under the previous Government often had a tinge of reluctance about them.

* On social **security** benefits we are doing what we said we would do - an increase of $1.50 twice a year.

* A budget that sets out to achieve the welfare and the best objectives for the individual will be a budget which proves that at a government level the **security** of those individuals has best been effected.

* For some time the Australian community has been looking for **security** and a sense of well-being.

* The well-being of the community is established by a sense of **security**.

* A sense of **security** is reflected in all walks of life.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has claimed that but for the double dissolution nursing home benefits would have been increased earlier.

* The Federal Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  recently announced the Government's intention to double building subsidies under the Aged Persons Homes Act, bringing the new subsidy to $4 for every SI spent on buildings for the aged.

* At yesterday's briefing the Minister distributed a lengthy paper on the DDL destroyer couched in descriptive and analytical terms; it did not contain any material of a **security** nature.

* However, it is far from clear how the Navy should be equipped and deployed in the most effective way to assure the **security** of the Australian continent.

* For the information of honourable members I present the annual report of the Australian Department of Social **Security** for the financial year ended 30 June 1975.

* Notwithstanding the statements of the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  we must remember that in October 1974 the present Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  moved an amendment to an Australian Labor Party Bill seeking to ensure that what is now being done would be done.

* He was supported by the Prime Minister, the present Minister for Social **Security**, the honourable member for Murray and now by other newcomers in the Parliament, particularly the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Goodluck).

* For instance, the honourable member for Hotham, the Opposition spokesman on social **security** matters, has suggested that Medibank would be totally dismantled.

* One of the reasons why article 6 was written into the United Nations Charter was that members of the United Nations which have persistently violated the principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled by the General Assembly upon the recommendations of the **Security** Council.

* In the **Security** Council, of which Australia is a member, the Australian delegation has been instructed to vote for the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations.

* The Jubilee Road Primary School at Wallsend urgently needs a new library, increased staff accommodation, a work preparation room for the teachers aide and **security** lighting.

* Whilst their economic influence in our region remains very Strong there can be no argument, in my view, that the absolute military **security** which they once presented for us is no longer there.

* It was proposed by the then Minister for Social **Security**, the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  that $14m would be spent in the first three years.

* Let us look at the second reading speech of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  who represents the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in this House.

* On 14 September 1976 the United States Ambassador to the United Nations,  Mr William  Scranton, announced that he had been directed to use his veto at the **Security** Council to prevent Vietnam's admission to membership in the United Nations if a request for admission were put to the vote.

* I suggest that Crown privilege should be limited as much as possible to those cases where there is a genuine **security** problem or the more serious aspects of the need for Crown privilege.

* Its extension to the social **security** area will be very welcomed by the public at large, and that would cut both ways.

* What was constructive about supplementing, putting down, covering up or ignoring **security** as a basic element in foreign policy?

* It also dealt with central issues of power, national interest and **security**.

* Part 4 of the 1953 Act, which dealt with **security**, detailed a large number of restrictions on people, including access to and use of information, and the right of defensive action on the part of a person accused of trespassing, sabotage, breaking confidentiality and other unlawful activities under the Act.

* It is being used to give the Commission power to issue **security** to raise $24m as a first instalment of the Government's commitment to the Ranger project.

* This publication has been distributed by the Department of Social **Security**.

* I think the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  would be the first to agree that in asking the Parliament to pass this Bill he is asking it to take him and his Commission on trust.

* Theoretically, a council will have to work in liaison with the Australian Department of Social **Security** or the State offices of it and up to 13 other Australian Government departments, such as Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney-Generals', Capital Territory, Education, Environment and Conservation, Health, Housing, Immigration, Labour, Northern Territory, Repatriation, Tourism and Recreation and Urban and Regional Development; the State Government in its various departments concerned with welfare services; local governments - there are 900 of them; the Australian Council of Social Services and the State Council of Social Services; various planning boards in existence and to be set up; and local bodies and charities concerned with welfare services.

* So we have given to the market much more **security** than it ever had before.

* We have given it the sort of **security** that previous governments, have never been able to provide.

* Many other agricultural industries would envy the **security** that this scheme will be bringing into wool marketing.

* The service, which began in July 1948, is conducted by the Department of Social **Security** as part of its responsibility for administration of the Social Services Act.

* In brief, the amendments we are proposing to Part VIII of the Act will enable the Department of Social **Security** to offer the very successful rehabilitation treatment and training programs of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to all classes of severely disabled persons within the broad working age group who would benefit substantially from such assistance.

* The Social **Security** Act will assist with the pressing needs of those who remain, provided they can meet the means test.

* All others are left to fend for themselves.. 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Government of the United States being resolved to devote its efforts to the strengthening of peace in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations takes note of the agreements concluded at Geneva on 20th July and 2 1st July 1954 between (a) the Franco-Laotian Command and the Command of the Peoples Army of VietNam; (b) the Royal Khmer Army Command and the Command of the Peoples Army of Viet-Nam; (c) Franco-Vietnamese Command and the Command of the Peoples Army of Viet-Nam and of paragraphs 1 to 12 inclusive of the declaration presented to the Geneva Conference on 21st July 1954 declares with regard to the aforesaid agreements and paragraphs that (i) it will refrain from the threat or the use of force to disturb them, in accordance with Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations dealing with the obligation of members to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force; and (ii) it would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of the aforesaid agreements with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace and **security**.

* I wish to make one or two comments in reply to the speeches that have been made which serve perhaps to emphasise the comments which have been made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in debate in the Senate and in the second reading speech in this House.

* Whenever public funds are to be spent on any sector of the community, whether by way of social **security** transfers, subsidy to industry or indirectly by way of tariff protection, the community has a right to demand that such a use of public funds should be justified in terms of the contribution to the community's objectives.

* I would like to refer to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  because he has been guilty of 2 breaches of parliamentary practice in this regard.

* I come back to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I, for my part, indicated that we recognised that much of the concern by the Japanese to seek substantial investment participation in Australia was as a means of ensuring their **security** in the supply of agricultural, industrial and mineral raw materials.

* From 10 February 1975 to 29 February 1976, 5349 appeals were lodged against the termination of social **security** benefits.

* 1 12 0.00 beneficiaries were selected for visits- by the field officers of the Department of Social **Security** and that as a result of those visits 30 per cent of the cases had their benefits terminated.

* In addition life insurance companies paid loans on mortgage and loans on **security** of policies amounting to $284,000 in Papua New Guinea in 1970-71.

* The first plank of this Government's platform is the **security** of the nation.

* In considering foreign affairs we have to recognise that there is new thinking in Asian countries which amounts to a questioning or, in some cases, a rejection of the belief that the **security** of individual nations can be protected and national interests promoted on the basis of the alignment of the great powers and the cold war style of confrontation and the containment of communism.

* In most cases it has complicated national **security** problems rather than offered solutions to them.

* Government but its paramount concern has been to determine whether Australian **security** has been endangered, whether communist objectives have been advanced and what defence, measures should be taken to deter a possible threat.

* More purposeful steps should be taken to acquire a deeper understanding of these countries and their problems and to participate with them in their search for greater co-operation, such as a search for a system of collective **security** which would obviate the need for heavy defence expenditure.

* After all, our **security** can never be wholly assured while our neighbours are enduring political instability.

* In per capita terms Australia should be setting the pace in the challenging task of seeking to overcome one of the most serious threats to world **security** - the widening gap between rich and poor countries.

* If we did this Australian **security** and commercial interests would be improved.

* Collective **security** and neutralisation proposals are presently under constant discussion in most South East Asian capitals, but the few Australian statements on the subject have been restrained, at times even sceptical.

* Statements have been made that we must develop northern Australia because its comparative emptiness is a threat to our **security**.

* Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
That the fruit acquired by the Authority be part of the **security** offered for advances from the Rural Credit Department of the Reserve Bank of Australia and that this **security** be supported by a guarantee by the Tasmanian Government if this is required.

* He has called on the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to give an assurance that this particular scheme will not be jettisoned or adversely affected by the Budget cuts that are being contemplated.

* We read today that there is a secret report from the Income **Security** Review Commission and it is contended that this legislation is under threat through the recommendations of that Commission.

* and (S) The **security** of weapons and **security** procedures in general are subject to continuing examination.

* I did instruct that there be a comprehensive review of the present **security** facilities provided so that I could be reassured on this important matter.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  pointed out recently, they amount to $40m in one instance.

* But in case there is a lingering desire to debate this issue on the part of the Opposition let me remind members of the Opposition of the shocking degree of intrusion into personal records held by the Department of Social **Security** which I uncovered in the latter part of last year.

* That philosophy is supported by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and others in the Cabinet.

* It is right for the economic **security** and viability of this region.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has been called a murderer.

* Irrigation gives to primary industry a **security** which cannot be obtained in any other way.

* The building of this dam will give us great **security** as far as irrigation is concerned.

* It will further protect Canada's **security** interests by permitting Canada to exercise greater control over the movement of foreign ships.

* The House therefore resolves that the matter be referred to the Royal Commission on **Security** and Intelligence with extended terms of reference and time to report to determine the extent of the knowledge of the former Government of the events in regard to East Timor prior to its dismissal from office.

* These are the ones who for the first time have some hope of **security** under this legislation and who will be able to obtain compensation for their incapacity.

* While the rate of increase in government expenditure has been cut, government expenditure on social **security** and welfare has increased by 23 per cent.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 May 1978: 
1 ) How many cases have come to the attention of the Department of Social **Security** of families who have been forced to sell their homes which were being purchased by bank and building society mortgages, because of working wives losing their jobs, and in particular, can the Minister give the numbers in the western suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney.

* Has the Department of Social **Security** considered any schemes of income support or low interest loans similar to war service loans, which could be made to bona fide cases to preserve these families in their own homes; if so, what action is proposed.

* What we have sought is to achieve self-management for those communities and also, when the reserve lands which had been set aside for those communities were abolished, **security** of that land for their traditional rights and their rights of use and occupation which they had enjoyed for so long.

* We recognise present negotiations with Queensland Government at a delicate stage but respect your assurances that your Government will act to ensure that Aurukun and Mornington Island people gain the selfmanagement and **security** of land that they so earnest seek.

* There is no difference between leasehold land and freehold land as far as the **security** of tenure of the property built on it is concerned.

* If a person has a house in his name and the title to the land in his name his **security** of tenure to his house is the same irrespective of whether he holds the land in fee simple or leasehold.

* There is a very great need for some **security** in all avenues of primary industry.

* The beef industry is a very difficult industry to provide with the **security** that has been given to the wool industry and indeed to other industries because of the peculiarities of the beef industry such as the storage of a perishable product compared with say wool, wheat or sugar for that matter.

* The problem of providing price **security** in the beef industry is one which has caused very great concern, but I am pleased that the wool industry has received the benefits that this scheme provides with a guaranteed floor price as has been mentioned tonight.

* It was necessary to encourage them to see the wisdom of putting their money into housing rather than motor cars or something else that would not in the long run produce for them the **security** of a home or the opportunity to have a home of their own and to get away from the very thing which over the years the Labor Party had advocated - a situation in which too many people were renting homes; too many people did not have a stake in the country and did not have a home they could call their own.

* As he said, who rules in Saigon is not and never has been an ingredient in Australia's **security**.

* Our strength- our **security**- rests on factors and relationships ultimately unrelated to these events.

* Many minorities have been provided for at long last and the philosophy of this was evident in the report tabled by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  this afternoon.

* The premises for such a policy also include: That get big or get out is inadequate as a policy for all farmers; that there is no once and for all size of farm business likely to ensure all time viability; that drought, flood and other natural disasters should attract realistic, not confused, financial assistance; that the welfare needs of rural communities and towns must be accurately perceived in social terms separate from handouts; that society, through government, has the responsibility to ensure employment opportunities for every man to earn or to have a minimum income but not to guarantee every man **security** in the occupation of his choice.

* What was happening in that country obviously was of importance not only to our country, our sphere of influence and our **security**.

* Highly specialised and sophisticated engineering systems- for example, mechanical, electrical and hydraulic services- will be installed to cope with the stringent design criteria of microbiological **security** to specified areas.

* The Committee concluded that there was a need for the faculty, that the proposal was economically justified, that the 'box within a box' principle of design of the laboratory will ensure microbiological **security**, that the proposed functions of the laboratory are appropriate, that the precautions taken to prevent the escape of infectious disease viruses have been based on and are an improvement on measures which have been successful in a number of similar laboratories overseas, that after a suitable period the laboratory should be authorised to handle the foot and mouth disease virus prior to an outbreak of the disease in this country, that the site is suitable and that the work should proceed to construction.

* 3893 include reference to aviation **security**, and these officers are available for full-time aviation **security** duties if particular circumstances warrant.

* The Party's monopoly of political power derives considerable support from Soviet **security** agencies and from control of the Soviet media.

* Wide publicity tends to act as a **security** against greater Soviet excesses.

* This is not the time to assess what our military commitment in Vietnam has done to Australia and what impact it has had on the defence and **security** of this country.

* The Government spokesmen have their views on the level of **security** that has been achieved in South Vietnam.

* Flowing from the engagement last week, subsequent statements made by the Minister for Defence  (Mr Fairbairn)  and the Minister for the Army  (Mr Peacock),  and the answers given by the Minister for Defence to questions in the Parliament yesterday, the Opposition wants to look at the disposition of Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy Province and the **security** of their withdrawal.

* A picture was painted of the transformation of **security** in the Province as these territorial units grew in strength and gradually assumed increasing responsibility for the **security** of the Province.

* He said the operation had occurred because of the Australian responsibility for the **security** of approaches to populated areas and the Australian Task Force base.

* According to the Minister the Task Force still maintained the responsibility for **security** and operations in some of the more remote areas.

* The Minister for the Army defines Australian responsibility as the **security** of approaches to populated areas and the base at Nui Dat.

* It would not be a breach of **security** for either of these Ministers to state to the Parliament just what areas the South Vietnamese are responsible for and what areas the Australians still secure.

* The third point I want to raise on behalf of the Opposition is the **security** of the remaining forces during the  2  phases of withdrawal.

* The first phase will mean the withdrawal of the Fourth Battalion, remaining support units and a considerable amount of equipment through an area whose **security** is highly suspect.

* The problem remains of how to protect the 
There are other questions of **security** raised after the completion of withdrawal to Vung Tau.

* For these reasons the Opposition has raised this matter today to allow the Government to clarify confusing aspects of its Vietnam policy, and to reassure the Parliament and people on the **security** of Australian forces during the agonising months of withdrawal ahead.

* Australian **security** must be imperative; our forces must not be influenced by projections of what could happen in Phuoc Tuy after Australian forces leave forever.

* The Liberals have never remotely understood the depth of revulsion to racism among African and Asian peoples and the threat it poses to peace and **security** in Africa and throughout the world.

* This is a matter for the responsible Minister, the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Turning to recent events in the United Nations, I refer in particular to the expulsion of the Republic of China from and the introduction of the People's Republic of China to the General Assembly and the **Security** Council.

* It may be of interest to the honourable member for Hunter to note that Article 23 of the United Nations Charter, which defines the composition of the **Security** Council, states: 
The **Security** Council shall consist of fifteen Members of the United Nations.

* The Republic of China, France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America shall be permanent members of the **Security** Council.

* The General Assembly shall elect ten other Members of the United Nations to be nonpermanent members of the **Security** Council, due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and **security** and to the other purposes of the Organization, and also to equitable geographical distribution.

* I propose to look at one of the leading members of the **Security** Council engaged in the maintenance of international peace and to contrast the activities of that government and that country with the words in Article 23 of the United Nations Charter which I have just read to the Committee.

* Because the Russian Government took the view that this constituted a threat to the internal as well as to the external **security** of Russia, it is common knowledge that enormous military forces, backed by the full power of the Warsaw Pact, moved into Czechoslovakia.

* I turn to the recent admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations General Assembly and to the **Security** Council and refer to actions in Tibet into which the United Nations organisation itself carried out a complete inquiry.

* How will Peking behave in the **Security** Council and the General Assembly?

* They provide for pension increases in line with increases granted to social **security** pensioners.

* Student children are being recognised as dependants, similarly to the children of persons who are the recipients of social **security** benefits.

* Children will be recognised as dependants of -war pensioners as are the children of recipients of social **security** benefits.

* I consider this to be totally wrong and I am very pleased to see that this differentiation is not to be continued by either the Repatriation Department or the Department of Social **Security**.

* I hope that the negotiations between the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  and the Australian Medical Association may achieve some means by which these people can receive their entitlement.

* We cannot have **security** treaty arrangements unless those with whom we are partners know that we have and will maintain sufficient armed forces to honour those obligations.

* I suggest to you,  Sir, that  this Parliament is responsible for the laws under which the Commonwealth Police and other **security** organisations operate.

* I do not question whether the Commonwealth Police are acting properly or within their **security** functions; what I question is whether the rights and privileges of access to information of a member of this Parliament can be inhibited by the  knowledge that those persons who pass on information to a member of Parliament are under surveillance, can come under threat and cannot freely disclose information in private without the fear that that information may be passed on to political opponents or persons who could do them political damage.

* It was one of these advisers - being paid, I am told, $1,000 a day- who led the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  into his bundering raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  have sweeping visions of desirable changes in our society.

* Is it a fact that in a despatch of Press releases received by members on or about 30th January 1973 there were several pages of what appeared to be a transcript of an interview with either the Minister for Social **Security** or the Minister for Health which was without any heading or indication of who the questioner or answerer was.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I do not believe that there is a case to be referred to the Royal Commission.

* The honourable gentleman would know that the Royal Commission- he has been kept advised of its progress in a number of areas at my request- has been asked to advise on various **security** and intelligence arrangements that Australia either has or ought to have.

* When the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  brings forward his paper on foreign affairs, I for one will participate in the debate, and I believe that I will be able to show not only that the Leader of the Opposition is dangerous to the **security** of this country but that wherever he went on his recent overseas trip he created an impression which was bad for Australia and which brought him into ridicule.

* Yet his colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has repeated on a number of occasions in the House that it will not cost the taxpayer anything.

* They need to have an opportunity to have those misstatements corrected and they need to have the distortions that apparently occur in the interpretation of the health scheme by the Treasurer and those of the Minister for Social **Security**, reconciled.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Income **Security** Review falls within the responsibility of the Prime Minister- the  Chairman  of the Review is from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

* Will he also probe complaints against the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and senior officers of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission who are said to have engaged in a conspiracy against the Dalton family?

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has given outstanding and truthful statements to this Parliament.

* It will also demonstrate internationally our commitment to world food **security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* A new edition of the directory of Ethnic Organisations in Australia is currently in the process of being published by the Department of Social **Security** and this will soon be distributed free of charge to persons and organisations concerned with the well being of migrants.

* It would provide **security** for farmers but entail little government expenditure.

* It upsets them to go back to their electorate offices and to face their constituents who are out of work and who have had problems with the Department of Social **Security** because of the understating of and the staff ceiling applied to that Department and the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* Is the Minister for Health aware that the Australian Veterinary Association, the Commonwealth-States Veterinary Committee, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and university veterinary scientists have long requested the establishment of a maximum **security** veterinary laboratory so that research, specialisation, production of vaccines and diagnosis of exotic virus diseases of livestock may be undertaken?

* Is he aware that these bodies do not see as adequate the provision of only a high **security** import quarantine station at Norfolk Island or elsewhere?

* Is any investigation under way on the provision of a maximum **security** laboratory?

* If there is to be some **security** in parliamentary life, it has to be by way of monetary compensation not only to the member but also to the dependants.

* Because members make a contribution well in excess of normal requirements, it is appropriate that they be able to convert retiring allowances into lump sums which can be reinvested in a business or profession, or just invested, in order to gain some **security** in life.

* I commend the word 'acculturated' to the vocabulary of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The article continues: 
In concluding my remarks on the Bill that provides assistance for the homeless I commend to honourable members an article written in the Social **Security** Quarterly' of winter 1974- a publication of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Her  article states: 
Acceptance, which includes love, significance and **security**.

* That budget will be examined by the Department of Social **Security** for reasonableness, having regard to the costs of operating other nursing homes participating in the deficit financing arrangement and the past costs of the nursing home concerned.

* But I do point out the danger that, as soon as a nursing home applies to the Minister for Social **Security** for deficit financing, it naturally and automatically places itself in the hands of the Government as far as even administration, budgeting and the operation of the home are concerned.

* The Bill also gives enormous power to the permanent head of the Department of Social **Security** or his delegate.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch),  who as Minister for Labour and National Service in the last government specialised in creating unrest and sowing suspicion and distrust by reporting strikers to the police, has been talking of the need for circuit breakers and increasing social **security** benefits to control the economy.

* Equally presumably, the increased social **security** benefits are increased unemployment benefits for those unfortunate enough to be cast into unemployment by these sorts of policies.

* The only other benefit which they may be able to receive would be a pensioner health benefits card, issued to age and service pensioners by the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Veterans' Affairs respectively and which requires the veteran to satisfy a further income test.

* If a veteran is discharged from, or dies whilst in a benevolent home, the service pension will revert to the married rate, but in the majority of cases it will be to the widow's advantage to transfer to a social **security** pension.

* It sees **security** for many years.

* These are the words which they used in their 1974 report in contradistinction to the nonsense that has come from the Opposition benches: 
Defence expenditure as a percentage of the gross national product in a number of countries which are acutely aware of their responsibility to ensure national **security** but which at the same time, like ourselves, really have no aggressive intentions- and perhaps I should first of all point out that Australia's percentage is approximately 2.4 percent- are as follows: Canada 1.8 percent; 
A feature of Australia's defence situation which will continue to influence planning is her strong position in comparison with other nations in the South East Asian and Asian areas.

* Other nations in the area have not the industrial capacity or the industrial strength to sustain operations on the scale required to threaten Australia's **security**.

* In any consideration of defence one thinks of the fundamental principle that long term planning based upon a concept of the general **security** of the Australian mainland is the only basis which is sound.

* So are the requirements for prior Australian consent to high enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia and the requirement that adequate physical **security** be maintained on the nuclear industries of uranium importing countries.

* Has the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation taken any steps to investigate the activities and operations of the League of Rights.

* If so, have the investigations revealed anything that would be detrimental to the **security** of Australia.

* In the first place, the new program could not be described as socialised medicine but merely represents the attempt of the Labor Government to update this aspect of our social **security** in line with the standards of the second half of the 20th century.

* Just about every developed country in the world - and some developing countries, too - have adopted comprehensive, universal health insurance as part of their social **security** systems.

* Dedicated men in this field have been and still are making great personal sacrifices to preserve the safety and **security** of the individual in society.

* Under its control is the Australian Capital Territory Police Force, the Commonwealth Police Force, the Northern Territory Police Force, the New Guinea and Papuan Police Force, the Narcotics Bureau, the Customs and Excise officers and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* He applied for assistance to the Department of Social **Security** and received a benefit until the Commonwealth Commissioner finally agreed to accept liability for his claim.

* Of course he had been receiving social **security** payments before that.

* After it was agreed that the Commonwealth Compensation Commissioner would accept liability an adjustment was made between the amount the employee had received in social **security** benefits and the amount that he was entitled to as compensation.

* There was a lot of correspondence between the Commonwealth Railways- now the Australian National Railways- and the Department of Social **Security** to calculate the amount.

* Finally, after 20 months he received an adjustment which was the difference between the amount he had received in social **security** payments and the amount he was entitled to as compensation because of lost wages during the 20 months involved.

* Honourable members opposite tolerated for so long the widespread abuse of and intrusion into the personal records of people in the Department of Social **Security**.

* It states: 
That the Attorney-General lacks the confidence of the House because he deliberately misled it while purporting to give it official information in his position as Attorney-General and as MinisterinCharge of **security** when, as he subsequently admitted, his statement was based solely on a report which appeared in the Communist newspaper 'Tribune', and which even then he quoted incorrectly.

* Certainly from the point of view of national **security** we have to have an opportunity at times to come in on a conversation providing we get the permission of the AttorneyGeneral or the Prime Minister.

* with the approval of the Minister, given with the concurrence of the Treasurer, borrow money from an approved bank or from another lender for the purposes of working capital of the Commission and give **security** over any of its assets for the purposes of any such borrowing.

* They might have said them to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  but I am not aware of anything of that sort being said.

* The Minister for Social **Security** asked us to believe that he was motivated by good intentions in introducing this legislation and that he was doing so only in the interests of contributors.

* Indeed, as I understand it, some of these measures are the responsibility of the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham),  yet this legislation is to be administered by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The last remnant of the puritan ethic is the sense that everyone who goes to prison deserves to be there and that conditions ought to be tough, otherwise offenders will prefer the **security** and comfort of prison to the hazards of life outside.

* I ask the Minister for the Navy: Having regard to the fascinating events now taking place in London involving the accredited representatives of a for eign power and what is termed 'industrial espionage', does the Minister assure the House of the **security** of naval establishments, dockyards and construction centres to design and build Australia's new destroyers for our future defence at sea?

* Nor will we get any satisfaction from the sorts of answers which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  gave in another place today.

* If it is not, why are people in the Department of Social **Security** imposing work bans?

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who is sitting in the House at the moment has drawn my attention to an instance where there has even been a lack of sewerage in a recently provided housing estate and insufficient attention has been given to the need to relate it properly to employment opportunities, pre-school and educational facilities, shopping- 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
What is the cost of replacing the means test with the income test on each of the pensions and benefits paid by the Department of Social **Security**.

* It is time that honourable members in this Parliament look at the question of the recognition of .the People's Republic of China to bring it into its rightful place in the United Nations - to bring it into the **Security** Council.

* Admission of Taiwan, as sought by the US and Australian Governments, would require **Security** Council approval and a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly which in his opinion could not be mustered.

* They know, in fact, that the People's Republic will be recognised as the rightful Government of China and will take its place in the **Security** Council.

* The first responsibility of government is to provide a nation with **security** from armed attack and from the constraints of independent national decisions imposed by the threat of such attacks.

* Appropriations for defence represented 8.8 per cent of Government outlays, education represented 8.9 per cent, health represented 10.6 percent and social **security** and welfare- wait for it- 27.2 per cent.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The tragedy of the situation is- and this is well known to lawyers- that it has become a lottery of chance as to whether a person gets compensation.

* Of course the Government picks up the tab through the Department of Social **Security**.

* I wonder whether any work will be done in relation to the number of people who having been compensated under these outmoded and cumbersome schemes that operate in the States have expended their money and are now a burden on the Social **Security** payroll.

* Because these people who suffered permanent disabilities were unable to live on the money which was awarded to them they are now on the Social **Security** payroll.

* Before things quieted down **security** forces were called out, 1 1 people were killed and more than 100 were injured.

* The news of recent tightening up of **security** in Indonesia is also disturbing.

* They are not being achieved, and unless there is a fundamental change in government thinking about its role in relation to stimulating and guiding the economy there will not be the sort of economic growth that we will need now and in the future to sustain the sort of change that is already upon us and to guarantee **security** of employment for people already in the work force.

* We are seeing a rapid acceleration of the redundancy trend, moving out from the blue collar sector into the white collar sector, challenging the **security** of employment of the middle class now as much as in the past it has challenged the **security** of the blue collar class, especially the unskilled and semi-skilled.

* Broadly, the aim was to ensure economic **security** for wheat growers and a No to stabilise export earnings.

* These aircraft had sufficient range to fly direct to Maralinga from Singapore, thus evading any **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
In dealing with applications from persons seeking to enter Australia and who are the holders of Rhodesian passports or who are persons ordinarily resident in Rhodesia but who travel on other passports, the policy of the Australian Government has been to take a stand which is in every way consonant wilh the resolutions of the **Security** Council of the United Nations.

* I hope that from what 1 have said the honourable gentleman will see that these cases are different in type and that the decisions which were made were fully in accord with Australia's obligations under the resolutions of the **Security** Council of the United Nations.

* and (2) The information sought by the honourable member is not available to the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Department of Social **Security**'s responsibility for capital assistance for accommodation of aged people does not extend to all of the areas implied in parts 1 and 2 of this question.

* The amount of money that will be available to local government authorities, I believe, will be of significant assistance to them and I also believe it will give them a **security** in revenue, not just for this year but for future years.

* There was no certainty, no **security** under the arrangements that had been made that grants would continue to flow year by year.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  also left Australia on 1 June to attend the International Conference of Women Leaders in Israel and to take up activities associated with the International Year of the Child in the course of visits to Europe and the United States.

* The Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  is acting as Minister for Social **Security** until  Senator Guilfoyle  's return on 24 June.

* I am therefore pleased that the Governor-General's Speech indicated that the Government would be reviewing the concept of the income **security** system as a whole, including the effectiveness of guaranteed minimum income proposals in overcoming poverty.

* I sincerely hope that the spirit of the Henderson Commission's recommendation on income **security**, which provides that money will be distributed where it is most needed, will be implemented.

* I can assure them that I will tackle their problems assiduously as their problems, whether they be problems of immigration, social **security** or education, are all national problems.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 11 May 1978: 
This is the point at which international pressure must be applied and Australia's influence should be exerted in the same direction.

* This, I believe, was the point of the United States veto in the **Security** Council this week, and it was right.

* -I suppose it would be fair to summarise the proposition of the honourable member for McPherson  (Mr Eric Robinson)  in this way: Instead of putting money into social **security** we should put it into the companies and big businesses that he supports and that he runs and that the Opposition Parties have always supported.

* 1 108 on notice on this matter to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  but I have taken out some figures from the last annual report Under the Aged Persons Homes Act religious institutions have received $93.5m subsidy in capital expenditure and about $10m this year.

* The great understanding and closer ties between the 2 countries on a wide range of fronts which the treaty makes possible will not only be of great mutual benefit; it will also benefit the countries of the west Pacific and strengthen forces for peace and **security** in the Asia-Pacific region.

* A lot of work has to be done to clean up the polluted urban environment, to provide basic cultural and community services in the outer suburbs, to improve and extend public transport services and to ensure **security** of housing for our people.

* The allegation was that Bhutto had arranged to assassinate Ahmed Raza Kasuri, an Opposition member of Parliament, culminating in a machine gun attack on his car in Lahore on the night of 10 November 1 974 by two members of the Federal **Security** Force, a trigger-happy para-military group.

* The prosecution seems to have thrown out a very wide net, as is generally the case in conspiracy charges, with the result that two of the seven originally accused, both members of the Federal **Security** Force, turned State's evidence in order to incriminate the others.

* Bhutto was in a powerful position to exert influence over the Federal **Security** Force.

* The attempt on Ahmed Raza Kasuri was by members of the Federal **Security** Force.

* He has used the members of the Federal **Security** Force for personal vendetta and for satisfaction of an urge in him to avenge himself upon a person whom he considered his enemy.

* I have little time available to me, so I will concentrate on social **security**.

* In such fields as health, social **security** and help for Aborigines and in other areas such as education, the Labor Government has tried in a way that the Liberals did not to introduce genuine social reform.

* I should like to put forward a proposal to him that perhaps the government could advance moneys to the permanent building societies on the **security** of their insured mortgages.

* The Government could secure its investment with the permanent building societies by using the mortgages as a straight-out **security** or alternatively have the interest on assigned mortgages paid directly to them and merely pay a fee to the building societies for the collection of the money and administration costs on the repayment of the existing mortgages.

* We in this country are being lulled into a false sense of **security**, as were the Romans and Athenians.

* He said something about the country being lulled into a false sense of **security**.

* Migrants will not forget the door knocks which followed the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation fiasco last year when the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  raided ASIO headquarters.

* I have written to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  about this matter asking whether he will be able to do something to make money available at a much lower rate of interest than 10 or 11 per cent.

* I earlier quoted the Minister for Social **Security**, the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  as saying in this Parliament only last week that seven out of every ten of the 5.7 million people in the Australian work force are not yet covered by superannuation.

* Did the Attorney-General in a speech on 11th September 1971 state that admission of Dick Gregory to Australia's free society would risk **security** or be contrary to the public interest more than the admission of racially restricted sporting teams whose admission has been proscribed by forums of world public opinion and world **security** organisations as inimical to **security** and to the public interest.

* In this nation at the present time we have a false sense of **security**, believing that we are doing all we can to make penalties severe.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: 
1 ) How many opinion polls or surveys have been commissioned or carried out by the Department of Social **Security** in each year from 1975 to date and how many have not been completed.

* We must ensure that we have proper defence installations and proper military associations and connections with our allies to ensure the **security** of Australia.

* Members opposite must somehow persuade Australians that they are the true custodians of our defence and **security**.

* Since that date every move to build up regional **security** has been assailed by the Australian Labor Party.

* I expect that no one knows that better than the honourable member for Mackellar because I have had access to the research papers of very high quality which have been compiled by officers of the Department of Social **Security**.

* But we do not intend to allow the people who depend on social **security** benefits to suffer the discrimination and the denial which was the hallmark of LiberalCountry Party administration of this important area of public responsibility.

* Bluntly expressed, those industries propped up in this way are in receipt of a social **security** payment.

* It is not the Government of the Australian people who have a long tradition of commendable personal values of fair play, of giving a man a go, of look ing after the battler whether the battler is the young married couple trying to build a home for the future, the wage and salary earner struggling to raise and educate a family, or the pensioner trying to establish **security** and human dignity - his right - in retirement.

* -The original Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in 1 974 for a three-year period by the then Minister for Social **Security**, the present Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Hayden.

* When the legislation was introduced in 1974 the then Minister for Social **Security**, Bill Hayden, pointed out the contrast between the millions of dollars which are spent in this country enforcing laws such as those relating to vagrancy which harass the homeless persons who are assisted under this legislation, and the pittance spent in providing shelter, rest, nutrition, rehabilitation and counselling for the heterogeneous group of people whom we conveniently label homeless, although it is purely a label of convenience.

* That revenue goes back into health, social **security** and other services which otherwise would have to be financed by increased taxation.

* All members of this Parliament will be fully aware of my longstanding concern for the welfare of the people of East Timor, not merely because of Australia's debt of gratitude to them for their stalwart and loyal support in the dark days of World War II, but because I believe, and all Australians believe, in the sanctity of basic human rights, including self-determination and, of course, all of us would be concerned about the threat to Australia's integrity and national **security** posed by the continuation of major military action involving all forms of conventional warfare in an area that is less than half an hour flying time from Darwin.

* And as should have been well known, Tun Razak, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who so recently duchessed the Prime Minister in Kuala Lumpur, and not so long ago duchessed me as well, the author of the idea of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, has stated over and over again that his proposals are for the distant future and will require the guarantees of **security**, territorial integrity and independence by the super powers, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China.

* Labor has abandoned the principles of the Guam doctrine based on greater self sufficiency and regional **security**.

* The Minister for Defence was guilty of a miserable concoction of empty promises and irrelevant flights of imagination when in January 1974 he said in Washington: 
-My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* That direct subscription is covered by more than adequate **security** and funds deposited attract the commercial interest rates.

* These cover: Careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to re-export, enrichment, and reprocessing; and physical **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
We should encourage new approaches in the Indian Ocean.

* As far as the Indian Ocean is concerned, the American bases in Australia, especially that at the North-West Cape, are a threat to our continued peace and to the **security** of the region.

* At the same time consumers, in a situation of rapidly rising money incomes and prices, growing industrial unrest and reduced job **security**, reacted more cautiously than expected, lt was the combination of these influences which produced a change in the labour market situation.

* None of them has ever asked me if there is any disagreement between me and the Minister for Social **Security**, but this has been given publicity.

* I say that there is no difference of view between me and the Minister for Social **Security**.

* It is exactly the same sort of gimmick as the social **security** and veterans ' affairs indexation gimmick.

* The term 'disadvantaged person' certainly includes people, for example, who are on unemployment benefits or sickness benefits or on many other social **security** benefits without having the benefit of the pensioner health card.

* I refer now to social **security**.

* Even if it were to cost us on this side of the Parliament office in government - I speak purely for myself - I believe that it would be worth while to lose office if we could see emerge a strongly anti-Communist Labor Party prepared to have a bi-partisan approach once more on the vital issues which affect Australia's **security**.

* For me personally, 1 believe that it would be worth while for us even to lose office if in doing so we were sure that there would emerge a strongly anti-Communist Labor Party prepared to have a bi-partisan approach once more on the vital issues that affect Australia's **security**.

* It pays no regard to the interests of Australia's **security** or the freedom of small' countries under bitter attack in Indo-China.

* In the  19  years to  1969  we rejected  529  applicants for naturalisation on **security** grounds and  20,022  on other grounds.

* People cannot get proper **security** for their investments because of this.

* I talked to the  Clerk  of the House about this matter and I am convinced that a resolution of this House would be sufficient to demand that anything to be required of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation would have to be provided to this House.

* I was just suggesting that the Minister might like to look carefully at this amendment, and, when he comes to the report stage, having discussed the matter with those concerned in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  say to himself: 'Which is to prevail, the sovereignty of Parliament or the Executive?'

* If the Act is interpreted in strict legal terms, the Department of Social **Security** is absolved from taking certain actions or making certain investigations in some cases.

* On 25 May 1977 I placed on notice a series of questions to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  relating to the guidelines set down to enable persons to be warrantors for persons receiving pensions from the Department of Social **Security**.

* The answer to that question was: 
I know that this is a very sensitive area and I know that it is in an area in respect of which the Department of Social **Security** has received a lot of bad publicity lately.

* There are many people within the Department of Social **Security** who do an excellent and very fine job, but I believe that there are times when officers of the Department need to cast their thoughts a little further than the strict reading of the law.

* I believe that in many cases the Department of Social **Security** is far too protective for its own good.

* When the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was assented to in 1974 this organisation made an application to the Department of Social **Security** for the establishment of new premises in Brisbane.

* I would also like to raise one other matter about the Department of Social **Security** which I hope the Minister will note.

* I also believe it would be a very effective means for the Department of Social **Security** to employ in order to communicate with many of the outlying areas and the new suburban developments which so often are the source of so many of the social problems in our community today.

* To my mind one of the most important roles of the Department of Social **Security** is to communicate with the general public the wide range of services and benefits which are available.

* It certainly is a vital aspect of the work of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I wish to commend the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for his initiative in this piece of legislation the Homeless Persons Assistance Bill.

* According to the annual report of the Department of Social **Security** for 1973-74, there are presently 54,420 nursing home beds in this country and of this number 42,328 are in what are called participating homes, meaning religious or charitable or private nursing homes as distinct from State nursing homes.

* As a result, during last year, through representations made directly to the Board and through me to the Board, the Board made recommendations for a lift of 900 in the staff ceilings in the Department of Social **Security**.

* A total of 900 additional staff was recommended for the Department of Social **Security**, an increase of 8 percent, at a time when staff numbers in the Service as a whole were reduced by 2 per cent.

* I refer to the raid on the Melbourne offices of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I want to know whether the Prime Minister has had the opportunity to refresh his memory as to whether any expression of concern was made by the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation as to the events on 16th March involving the AttorneyGeneral.

* The role of the  40  per cent to  60  per cent of the  284,000  will be to ensure the **security** of the base areas and also they will be used in  a  positive role to prevent a build-up against the **security** ot the United States and other free forces there.

* -Early last year quite a number of questions were asked about **security** clearances of ministerial staff.

* There has never been an allegation in the Parliament or in any of the media, so far as I have ever seen, that there has been any breach of **security** by any member of the staff of any of my Ministers.

* As the existing Department of Social **Security** internal manuals were drawn up by the previous Government I felt it .

* However, very soon after assuming my portfolio I requested the Social **Security** Advisory Council to, in consultation with the Department of Social **Security**, redraft these manuals in line with the more sensitive social values of the present Government.

* They will be made available for scrutiny at all offices of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Using earlier reports from the Department of Social **Security**, I think it was, it is shown that the average number of medical services for a person covered under the old system of private health insurance was 5.1 in 1975.

* The national goals I had in mind are our own national **security**; an independent Papua New Guinea, well disposed to Australia; closer relations with our nearest and largest neighbour, Indonesia; and the peace and prosperity of our neighbourhood.

* Haslem) says that no unemployment benefits should be paid at all; the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  harasses the unemployed; the Treasurer floats the prospect of no holiday bonus being paid; and some of the Liberal Party back bench members are urging more cuts in social **security** expenditure.

* The regressive measures that this Government has introduced since it came to office include the personal income tax restructuring in 1978, a tax on social **security** benefits, the abolition of estate and gift duty, the excise duty increases in 1978-79, the customs duty increases in 1978-79, non-indexation of family allowances, the abolition of the property component in the means test, less frequent indexation of pensions, the freezing of unemployment benefits, the moves to payment in arrears, harassment of recipients, freezing of rates for juniors, non-indexation for those without dependants, the abolition of the maternity allowance, the cut in the Aboriginal programs, the complete destruction of Medibank, the composition of education funds, cuts in urban public transport funds, the reduction in the coal levy, oil pricing at import parity, the investment allowance, and the increase in the retention allowance.

* After all, in one city in America, by using a computer in its social welfare agency it was found that a woman who had been receiving social **security** payments for 15 years had never had a medical examination.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 28 August 1979: 
What percentage of those Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders eligible for (a) age pensions, (b) invalid pensions, (c) widows' pensions, (d) other pensions, (e) social **security** sickness benefits or (f) unemployment benefits, is estimated not to be receiving these payments on account of limited motivation, awareness or capacity to obtain the payments.

* Notwithstanding the High Court's decision and the determination made by the Director-General of Social **Security** in his own right, the Opposition has failed to make a credible case.

* Under section 124 of the Social Services Act the Director-General of Social **Security** has a discretion to make a special benefit payment where because of age, physical or mental disability, or domestic circumstances, or for any other reason a person is unable to earn sufficient livelihood for himself or his dependants, if any.

* Both of these measures will assist in the future development and **security** of the coal mining industry.

* How true this statement is today, because the greatest danger to the **security** of our country, both internally and externally, is the apathy of many Australians.

* In the past people have been seriously prejudiced by adverse **security** assessments.

* Two such audits have been held, one by  Mr Acting  Justice White in South Australia and the other into the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation by  Mr Justice  Hope.

* I refer to statements like: 'We must sustain a defence force which supports our diplomacy so that both in combination effectively deter interference with Australian sovereignty'that is a reasonable proposition- and 'We need a defence force with capabilities affording the Government of the day the option of giving defence help to regional friends with whom we have common **security** interests'.

* Other countries can discuss their defence matters publicly and in great depth without any serious threat to their **security**; without any serious threat to their actual defence force.

* -In dealing with the estimates for the Department of Social **Security** I would like to spend some time discussing the problems of lone fathers in Australia.

* 3, in introducing the outlays for the Department of Social **Security**, states: 
The Australian Social **Security** System is intended to protect people from economic hardship caused by events such as loss of earnings through age, invalidity, sickness, unemployment or the loss or absence of a supporting male as a result of death, desertion or long-term separation.

* But this does not offer the **security** of a pension, nor does it offer the opportunity for lone fathers to work limited hours and receive a part pension, as lone mothers are able to do.

* Recently in Perth I asked a social worker of the Department of Social **Security** to provide case study reports on 2 lone fathers who had visited me.

* I know that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator  Giulfoyle) is  aware  of  this problem and is very concerned about these families.

* In conclusion, I would like to depart from the normal practice of many members in this chamber and pay tribute to some of the public servants in the Department of Social **Security** in Perth.

* Many of my representations go to the Minister for Social **Security** or the office of her Department located in Perth.

* If a position of reasonable level is not available in the proposed new structure, what **security** or alternative employment will be offered to  personnel  of long service who are still classed as temporary public  servants,  although they have rendered many years of service and effort to their organisation.

* It was in the course of the Grievance Day debate in this House on 28 April 1977 that I brought to the notice of the House the dangers to our **security** threatened by, and the rape of the Great Barrier Reef perpetrated by Tawainese fishermen in their illegal poaching of the Reef.

* The recent arrest of these vessels on Swains Reef off the Central Queensland coast highlights not only this gap in our **security** but many other matters.

* The area is surrounded by a **security** fence and is under surveillance by Commission staff and by Commonwealth Police.

* Can he also inform the House with respect to reports of increased road building activity by the Chinese and the North Vietnamese in Laos and indicate whether those activities are regarded by non-Communist countries in Indo-China as constituting a direct threat to their **security** and further evidence of Comunist aggressive intent and practice?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
On the publication of this initial report the Department of Social **Security** as much as it was able to do in Perth, carried out a check of the addresses to which cheques were being posted and could find no evidence that social service cheques were being posted to a wine saloon.

* This week social **security** cheques will be posted and a comprehensive check will be made, but we feel fairly confident, on the basis of the first check, that there is no evidence to support this allegation at all.

* The program outlined by the Governor-General demonstrates that this young Government will not allow responsibility vacuums to develop and be filled by extra-parliamentary groups in matters of social **security**, health, industrial relations and equality of opportunity.

* But now, under this Government's program, this fast growing sector of Melbourne may soon experience the **security** of adequate health care.

* years with some assurance of predictability and **security**.

* We have seen further examples of difficulties arising between the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* It pointed out that many unemployed people have been passed by the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Labor and Immigration to charity agencies.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Not long after our task force arrived in Vietnam one company was engaged by four battalions of Vietcong and North Vietnamese in the Long Tan plantations.

* As well as guaranteeing the **security** of Phuoc Tuy Province and breaking the hold of the Vietcong tax gatherers our forces concentrated on civic action in a number of fields.

* It is one where physical **security** has been vastly improved.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation wanted photographs of these sinister people who were protesting against the meagre increase in pensions.

* They will provide background material and assist inquiries to the maximum extent consistent with the day to day demands on their resources and **security** requirements.

* We are confident that, where the Committee is considering matters of national **security**, it will accept the ordinary rules which apply to discussion of such matters in order to prevent needless public exposure of differences between Australia and other countries and irresponsible speculation about sensitive areas of Australia's international relations.

* The next matter to which I refer is in the estimates for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation found in Supply Bill (No.

* If that is all the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has to do in this nation and if that is why we provided $7.8m this financial year, then it is about time that ASIO members went back to school.

* If we are going to indulge in schoolboy exercises like this, it seems to me that priorities in matters of grave national **security** in this nation are very low.

* Inflation, without doubt, next to this Government, is the greatest destroyer of **security** in Australia.

* I suggest to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  that although I agree completely with the view that matters of this nature are better determined at a State government level by virtue of its proximity to the scene, I would very much like to see the Commonwealth having some say, or exercising a larger interest than may have happened in the past in determining whether these projects are needed.

* I ask the Minister to take back to the Minister for Social **Security**, and perhaps even to Cabinet, the suggestion that, since the Commonwealth is paying out $2 for every $ 1 put up by the State Government, this is a matter in relation to which the Commonwealth should say:  We recognise your greater ability to exercise discretion because of your closeness to the scene but we like to ensure that, in cases where need is real and great, because of our contribution, projects concerned with areas of need will be given some priority over projects in areas which may not have such a demand or need '.

* I noted how the **security** branch's action in that country have caused some people to be charged and others to be detained for long periods of time and how still others have fled from South Africa.

* He saw that Wollongong 's prosperity and **security** lay in coal, and he spent his life promoting and selling the world's oldest, most plentiful and most enduring energy resource.

* As a result of his work no government, Federal or State, and no corporation, Australian or foreign, now or in the future will ever again downgrade or disregard the future **security** and importance of our natural resources or Australia's stake in their development.

* These 2 provisions are aimed at giving us a greater opportunity to seize upon available markets and to assure those who in the commercial world have the responsibility of undertaking arrangements in the export field of a degree of **security** in the event of some unforeseen occurrence that could jeopardise a sizeable export arrangement.

* Certainly, we can go further if there is **security** for the exporter of the kind provided in this measure.

* If a diversion is detected or if a country cannot give a satisfactory explanation for a discrepancy which is picked up in an IAEA inspection the matter would be reported to the Board of Governors and all the members of the IAEA, the **Security** Council and the General Assembly.

* Finally, countries which have invested heavily in nuclear power reactors and which are coming to rely on that power generating capacity will obviously attach the greatest importance to the **security** of supplies of fuel.

* Before that occurred the Minister for Social **Security** at the time, who was also, I think, Acting Treasurer pan of the time, described that car as a lemon and did what he could to hasten its unhappy end.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** of the time said it.

* Our workers want jobs, long service leave, reasonable wages and **security** and the right to full employment and be employed in their own environment, but if they want those things, we must be prepared to pay for them.

* By the nature of the processes, there must be some delay in assessing and approving applications for various forms of social **security** benefits, as they are known now.

* Our general approach to social **security** payments is to try to clean up the extensive anomalies, inconsistencies and injustices which riddle the system.

* I think that there was every justification for such remarks because it was a Labor government which, after many years of dissension and debate, gave the industry some kind of **security**.

* It belongs to the grower; it is there for his **security**.

* How many claimants for unemployment benefits were reported by the Commonwealth Employment Service to the Department of Social **Security** for refusing an offer of suitable employment between 1 January 1973 and 3 March 1973.

* What effect did such reports have on the determination by the Department of Social **Security** of the eligibility of such claimants for benefit.

* What we should be discussing at this time is not whether governments should be providing services such as education, public transport and so on and still be providing income **security** but rather the nature of that commitment.

* The first principle is to provide **security** and wellbeing for all citizens and to acknowledge the importance of the independence and dignity of those people.

* But be the stay short or long in this Parliament all honourable gentlemen will find that the parliamentary institution does contribute something to the safety, **security** and stability of the country.

* In his absence, the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Bill  Hayden, will act as Treasurer.

* They went to the Department of Social **Security** to ascertain whether they could still receive their unemployment benefits if they started this organisation, on the understanding that they would still be eligible to be put into a job by the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* I made approaches to the Director-General of the Department of Social **Security** and eventually a meeting was arranged between the young people and  Mr Dowell,  the Director in New South Wales, who I must say treated the whole matter in a most sympathetic and realistic manner.

* If attempts to reach agreements with other countries have been unsuccessful - the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  included in his second reading speech a long list which indicates that this appears to be the case - then I think that this Bill is a necessary and logical development of the Bill which became law 12 months ago.

* As I said earlier, I hope that the Department of Social **Security** will be able to maintain a check to ensure that, although inevitably there will be some abuse, it does not become too widespread.

* When one came to the end, with bitter disappointment, one realised that the taxation and the social **security** legislation of the Commonwealth would be extended to Norfolk Island in full.

* As to that I just want to make it quite clear that the Government recognises the need for a social **security** system as a right and a need to provide proper services and proper benefits so that people can have a reasonable standard of living on the island.

* A guilt edged **security** returns 11 per cent or 12 per cent.

* I commend the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for enlarging something that was pioneered by the honourable member tor Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  when he was Minister for Social Services.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** to give heed to my suggestion - and to pass it on to his colleague, the Minister for Immigration - that special facilities should be created in these areas to inform the migrants about such matters as portability of pensions.

* Honourable members on this side of the House get sick and tired of hearing honourable members opposite suggesting - we heard it again from the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  - that nobody on this side of the House has any regard for the defence or the **security** of this nation.

* If this is the way honourable members opposite approach questions relating to our defence how can they claim to be members of the only Party in the Commonwealth to whom the **security** of this nation can be entrusted?

* 1 fear a lot of the people  who  are responsible for the conduct of the industry could be lulled into a false sense of **security** by thinking that the industry is quite all right because the turnover is so great.

* A healthy and expanding tourist industry will mean **security** of employment for the people engaged in providing those services.

* We know that in many of those situations Aboriginals are receiving social **security** benefits.

* He forgets the social **security** benefits that are involved.

* The letter continued: ... a government could try to avert this threat by instituting a tough policy of **security**, for example, infiltration of politically active community opposition groups, inspection of mail, and mass media censorship.

* They are the steps to which one may be forced to go in order to ensure **security**, but in the process of ensuring **security** what sort of society do we finish up with?

* The letter went on: 
So much for **security** in the sense that it is really terribly complicated for one to make a bomb.

* I turn to **security** and the international safeguards.

* This has been a totally cosmetic exercise to date, and in fact all sections that deliver post-settlement services to migrants in Australia remain in the Department of Social **Security**.

* Within the Minister's specific concern is the telephone interpreter service for which the Department of Social **Security** is now appropriating an extra $140,000 over and above the $260,000 that was appropriated last year.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
1 ) What staff canteens are operated by the Depanment of Social **Security**.

* What decision has been made by the Depanment of Social **Security** concerning subsidisation of each canteen and what was the estimated cost of such subsidisation to each canteen for 1976-77.

* Are there any arrangements made by the Depanment of Social **Security** for any staff canteen to be operated by private enterprise; if so, which canteens and under what terms and conditions.

* It provides for the Minister for Social **Security** to draw up a common form of undertaking.

* To ensure that persons in such areas are not deprived of the benefits under the proposed new arrangements, because of the requirement that fees be no higher than the negotiated schedule fees, the Bill, in clause 18, empowers the Minister for Social **Security** to make special arrangements for the provision of optometrical services, by participating optometrists, to persons in isolated areas.

* We have satisfied ourselves that a volunteer force will not jeopardise national **security**, and we believe it will have a beneficial effect on the military as well as the rest of our society.

* Reserve Bank- Construction and use of theoretical economic models, development of note printing machines and **security** techniques.

* 1 should think that there can be no question that the matters going on today both in another place and in this place in relation to the Australian **Security** ' Intelligence Organisation and the activities of certain Croatians are important matters.

* Therefore, we do have obligations to ensure that the income **security** measures at Norfolk Island are at least as good as they are in other parts of Australia.

* How many persons were in the employment of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation as at 30 June in each of the years I960, 1965, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973.

* However, with the cease fire in Beirut we have been able to get a task force into Beirut to make an assessment on the ground both as to the **security** for any proposed reopening of the Beirut embassy and on less important matters such as the condition of our buildings.

* As always, the main debates were concerned with problems of the Commonwealth of Nations and world **security**.

* 1 have already referred to some of the developments that have taken place over these 3 years but in this period we have only gone part of the way towards making this Association a really effective force in world peace and **security**.

* Good luck is no **security**.

* But notwithstanding the increased degree of training of a professional soldier today and in the future it is one of the facts of life that if Australia is faced at some time in the future with a threat to its **security** we will need to use the services of the part-time soldier, the voluntary soldier, the man who serves in the CMF.

* Surely it is basic to our **security** in this part of the world that we should develop good relations with our neighbours and indicate that we are interested in training their armed forces.

* Quite a substantial change is proposed in some aspects of social services, or social **security** as it is known nowadays.

* But the point is that if any motion of this character came up in the **Security** Council- presumably where it is suggested- there are 5 members there who could exercise the veto.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Is he a socialist?

* I think that the Canberra Branch must be a **security** risk for thinking so differently from the honourable member for Stirling.

* The technological needs of Evans Deakin were never brought up to date because the management had no **security** and no backing from the previous Government to ensure that it would have a secure and viable industry.

* He is responsible for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I just want to say a word or two about that distinguished organisation, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* It has been engaged in **security** buying and selling and has been concerned with the loan market, inscribed stock and so on.

* May I ask the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  when his second reading speech on this Bill was prepared and typed?

* I, as the Opposition spokesman on health and social **security**, have been challenged to deliver the health policy of the Opposition.

* A spokesman for the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  criticised  Dr Deeble  today for having exceeded his brief.

* The spokesman said that  Dr Deeble,  a special adviser to the Department of Social **Security**, had no authority to commit the Minister - as he had done in the document .

* This is demonstrated in part by the fact that the jungle warfare training centre has been established by a special cadre sent to Vietnam for this purpose while the 2 battalions continue with their **security** tasks.

* As a result, it has been progressively possible over the last 2 to  3  months to hand over additional areas where the prime responsibility - not the sole responsibility - for **security** rests with regional forces.

* This Bill comes within the administrative responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* However, because the BUI complements the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Bill 1976 which I have just introduced the Minister for Social **Security** has asked me to present this Bill to the House.

* When one looks at the anatomy of the Budget one finds that over two-thirds of total Federal expenditure is accounted for by education, which takes 8.9 per cent; health, which takes 10.6 per cent; social **security** and welfare, which take 27.2 per cent, and payments to the 
The work of the Royal Australian Navy in oceanographic research is well known and the decision 2 years ago to design a specially built ocean science ship was proof that the Liberal-Country Party Government is concerned with the development of marine studies.

* Of course, the Royal Australian Navy has been concerned with defence matters but as so much of its research can be applied to civil marine science and technology I would hope that the Interim Council will be giving much thought to co-ordinating the efforts of the Royal Australian Navy and that the Royal Australian Navy in turn will be as cooperative as **security** will permit.

* The honourable member for Macarthur asked a few questions about social **security** and matters of that nature.

* There is no **security** in no inflation.

* The second person indicated that he had a very clear recollection of the incident and at the time believed that I had over-reacted in being so firm in my objections to a representative of IBM Australia Ltd being associated, in Canada, with officers of the Department of Social **Security**, and thought that I was being excessively harsh in indicating that that sort of thing should cease and should not happen again.

* I observe next the impropriety of the Government having public servants in the Department of Health and the Department of Social **Security** working until the early hours of the morning one day last week checking on the files of the Labor Government to see what they could dredge up.

* I am glad to say that in my community the community outrage about this decision has been such that the Department of Social **Security** has backed away from the decision it has made.

* At least a reliable water supply will give these people the **security** that such a supply can offer.

* The Commonwealth must continue to make grants for projects of this nature that guarantee the future comfort and **security** of all our people whether they live in rural or urban areas.

* Also because the deaf are employable they do not receive any special benefits or concessions from the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister has informed me that the Australian Telecommunications Commission intends approaching the various social welfare departments- the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of Health and the Department of Veterans' Affairs- to investigate whether or not they will be prepared to assist possible users financially by subsidising purchases or rentals of these devices.

* My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** and Minister for Repatriation and Compensation.

* Port Augusta, South Australia: Establishment of Office of the Department of Social **Security**  (Question No.

This Government has an unhappy record in regard to civil rights and such matters when it comes to the areas which it chooses to call 'public interest' or 'national **security**'.

* Whilst I am unhappy about some of the activities that Australians get up to overseas, again, I am not sure that we would not be trespassing upon the general feeling of what civil law ought to be, what public and criminal law ought to be and what national **security** really requires, if we assumed that the punishment that an Australian received somewhere else in the world for an action which probably would be offensive to the law in the country in which he was operating, was not enough.

* The proposition that is put forward is, I think, well known, and that is that since Minsec did not of itself own assets - all those assets being pledged, the assets being shares in various other companies - it was therefore suggested that a consortium should advance a loan to the liquidator appointed to Minsec, the liquidator being able to use that loan to free Minsec's assets which were held as **security** by other persons, the liquidator then being able to dispose of those shares in the interests of those for whom he was appointed as liquidator.

* This would be a fatal miscalculation and a condition of complacency that could well sell out the **security** of this nation.

* One of the subjects of discussion will be China's admission to the **Security** 
Council because one must keep in mind that if Communist China does take a prominent seat in the **Security** Council, perhaps to the temporary exclusion of Taiwan, forever and a day China could veto the readmittance of Taiwan.

* On one issue China has ample support and that is that it should be admitted to the General Assembly, but the main obstacle at present is the seating of Taiwan and the further issue of which country shall sit in the **Security** Council.

* There has recently been a big swing in favour of Communist China but there is still strong support for maintaining Taiwan's seat in the General Assembly, although it does seem certain that, if Communist China gets into the United Nations, it will be awarded a seat in the **Security** Council also.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The House is debating today a very serious matter, a matter which is central to the forthcoming election - that is, that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Government have misled the House and the people of Australia over the Government's health proposals which are supposedly to be one of the major features of the Government's election program.

* Prior to the suspension of the sitting, we were debating the actions of the Minister for Social **Security** in attempting to cover up secret negotiations aimed at amending the Government's proposed health scheme.

* We have a situation where, at the same time as the Minister was presenting a supposedly genuine reintroduction of the discredited Health Insurance Bill which was defeated last year - we were told that the Bill was reprinted on 19 March - on 20 March, at the Minister's urging, a letter was sent from an official of the Department of Social **Security** to the National Standing Committee on Private Hospitals asking for a meeting for the purpose of making considerable alterations to this scheme.

* He had the misfortune to be followed by the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  one of the men who in this chamber commands the greatest respect for his dedication to the development of serious policies in relation to social **security**.

* I just want to say to both the honourable member for Macarthur and the honourable member for St George that if they look at the real amounts expended in 1975-76 they will see that in that financial year the expenditure was so much greater than the foolish projections of their Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  when she takes averages back to 1954 and then erects figures on 25 per cent of that average.

* I took the opportunity recently to raise this matter during question time when I asked the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to clarify the situation in regard to Press publicity that was being given at that time to the closure of the Lynfield private nursing home at Wynnum in my electorate.

* I want now to refer again to the question I asked of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* In July the Minister for Social **Security** offered the Queensland Minister for Health a government grant amounting to $1.2m on a $1 for $1 basis.

* It was disclosed by the Minister for Social **Security** a couple of months ago 'that some 400 patients in homes are in need of alternative accommodation and will have to find it within the next 12 to 18 months due to the failure of the State Government to provide alternative accommodation.

* Will the Minister for Social Services inform the Senate whether the Government intends that the Social **Security** Committee, the Government members of which were elected last November, shall continue to function, in view of the vast expansion of social services envisaged by the Government due to the success of the referendum of this issue?

* Following on a question I asked last Thursday, and the answer given by the Minister for Health and Social Services, I now ask the Minister whether in view of the fact that the Opposition is still on strike in connection with its representation on the Social **Security** Committee, will the Minister consider appointing a conciliation commissioner to arrange for the reconstitution of that committee, so that some of the many social problems awaiting solution may be investigated during the next parliamentary recess?

* Senator McKenna said:  1 acknowledge the great value of the work that has hitherto been done by all members of the Social **Security** Committee, and I am not aware that the present position is anything in the nature of a 'strike'; it may be merely a boycott.

* The greatest social **security** committee that was every set up by this Parliament was boycotted and disbanded because of the actions of the Liberal Party.

* I think it might be well worth while asking a committee consisting of, say, representatives of the Department of Health, the Department of Social **Security**, the various hospitals, the Australian Medical Association, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and other appropriate people to look into this matter.

* It said that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would establish a Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and that the migrant integration services being performed in the Department of Social **Security** would be transferred to the new Department.

* As the Department of Social **Security** admits in its own report, there is a long waiting list of voluntary agencies needing grants under the migrant social worker grantinaid scheme, and the Government has not responded to their pleas.

* As to the **security** situation about which the honourable member asks, efforts are now being made to implement an agreement of 25 July 1977 regulating the presence of Palestinians in 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member 's question.

* 1 ) In response to an Australian invitation the following countries indicated their interest in the possibility of entering into negotiations for reciprocal agreements on social **security**: 
During the year the United States Government established a statutory authority, the Government National Mortgage Association.

* GNMA  will enable lenders for housing to raise new funds by the issue of guaranteed debentures, the guaranteed debentures to be issued on the **security** of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration .

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
How many persons are employed by the Department of Social **Security** or by agencies responsible to the Minister or her Department in a staff recruiting capacity and what amounts are chargeable to that Department or such agencies in respect of their annual salaries.

* To what extent does the Department of Social **Security** or any such agency engage private employment agencies to assist in the recruitment of staff.

* What sum was spent by the Department of Social **Security** or any such agency in engaging private employment agencies in the financial year 1974-75.

* To what extent does the Department of Social **Security** or any such agency engage or otherwise obtain assistance for the Commonwealth Employment Service in the recruitment of staff and what sum has been paid to the Commonwealth Employment Service in respect of such assistance.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has pointed out in the House, a court case is pending- I understand that it is listed for 14 February, later this week- in which the validity and the power of the HCF and the MBF in New South Wales to charge and collect not only higher contributions but also arrears following increases in contributions which are backdated will be challenged.

* Has his attention been drawn to Staff Instruction 693 of 14lh July 1972 emanating from the Social **Security** Branch of the Brisbane Office of his Department and relating to payment of unemployment benefit to persons residing at the Salvation Army Home, 58 Glenrosa Road, Red Hill.

* The heads of discussion at the conference were: The Commonwealth and World **Security**; Parliament's Role in the Modern World; Social Problems of Today and Economic Problems.

* In regard to international affairs and the problems of **security**, members who attended the conference came to understand the anxiety of the Asian members to establish zones of peace in the Indian Ocean and South Bast Asia while at the same time members appreciated that these zones must be guaranteed and that until guarantees are forthcoming certain members - particularly the great trading nations - must be prepared to protect interests which are vital to their economies and their **security**.

* I had something to say on this matter when I moved the second reading of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill 1975 on 8 October 1975.I said: 
I interpolate that these are organisations such as the Department of Social **Security**.

* I went on: 
14) Is it a fact that parliamentarians' staff do not have the same **security** of tenure, promotional opportunities or provision of overtime and other allowances as steno-secretaries or other public servants.

* I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition is responding to charges made by somebody who, as I understand it, has himself been charged with serious **security** breaches in the United States.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Previous speakers from the Opposition side have made much play of the withdrawal of the subsidised health benefits plan.

* I believe that it is absolutely essential to consider the subsidised health benefits plan in the overall health and social **security** strategy of the present Government.

* We heard much chatter about what the Labor Government was doing in health and social **security** matters but one of the first acts of the new Minister was to get out the broom and sweep up the untidy house which the Australian Labor Party left.

* Because an investment bond is not a fixed interest **security** providing for repayment of a stated amount at a given time but a contractual interest in the value of a given collection of assets and in the income earned by them, it is possible to finance projects with little or no return in the early years but high growth and income at a later stage.

* If they, ignoring the present **security** circumstances, requirements and advice, have a situation in which any Federal Minister or I or a visitor from overseas, as has happened, were subject to a terrorist attack- and let them understand that the bomb that went off at the Hilton Hotel was let off - 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 28 May 1979: 
I now address myself to the third part of the Opposition amendment, which deals basically with the allocation of resources and the financial problems facing this Government.

* Let me mention increases in social **security** benefits or what the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  calls autumn pension increases.

* As all honourable members probably know the social **security** beneficiary- the widow, the would be breadwinner who is an invalid, the unemployed and the sick- who have dependants in their families are worst off.

* I am quite sure that if the Commission had accepted the Government's argument that the increase should be 3.2 per cent the Government would have granted only a 3.2 per cent increase to pensioners and other social **security** beneficiaries.

* I ask leave of the House to incorporate in  Hansard,  a table prepared by the Parliamentary Research Service setting out social **security** benefits between October 1972 and November 1975. 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 11 April 1978: 
I will give another example of why the legislation that the Minister put before the Parliament some weeks ago is certainly not working smoothly.

* They were to be the arbitrators, so to speak- the unpaid social **security** agents for the Minister.

* I understand also that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  stated in relation to these cases:  the Minister for Health and his Department would want to hear about them because the Government intends to take whatever action is necessary to overcome any difficulties that may result from the Government's proposals for disadvantaged persons.

* The Opposition is calling only for general Australian legislation to apply- this was probably the major point made by the Minister- in the areas of taxation, social **security**, and conciliation and arbitration.

* Some might say that a plan for Australian social **security**, taxation and industrial laws to apply on the island would mean the integration of Norfolk Island into Australia.

* The right of Norfolk Island to be free and yet for its people to have an entitlement to Australian social **security** benefits is a rather clouded issue.

* **Security** and the Department of Health.

* That Department should be able to act on his behalf, or he could be represented by the Department of Social **Security**.

* I think it is necessary to put the Australian Assistance Plan into some sort of perspective and to point out the extent of government outlays that are involved in social **security** and welfare as functional groupings in the Budget.

* It is interesting to note that in 1972-73 the Government allocated $2, 102m to social **security** and welfare and that in 1975-76 this amount had risen to an estimated $4,772m, which is an increase of over 100 per cent.

* This amount of course will be significantly higher because our allocations for social **security** and welfare are running at a rate of about 20 per cent of our total Budget.

* That is not necessarily a bad thing and I make no comment about it, but I think it is worth putting the overall social **security** system into that context.

* It is also interesting to note that the Budget Papers reveal that about $87m of the almost $5 billion allocated for social **security** and welfare is to go towards the cost of salaries and administration of the Department of Social **Security**.

* In that respect the administration of the social **security** system is not inordinately high.

* When compared with the amount that has been spent on social **security**, this is a minimal figure of $1 1.6m since the introduction of the Plan, admittedly on a pilot basis.

* A lot of areas need to be looked at in terms of social **security** and welfare in Australia.

* I do not want to deprive Australians of an adequate social **security** system.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  says that such projects are more amenable to administration and funding at State and local government levels.

* Even the Minister for Social **Security** acknowledges this.

* The use of expressions like 'proper' and 'appropriate' to describe Federal areas of responsibility are mere smokescreens thrown up by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Two examples that spring to mind are the grants to community agencies administered by the Migrant Community Services Branch of the Department of Social **Security** and the Community Arts Program of the Australia Council.

* Because of the differences in reporting in various newspapers throughout Australia I ask the Minister whether he used the phrase: 'Britain's **security** was no longer vital to Australia' when he was speaking at the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon at the Wesley Church in Melbourne yesterday.

* We have just heard the Minister for Social **Security** confusing himself and finally sitting down after 10 minutes of lengthy verbiage, having ignored the headlines that appeared this morning in the 'Age' newspaper - 'Inflation near crisis: experts'.

* An article by Tony Thomas stated: 
The Minister for Social **Security** was keen to quote  Dr Porter.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Gordon Freeth was very enthusiastic about accepting some sort of **security** pact with the Russians - the very people against whom the honourable member for Boothby was fatuously fulminating.

* The Taiwan Government, which at present occupies a seat in the **Security** Council at the expense of a country which has a population of 840 million, makes exactly the same pretentious demands upon all other governments.

* It is obvious that the recipients of social **security** payments have been hit hard by the Budget.

* Let me deal with social **security** benefits and some of the broken promises.

* The Government said that it would take politics out of social **security** benefit increases, which were to be granted twice a year in line with the consumer price index.

* In the social **security** area there are other matters which the Government has introduced in this Budget that affect the less fortunate in society.

* Although they get a small increase in superannuation, because they go over that level they lose any fringe benefits they have as well as some of their social **security** payments.

* The 2 matters mentioned- those concerning the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security**- have been attended to.

* I have given examples already of adjustments which have been made to the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security**.

* I believe that the formation of an independent Australia Council will inaugurate a new era of vitality and progress in the arts, that creative artists of all kinds will enjoy a new measure of **security** and status in the community, and that the Australian people as a whole will have new and wider opportunities to participate in the arts and enjoy the emotional, spiritual and intellectual rewards which the arts alone can provide.

* I refer to reports such as that on social policy and problems of the work force prepared under a social **security** research grant by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and reports to the Government from the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby.

* Apart from the specific migrant programs cut back to give more profits to private industry, general cuts m the broad social **security** program and in areas such as health will hit the migrant community savagely.

* The Minister for Defence  (Mr Fairbairn)  said very deliberately that there were members of the Press and members of this House who were trying to undermine the **security** of this nation.

* The honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  asked a question and the Minister for Defence, in his reply, implied that the honourable member for Lalor was undermining the **security** of this nation.

* It ought to give the people who are working in the scheme some frame within which to plan and some sense of **security**.

* It reflects on the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and on the Government.

* It is restricted to the solvency problem, the **security** problem of insurance companies.

* 1 ) What additional staff for (a) transit of passengers and baggage and (b) airport terminal **security** have been appointed at Australia's international airports since I February 1979.

* Already, from the point of view of the componentry industry, the Japanese have placed orders totalling $18m and this gives not only to the South Australian area but to all the component industries throughout Australia some guarantee and some **security** for their industry.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What sum was provided in the 1976-77 Budget estimates for (a) age pensions, (b) invalid pensions, (c) widows pensions, (d) unemployment benefits, (e) sickness benefits, (f) special benefits, (g) family allowances and (h) other social **security** benefits and allowances.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The conflict in Pakistan is a particularly tragic one; the Opposition has reservations about the Government's attitudes on this issue.

* After all, the United Nations **Security** Council, with the backing of Russia and the United States, managed to settle the war between India and Pakistan in 1965.

* However, I will take into consideration the support that the honourable gentleman has obviously shown for the program and some of the views that he has expressed and I will pass those on to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Bill relating to disclosure of credit rating records introduced into the Canadian House of Commons on 22 October 1976, (b) the United States Fair Credit Billing Act, (c) the United States Fair Credit Opportunity Act, (d) the United States Depository Institutions Amendment Act, (e) the United States Consumer Leasing Act, (f) the United States Equal Credit Opportunity Act, (g) the United States Consumer Credit Protection Act, (h) the Manitoba Consumer Protection Act and (i) the Manitoba Personal Property **Security** Act.

* She is a person who has obtained the highest **security** clearance that it is possible for anyone to obtain.

* She has been cleared by **security** to perform the kind of task to which I have appointed her.

* His only **security** in his enterprise is a so-called contract which is constantly renegotiated on either a general basis, with all growers supplying one processor, or a specific basis.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
and (2) The suggestion on page 276 of the Report 'Poverty in Australia' has been noted by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Labor Government did ease conditions somewhat in a more humane way, and the problem that always exercised my mind as Minister for Social **Security** was that while it is true that some people will abuse entitlements- a very small proportion of people, I might add- any really determined effective effort to clamp down on them by and large does not bring about a greatly improved result in detecting them and bringing them to book for their offences.

* Let me quote just some sections from the handbook for members of the Department of Social **Security** as at May 1974, about the work test.

* Paragraph 2/F/3 reads: 
I challenge the relevant Ministers- the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relationsto table in this Parliament the extracts from the handbook which guide officers of the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in terms of applying the work test, because it will then be discovered that the variations are quite moderate indeed and the only really new ones which I see from reading the Minister's speech provide for the postponement provisions of unemployment benefits, the prohibition of unemployment benefits for a school-leaver during a vacation period, and of course the requirement of the personal lodging of income statements every 2 weeks by an unemployment benefit recipient.

* My recollection is that the Labor Government required a statement every third week, and the reason we did that and the reason the Government is not introducing the old requirement of the lodgment of a statement personally every week is simply that the work load on the Department of Social **Security** in processing claims and in checking the legitimate eligibility of applicants is so great that the personal lodgment of claims overwhelmed the staff and prevented a full and efficient discharge of the obligations on them.

* The Department of Social **Security**, when I was Minister, and the Commonwealth Employment Service tracked down all these sorts of cases.

* Then, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr 
Believing that any improper activities in Australia by foreign intelligence services should be a cause of the deepest concern to any Australian Government, and endorsing in this context the statement made by  Mr Justice  Hope in his Third Report on Intelligence and **Security** that 'Australia's intelligence interests do not and cannot coincide with those of any other country'; 
It is utterly unsatisfactory for the Prime Minister to say that  Mr Justice  Hope has investigated the activities of the foreign intelligence services in Australia and that therefore no further inquiry is needed.

* We all know, as a result of  Mr Justice  Hope's inquiry, how necessary and how prudent it was to have an inquiry into our intelligence and **security** services.

* I support fully the call of my leader, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  of this country, for **security** for the poor, the handicapped and the unfortunate.

* We believe in good, honest and decent government and a policy of **security** for the Australian people so that they can plan their own programs.

* One phone call to the Department of Social **Security** would have shown that they were untrue.

* I remind honourable members that the shadow minister for social **security**, the honourable member for Hotham, a few weeks ago was talking about dismantling Medibank and was reprimanded by the Leader of the Opposition.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* In 1975, permanent building societies and savings banksthe main repositories of household savings- attracted a net increase in deposits of more than $3,000m, while the Commonwealth's Special Bonds- the **security** designed for small, non-professional investors- drew a net inflow of a mere $190m.

* Our sincerity will be measured by the way we treat returned servicemen from Vietnam after they have made their contribution to the safety and **security** of Australia.

* I urge that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  reconsider her decision.

* Today the Minister for Social **Security**, instead of acceding to the request for a grant of $28,000 which previously was paid through the Australian Assistance Plan, has given this project a once only grant of $5,000.

* Department of Social **Security**: Stalling: Delays in Providing Benefits (Question No.

* It is one of his attacks upon the Governmentthe fact that the administration of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and the issue of warrants for telephone tapping have been transferred from the AttorneyGeneral to the Prime Minister.

* The honourable gentleman knows because he has been informed right from the beginning that these changes are within the terms of reference of  Mr Justice  Hope, the royal commissioner looking into Australia's **security** services, and are recommendations which he has made; but, moreover, the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act itself says how warrants can be issued.

* The action can be initiated only by the Director-General, as he has hitherto been known, of **security**.

* No warrants to intercept telephone conversations can be issued in Australia without the initiative, without the recommendation, of the Director-General of **Security**.

* Henceforth, initiative for telephone tapping will be in the hands of the Director of **Security** who is a judge.

* He would, I believe, endorse and applaud the appointment of  Mr Justice  A. E. Woodward as the new Director of **Security**, and the Australian people ought to be reassured that there will be no telephone' tapping warrants issued in Australia unless  Mr Justice  Woodward makes that recommendation.

* I want to pay special tribute to the unselfishness of my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  for so generously allowing me the .

* We do question however, whether the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has given consideration to instructing that the recipients of household support be referred to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Department of Social **Security**, to alert such recipients to alternative opportunities available outside the rural sector.

* I second the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  which seeks the appointment of a judicial inquiry of 3 judges to inquire into matters relating to Croatian activities in Australia and also the raids on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* In the 4 weeks since the Attorney-General directed and took part in raids on offices of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation no real attempt has been made by the Government or the Prime Minister to explain why the raids took place.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has been seriously damaged, its standing eroded and its effectiveness undermined.

* Is this part of the Government's plan to destroy the **Security** Organisation?

* The Attorney-General claims that he has ministerial authority to do what he did on the night and morning of 15th and 16th March when he went to the offices of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in Canberra and Melbourne, stood over ASIO staff and took possession of information which was the property of our **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* If the Attorney-General cannot or will not show that he acted legally, we are entitled to say that he placed himself above the laws of this Parliament as set down in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act.

* That Act states in section 5 that the functions of the organisation are as follows: 
to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to **security** and, at the discretion of the Director-General, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner, as the Director-General considers to be in the interests of **security**; 
to advise Ministers, where the Director-General is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to do so, in respect of matters relevant to **security**, in so far as those matters relate to Departments of State administered by them or to authorities of the Commonwealth established by or under Acts administered by them.

* There is nothing in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act to allow the Attorney-General to give directions to the Director-General, nor does it make the Director-General responsible to the AttorneyGeneral.

* The AttorneyGeneral may be responsible for the administration of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act, but he cannot take upon himself any power or authority to administer ASIO other than in strict conformity with the Act under which ASIO was established.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is not a part of the AttorneyGeneral's Department.

* If a situation arose in which the AttorneyGeneral believed that the Director-General was not properly fulfilling his duties and exercising his functions under the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act according to the terms and conditions of appointment he would be dismissed.

* What is at stake is the effectiveness, perhaps even the survival, of our independent **Security** Organisation.

* The information is in fact taken from the computer magnetic tapes of the child endowment section of the Department of Social **Security** and transcribed on to magnetic tapes for Medibank purposes- for the distribution of these cards.

* I think that when all these procedures have been completed I will be able to report to this House that the twin goals of the Commonwealth to achieve self-management and **security** of tenure of traditional lands will well and truly have been achieved for the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.

* In Victoria, for instance, the State Liberal Government has refused to accept the principle introduced in the legislation of the last Government, which is now in opposition, that nursing home benefits for non-pensioner patients ought to be covered by health insurance at rates decided by the Department of Social **Security**, and the rates charged are considerably higher than can be justified.

* We have always asserted that just as the present system of private health insurance is purely insurance and nothing more, our scheme provides more cover, gives more benefit, gives more **security** to people in need of health protection and distributes the cost equitably.

* I know that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is having difficulties in implementing the health scheme that he has so broadly advocated around the country, but I wish that he would bring himself up to date on some of those international comparisons of which he spoke.

* Before leaving the remarks of the Minister for Social **Security**, perhaps I should refer to just one of the other quotations that he made.

* Labor in government has whittled away our international standing, abused our allies, destroyed the framework of our national **security**, taken steps to tamper with future elections, frustrated civil rights rather than protect them, and sought through massive funding of a propaganda machine to mislead the Australian electorate.

* Industry is presently enjoying record profits but not through the actions of this Government, although the Minister for Social **Security** who preceded me in this debate and other honorable members from the Government side have asserted that the Government's actions might be the reason.

* The Minister for Social **Security** a few moments ago suggested that we in the Australian Country Party, together with our Liberal colleagues, would disadvantage the wage earners of this community in order to benefit the rural sector.

* Internationally - this is a measure of comparison which the Minister for Social **Security**, the apparent shadow to the present Treasurer, affects - our interest rates are rising at one of the fastest rates in the world.

* The statistics of the OECD, that body which the Minister for Social **Security** has taken much pleasure in quoting tonight, demonstrate that in the 12 months to December 1973 inflation in Australia had risen to 13.2 per cent.

* In other words 12 months after Labor came to power our inflation rate had increased by almost 400 per cent compared with the 10-year average, and 
When the committee applied to the Commonwealth for subsidy assistance for the provision of machinery to enable its workshop to be fully utilised the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  indicated that it would not be allowed to register as a sheltered workshop with the Commonwealth until 1 July 1979 and thus would not be eligible for subsidy for machinery until that time.

* That difficulty was overcome, and the Department of Social **Security** backed down on that question.

* They were led by  Dr Coombs  and included  Mr J.  J. Spigelman, senior adviser to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  and  Mr Paddy  McGuiness, senior adviser to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Some months ago he said: 
-Apparently the shadow Minister for Social **Security** has to deny these things thrice.

* It is true enough that earlier this year the spokesman on social **security**, who still apparently retains that post, was encouraged to oppose at any cost on any issue at all.

* The Molomby report has directed strong attention to the need for a single common form of chattel **security**.

* When one reflects that chattel securities can take the form of hire purchase agreements, which are different in all States and Territories, post-dated cheques, bills of sale, mortgages, forms of guarantee, forms of indemnity, leasing agreements and various types of liens, one appreciates that there is a situation in which credit **security**, which is so important in Australia as a whole and which is in great need of ' reform, cannot be reformed by the one Parliament that can do it in a proper way, and that is this Parliament.

* But there is an even stronger reason than our own selfish ideals of **security** and a better standard of living for accepting more people into this country, and it is a profoundly mora!

* But for moral reasons as well as those of national **security**, let us not slacken in our efforts to expand this wonderful country by continuing our immigration programme.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
Can the Minister yet provide the numbers of social **security** beneficiaries who received (a) no increase and (b) a partial increase only in May 1977 due to the change in the means test preventing the conversion of certain incomes to assets in November 1976.

* I am of the opinion that the Department of Social **Security** is deliberately hindering members in the performance of their duties.

* It is a direct result of this Department's mean economic policies and its punitive attitude to those people who are adversely affected by those policies that the average back bench member is required to spend so much of his time acting as a go-between on behalf of his constituents with the Department of Social **Security** or explaining as best he can the policies of that Department to sorely aggrieved constituents.

* Many employees of the Department of Social **Security** owe their inspired ignorance to this sort of government irresponsibility and insensitivity.

* Recently in the course of handling a constituent's social **security** problem I had the occasion to talk to a departmental officer whose job, I believe, is to handle problems of this nature.

* The officer created what apparently was misapprehension about what the Department of Social **Security** is supposed to do.

* I just want to make it clear from the start that social **security** payments have nothing to do with need.

* There is no mention of need in the Social **Security** Act.'

* As well tonight I would like to discuss the question of proper identification for social **security** benefits.

* The third matter to which I want to tefer relates to something about which I wrote to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  that is, wheel chairs.

* The last matter I wish to raise is also a matter for the consideration of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I again raise a protest on behalf of the Opposition at the way in which I, as Opposition spokesman on health and social **security**, and all honourable members on this side of the Parliament are being forced to debate a document which is one of the most important documents that has been tabled in this Parliament in many years.

* This White Paper, as has been said by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  contains virtually what will be in the Bills to be presented in two or three weeks time.

* Of course, they are concerned not only about the welfare policies of the Labor Government but also about its defence and **security** policies.

* The other point I should like to make in this respect is that surely anxiety will be expressed by the Returned Services League and the other exservice organisations which are so concerned about repatriation matters, that there is not a compulsory **security** check or clearance on any member of the staff of the Labor Government Ministers.

* This seems to me to be a very dangerous gap in our **security** requirements.

* However, **security** concerns the RSL and the ex-service organisations which will receive the extra benefits in certain forms.

* Their members fought for the **security** of Australia.

* A lot of people, not only from Australia, I repeat, but also from the United States of America, paid dearly for our **security**.

* Again, I did not ask the question for some explicit or implicit partisan reason but because I believe that this Parliament needs such hard facts in order to debate intelligently and sensibly the **security** options open to it and to this country.

* Further, Parliament will be required to evaluate the Hope review on protective **security**.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
I also believe that the Department should not be retrenching employees but should be carrying out a programme of expansion.

* They should be like permanent members of the Services who know that when they finish one job they will still have **security** and permanency of employment.

* **Security** needs a little bit of attention himself judging from that interjection.

* Our national **security** has been jeopardised.

* The Minister now accepts that the North-West Cape installation is essential to Australia's **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has informed me that  Ms Learner  was appointed on 27 May 1975 as a consultant to the Social Welfare Commission.

* I have written to the Minister for Social **Security** to request that  Ms Learner  consult with the appropriate education authorities.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: _ (1) Is the Australian Government subsidy for pensioners hospitalised in Western Australia approximately, $5 per day.

* They know that by electing those who sit on this side of the House they are assured of the **security** of this nation.

* The difference between those who sit on the opposite side and those who sit on this side of the House is that we on this side worry about people and about the future **security** of this nation.

* 5 to which the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** supplied an answer in the House of Representatives  Hansard  dated 24 May 1977.

* The completion of reciprocal arrangements on social **security** with countries such as Italy is a matter of high priority.

* These principles include equality of treatment under the social **security** legislation of each contracting party, the transferability of accrued benefits and the aggregation of periods of residence, employment or insurance in determining entitlement to rates of benefit.

* An automatic fire detection system and a **security** alarm system will be provided.

* That was the reaction yesterday of South Australia's Community Welfare Minister,  Mr Payne,  to the announcement by the Social **Security** Minister,  Senator Guilfoyle,  that the Federal Government would cease to provide funds for the Australian Assistance Plan after 12 months from 1 July.

* Now, as the inflation rate comes down and people are receiving some of their own funds, we are achieving a stability and a sense of **security** for families and people who have benefited by some of the previous Government's programs.

* The report showed what inflation does to them and how it erodes their **security**.

* I stress that these amendments have the intention of attempting to strengthen the power of the Parliament vis-a-vis the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, whereas the purpose of this legislation is to strengthen ASIO's powers visavis the Parliament.

* Sutch said his suspicions (which were not mentioned in court as Sutch was not called as a witness) were aroused when he learned from Crown evidence that the **Security** Intelligence Service (SIS) knew of his last meeting with the Russian, and its agents lay in waiting before apprehending him.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Once again we think it would be not unreasonable to withdraw the Bill or to take out those parts and rethink this matter so that the concession could remain.

* I think the whole community accepted the principle of a concession to people on lower incomes, to people on social **security** benefits of various sorts or to migrants after the first two or three months of their arrival in the country- I forget the period, but it is not very relevant.

* Does the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  say that his proposals for superannuation or for old age pensions or something else were not the important matters?

* Both of those alterations are sensible ones and I congratulate the Minister for Social **Security** for introducing them.

* Two-thirds of the workforce in the ACT are employed by the Government, giving them a remarkable degree of **security** and affluence.

* Whilst it can be argued that the policies of this Government have gone a long way towards undermining the **security** and affluence of workers generally, tonight I point out the degree to which this Government has undermined the **security** and affluence of its own employees.

* I will not spend the time of the House on the threat to the **security** of employment entailed in the management-instigated retirement proposals of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill, which once again threatens the affluence and **security** of tenure of Commonwealth public servants.

* This threat to **security** once again affects Fourth Division employees, but it can affect also other officers who joined the Service late in life or who for one reason or another retire early from the Service.

* I ask the Government: What type of **security** can a retired public servant feel and what sort of justice is operating when, because he was a Commonwealth public servant rather than a State or authority servant, he is falling further behind in his standard of living, which even under the new rates that recently came into force can hardly be called affluent?

* As a former member of a Ministry - not of a Cabinet; I do not think he ever reached that rank in the previous Government - the honourable member knows that in that document there would be statements based on **security** and therefore they could not be released.

* I invite honourable members to contrast my attitude and my actions in relation to informing members of the Opposition on these matters with the attitude of members of the Opposition who, when in government, denied to me and to the then Leader of the Opposition any information relating to **security** and defence matters.

* These arrangements provide for interest on the securities to be paid over the counter by banks in overseas financial centres when the holder of the **security** presents his interest coupon, and the bank is reimbursed by the borrower or his agent.

* Our effort in this area so far has been fairly impressive, but the significance of this area to Australia from the commercial, **security** and cultural points of view is permanent and important.

* Firstly, we could increase our aid provision - which is steadily increasing - for these near neighbours in Asia, provided always that the success of their development programmes does not run counter to Australia's **security**.

* -1 find that suggestion about 'permitted' very objectionable because very often there is a basic assumption that civil liberties in Australia is what is left over after the police, Customs, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and various other authorities have had their go.

* But, once the dragnet has been cast so wide that it encompasses unlawful and lawful activities and the Government says 'They are to be regarded as part of the process of surveillance', that is the first step towards some kind of police state where the rights of the citizen are qualified and where the rights of the **security** organisation are unlimited; where the Parliament keeps putting restraints on itself and keeps giving carte blanche to somebody else.

* There is a variety of resolutions being discussed within the outer councils of the United Nations at this moment and it might therefore be more helpful to the House if I indicated the Government's view which is at present reflected in United Nations resolutions already standing which we supported at the last General Assembly and to which we spoke in the **Security** Council.

* The resolution in the **Security** Council, of course, was adopted unanimously.

* These are fundamental to our views and policies, past, present and future, and the policy once we came to power gained international reflection in the resolutions of the United Nations that I have referred to- the resolutions in the General Assembly and in the **Security** Council.

* As 1 indicated in replies to Questions Without Notice on 28th February (Hansard, pages 33, 35 and 39), every member of my personal staff has undergone a **security** clearance.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)-  I pay him credit- and the Government have accepted the wisdom of what the Senate has done with respect to this Bill.

* The Minister for Social **Security** made some comments about the emotionalism of this debate, but he himself was somewhat prey to this when he talked about one of the disgraceful features of the private health funds.

* -The two Bills being debated are under the administration of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and her Department.

* The Homeless Persons Bill was one of the small but valuable initiatives taken by the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  when he was the Minister for Social **Security** in the former Labor Government.

* I believe that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has done her homework on the figures she has given for the Budget, which indicate that she believes that there will be an increased allocation of 12 per cent this year.

* If  a borrower fails to meet his obligations there may be difficulty in realising on the **security**.

* This bank could undertake the heavy task of rural reconstruction, rural re-organisation and rural rehabilitation on the **security** of a mortgage over land and capital assets.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1979: 
1 ) How many social **security** cheques were reported as lost or stolen during each of the years 1975-76 to 1977-78.

* I know from working in my electorate and the responsibilities that I have as the local member that in relation to the services offered in Parramatta by the Department of Social **Security** the complaints about delays today are no different to those that I received previously when the Labor Government was in office.

* My question is directed to  the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Will the Minister remove doubts and stop speculation that it is his intention to torpedo a scheme which, so far as church, charitable and benevolent organisations are concerned- 
In speaking to the amendment the Chief Minister also cited internal **security** as one of the powers to remain in the hands of the Commonwealth Government after self government.

* Honourable members will note that the Chief Minister referred to self government as leaving with the Commonwealth such powers as defence, internal **security** and external affairs.

* There are many of us here in this Parliament for the first time and we are constantly reminded of this by honourable members opposite, but we have seen nothing from them to lead us to the belief that our **security** of tenure is being threatened.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the  hourable  member's question: 
I have not dealt with all the points with which I wanted to deal but let me just mention the socalled Constitutional **Security** Movement which was set up in New South Wales in order to defeat the referendum on the upper House.

* He certainly should have been associated with something called a **security** movement because he was previously the  Chairman  of the Sydney Stock Exchange and he did not do anything for the people who had invested in securities.

* So then he formed what he called the Constitutional **Security** Movement.

* It is interesting to note that once the Liberal Party and the Labor Party came to a deal on the ques.ton of the upper House the Constitutional **Security** Movement went underground.

* If the committee's report has not been presented to the Government, why has the Government gone ahead with major restructuring of migrant services, including the transfer of the telephone interpreter service, the Outreach program and migrant services sections from the Department of Social **Security** to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, before receiving a report which presumably would be advising the Government on these very matters?

* -Mr Speaker, I have made the point before that this Government in making its cuts in expenditure and savings is bent on attacking those in our society least able to protect themselves- the poor, the sick, the pre-school children and those dependent on social **security** benefits.

* I turn to the cuts in the budget of Department of Social **Security**.

* While there is an obvious need for continuing surveillance to be carried out over Australian waters and the adjacent region, to create public concern that Australia is suddenly confronted with a threat from the Soviet Union or any other power serves only as a contribution to the undermining of efforts of reasonable men in all great powers to bring about a genuine relaxation of tensions and progress towards a better relationship between those powers in a position to threaten the **security** of our globe.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
As I thought I had made reasonably clear in my earlier answer, the considerations which impelled the Australian Government to send troops to Vietnam were deep and long considerations of the national interests of Australia, carried out over months, with frequent meetings of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of Cabinet and with the best military advice that could be obtained.

* of course, that we consulted closely with the United States, which also had an interest in the stability and **security** of this area - perhaps not quite so direct and close as ours but.

* nevertheless, a very great interest in the **security** of the area, as did New Zealand.

* He will remember that on 24 May last at question time he said that the Government would be giving serious consideration to implementing the resolution which was then before the United Nations **Security** Council concerning the closure of what are called Rhodesian Information Offices.

* He will remember that our permanent representative at the United Nations wrote to the SecretaryGeneral in June, after the resolution had been passed by the **Security** Council, assuring him that the necessary legislation would be introduced in the next session of the Parliament in August.

* I therefore ask him: Would such a proposal be in conflict with the reiterated resolutions of the **Security** Council?

* -Medibank comes within the administration' of the National Health Insurance Commission within the Department of Social **Security**.

* What sort of confidence, what sort of faith, can the people have in a Government which distorts the normal process of producing a document, so vital to our **security**, to serve its own purposes?

* This is what we have been led to by the Government's failure to make decisions essential to the **security** of the country at the right time and with proper foresight.

* The group received a letter dated 3 February 1976 from the Department of Social **Security** which states: 
So we have a situation in which on the one hand one department denies that the group is in a certain category and, on the other hand, another department asserts that it is.

* As this matter is urgent I am raising it tonight in the hope that one of the Ministers interested in this area will have a look at the files and not repeat this sort of brouhaha concerning definitions, which is even repeated in a letter from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* If so, did the Minister for Social **Security** seek his advice before approving these projects to ensure they conformed with activities that the Department of Manufacturing Industry is pursuing in this area through the Children 's Commission; if so, when, and what was his response; if not, why not.

* It has washed its hands of the **security** of low income earners with savings invested in savings banks at a rate of 3 per cent.

* This same man was banned from attending the rocket range by the then Labor Prime Minister,  Mr Chifley,  because he was regarded as a **security** risk.

* The diaries of **security** officers have been seized and there was a big splash in the Press on that issue.

* I do not believe we can conduct international relations on the question of peace and **security** on the discretion of a Minister, no matter how well meaning he is.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 30 May 1979: 
Does either category entail the discretion of the Minister for Social **Security** or a doctor.

* I console myself with the thought that three out of four propositions being accepted within 12 months of the argument being put is not bad for starters and I suspect from the benign way that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is looking at the moment that he will not be averse to further arguments being put on the fourth proposition.

* The title 'OASDHI' refers to that section of the United States Social **Security** Act governing payment of old age, survivors and disability insurance.

* The experience to which this article refers is as follows: 
With the **security** of all these new arrangements, the Australian beef industry will be able to plan ahead with new confidence.

* But co-operating governments and industries will exchange information on wheat policies and marketing in order to ensure that decisions affecting wheat trade are consistent with market realities and the need for stability and improved world food **security**.

* Firstly, the Government, I as the Minister for Social **Security** and my Department, are concerned to establish any cases where people are illegally obtaining unemployment benefits.

* Our experience in the Department of Social **Security** is that of course some people abuse trust and try to obtain illegally benefits to which they are not entitled.

* The Minister for Social **Security**, through the Social Welfare Commission and the Australian Assistance Plan, also is assisting local government.

* In Kingston in May 1975 Commonwealth Heads of Government (including Australia) decided unanimously in favour of providing immediate financial assistance to the new Government of Mozambique if it decided to comply with mandatory sanctions imposed by the United Nations **Security** Council in respect of Rhodesia, and endorsed u 'recommendation that an initiative should be taken by Commonwealth Governments at the United Nations to establish a program of assistance for Mozambique in terms of Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter'.

* The United Nations **Security** Council subsequently adopted a unanimous resolution calling on members to assist Mozambique to compensate it for its action in applying sanctions against Rhodesia.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: 
Honourable members will recall that the Governor General in his Speech on 17 February said it is the Government's immediate objective to bring inflation under control so that there can again be jobs for all who want to work.

* In the meantime the Government is proceeding with a review of the income **security** system as a whole, including effectiveness of guaranteed minimum income proposals in overcoming poverty.

* The Government is concerned that a few people, apparently encouraged by the administrative difficulties created for the Department of Social **Security** by the high level of unemployment, are attempting to defraud the Department by making multiple claims for unemployment benefit or drawing benefit while working.

* I suppose this is all right in the ordinary run of the mill activities of the Government but in no circumstances can it be justified when it concerns the **security** of the nation.

* Will he discuss with the Minister for the Interior the urgent necessity of changing liquor laws which have destroyed the social and family **security** of the Yirrkala people (Question No.

* The Department of Social **Security** which compiles the statistics of unemployment benefits has provided the following most recent figures of the duration of receipt of unemployment benefit for the categories in which they are available in respect of (a) the area covered by the Bendigo Office of the CES and (b) Australia as a whole.

* A person could not get **security** of tenure.

* Labor will not cut the standards of the people in social **security**, health and welfare because of economic pressures.

* Sir George  Godber, the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social **Security** in the United Kingdom, published a letter in the British 'Medical Journal' of 18th November 1972 in which he stated:   the number of legal abortions has increased greatly but seems to be reaching a more stable level.

* How many occasions over the past 6 years has the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation intercepted (a) mails or (b) telephone conversations (i) with and (ii) without, Ministerial knowledge, written authority or approval.

* From the very establishment of the state of Israel no country- not even the United States, Israel's staunchest ally- has been able to guarantee Israel's **security**.

* For these are the new political realities in the Middle East which were created by  Mr Sadat's  historic visit to Jerusalem last November; any Arab leader who is prepared to embark on a genuine peace initiative in the Middle East, based on the full recognition of Israel and her vital **security** needs, must repudiate the destructive designs of the Arab rejectionist front of the PLO and Gaddafi kind.

* The right honourable gentleman will have noticed that according to the Estimates, spending on the operations of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in 1971-72 will rise by $783,000, or 22 per cent.

* House did accept that in social **security** matters his heart was far ahead of his head.

* I would have liked him to develop that subject a bit further and to ask him whether he would have expected the supporting fathers to stay home and look after the children on the same social **security** payments that were paid to the widowed mothers.

* However, as I have said, he is rather disarming when he makes a thoughtful contribution on social **security** matters.

* I heard him challenge the honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Keogh)  to a debate in the Bowman electorate on the question of social **security**.

* I should like him to come to the electorate of Scullin and debate with me his Government's record in social **security** as compared with our Government's record on social **security**.

* In other words, an attempt has been made to give these persons in the social **security** field some real value for what they need.

* In my electorate of Scullin, at the Northlands centre, is a local branch of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I put some time into that area of social **security** because so often the pension aspect of these social **security** measures overshadows everything else.

* In social **security** measures these have no real place.

* If the social **security** pensioner or beneficiary receives a proper amount there is no need for these transitory fringe benefits to be used.

* In increasing the amount of pension we have taken a step forward in improving the lot of the pensioner and recipient of social **security** benefits.

* It provides jobs and **security** for almost half of the Australian workforce.

* The Government this year will be spending a massive 25 per cent of its total outlay in social **security** and welfare.

* The attendant immediately reported his sighting to the **security** guard on duty at the blast furnace gate.

* What I suggest is that the capacity to call on the nuclear weapon would mean that it would not be used and it would mean that the identity and **security** of Australia could still be maintained.

* I hope that people will realise that the **security** of Australia and New Zealand may still in the last ultimate horrible reality depend upon the maintenance of that special relationship.

* The electorate is composed of some 54,000 citizens of this Commonwealth who lead their daily lives like most Australians, who want the things most Australians want - the same opportunities to own their homes, to educate their children and to enjoy some **security**.

* He will remember telling my colleague that in no case did the Public Service Board advise him that existing staff ceilings would result in inadequate control of payments made by the Department of Social **Security**.

* I also ask whether he noticed that yesterday the Minister for Social **Security** stated that she had direct communication with the Prime Minister during the past year on the matter of staff numbers in her Department and that she believed that further staff was necessary to enable her Department to give an effective and efficient service.

* The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  certainly has one record - an unenviable one - to his credit, namely, that alone he has notched up the discovery of more Communists in Australia than the sum of all **security** agencies in the whole of the Western world, including such democratic republics, which he upholds, as South Africa and Rhodesia.

* 1 find particularly interesting the stress placed by the honourable member for Mackellar on the subject of **security** and the need to ensure that the **security** of Australia is not breached.

* On one occasion he was able to breach **security** arrangements in this country, going in but not going out.

* As the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  has pointed out on more than one occasion, the ex-Minister decided at some stage many years ago to breach the **security** arrangements at the Garden Island Naval Dockyard.

* I can only say that it is a little late now to remonstrate with us although, in fairness, I appreciate the genuine way in which the honourable member for Mackellar as Minister for Social Services did try to apply many farreaching changes to the system of social **security**, or social services as it was then known.

* If we do adjust the system I apprehend that there will be widespread pressures for the general adjustment of payments which are received by social **security** beneficiaries.

* I note from the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that this procedure commenced on 13 January.

* In this respect I am not in any way criticising the officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service office or the Social **Security** office in my electorate.

* Looking at the Department of Social **Security**, one finds that when people in receipt of pensions move from one State to another the transfer of their pension entitlements takes some months.

* The availability or proximity of an office of the Department of Social **Security** or Commonwealth Employment Service affects people in gaining satisfaction from Government departments.

* I congratulate the Government on the establishment of a number of new offices for both the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security**.

* The nearest office of the Department of Social **Security** to Echuca is 50 miles away, in either Shepparton or Bendigo.

* I am pleased to say that the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has agreed to the establishment of a Commonwealth Employment Service office in Echuca but so far the Department of Social **Security** has not agreed to establish an office there.

* I asked the Minister for Social **Security** what was happening with the suggestion that pensions and benefits be paid into bank accounts.

* On checking with the Department of Social **Security** today I was told that it is still not available.

* Finally,  Mr Speaker,  advantage is being taken of the opportunity provided by this Bill to insert a machinery clause in the principal Act to permit the Director-General of Social **Security** to delegate his power to approve grants.

* As I have previously informed the House, a working party of officers of the Departments of Social **Security** and the Treasury has been looking into ways of overcoming the financial difficulties being experienced by organisations constructing homes for the aged, because of rising building costs.

* Action is being taken by the Department of Social **Security** to identify those cases where departmental records indicate that a pensioner over 70 years of age could be entitled to a consumer price index related increase.

* Amendments proposed in the Bill will ensure that the Department of Social **Security** has power to effect recovery of sickness benefit payments once compensation has been received for the same incapacity in respect of which sickness benefits have been paid.

* This is carried out through the provision of hostel accommodation, the payment of social **security** benefits, and English language tuition and other orientation.

* They are used freely in business, they provide a link with one's neighbours, and in many cases they offer a tremendous **security** to lonely and isolated people.

* Telephones give families, particularly the women and children, a sense of **security** so necessary in remote areas.

* I know the comfort and the feeling of **security** that a telephone or a 2-way radio brings to the people in remote areas.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) There is a reciprocal agreement on social **security** between Australia and New Zealand.

* In broad terms this enables people who move permanently from one country to the other to receive the social **security** pensions and benefits of the country in which they are living and allows people temporarily in one country to receive the social **security** benefits of the country in which they are ordinarily resident.

* I refer particularly to a statement made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in respect of projects approved for funding under the Aged and Disabled Persons' Homes Act and the Aged Persons Hostels Act, which relate to homes for the aged.

* The Minister said that the Department of Social **Security** has applications before it to provide accommodation for 25 000 people in that area alone.

* This problem is highlighted by the statement of the Minister for Social **Security** that her Department has applications for hostel type accommodation to house 25 000 people.

* In fact, the Department of Social **Security** is now operating on a 3 year program.

* I think that if we are to get good men of high calibre we must offer these people some assurance that there will be **security** of office, that they will not be employed on a year to year basis, that at least they will be there for a substantial period of time.

* For the information of honourable members I present the third main report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty entitled 'Social/Medical Aspects of Poverty in Australia', together with a statement by the Minister for Social **Security** relating to that report.

* In the absence of a Declaration of a State of Emergency in Eritrea, which would indicate a serious deterioration in internal **security**, it could not be said that a state of near civil war exists in Eritrea.

* Contract to Inter-city **Security** (Question No.

* That compares with 1.82 per cent of the total figure of funds available to the Department of Social **Security** spent on administrative and salaries, ($87m out of $4,772m) and, as you said earlier in your speech, that is 'not inordinately high'.

* May I, at this point, quote from a statement made by the Minister for Social **Security**, the  Hon.

* It has also meant that the skilled work force which is essential to a sound shipbuilding industry has not been given the confidence and long term **security** which is required in order to ensure productivity and the maintenance of skills - again caused by the Labor Government.

* -We are currently considering ways in which social **security** recipients could make regular contributions towards tax payments through the Department of Social **Security**.

* When we speak of fostering these matters, we have in mind the necessity for them to be integrated in a national **security** policy.

* The fact is that international **security** issues now are on such a scale that they demand new approaches.

* The outlook for Australia's **security** is one in which threats of a traditional nature are not visible.

* All this requires a very new way of perceiving national, regional and global **security**.

* What we need is a national strategy which integrates disarmament and arms control objectives as essential parts of national **security** policy.

* Arms control as a new focus of national **security** policy ought thus to be central to relations with our neighbours.

* The basis for Australia's **security** in our region must be sound and strong, but this is beyond the Government's competence.

* It is time we fostered co-operation with our neighbours and fostered an approach to **security** issues giving a bigger place to arms control and disarmament.

* These are not the antithesis of **security**, they ought to be the essence of **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Did the officer who represented the Department of Social **Security** on the interdepartmental committee concerned with selecting a computer for the Australian Bureau of Statistics seek the approval of the Department or the Public Service Board before taking employment with the successful tenderer.

* Which departments, other than the Department of Social **Security**, were represented on the committee.

* asked the Minister for  Social **Security**,  upon notice: 
b) will be a risk to **security** in times of emergencies such as bushfires.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What is the Minister's attitude to the recommendation of the Poverty Commission that the involvement of the Commonwealth Employment Service with unemployment benefits be restricted to providing certificates of unemployability in the way a doctor does for sickness benefit so that unemployment beneficiaries would deal directly with offices or agencies of the Department of Social **Security** in the same way as other beneficiaries.

* It does not know; it will take a punt; it will take a guess; it will take a risk with the livelihood and **security** of the people of this country and just hope that it works out right.

* We can look towards 1979-80 with no sense of optimism, no sense of **security** or encouragement at all.

* In reply to the first part of the question, as the Prime Minister said last night the plan is for most of the combat element to be withdrawn by Christmas but that plan does presuppose that a small combat element will remain for the **security** of the base, stores and the logistic personnel who will remain for packing and dispatching of stores and equipment.

* The Labor Premier of South Australia, on his own initiative but with the approval of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  appointed the Prices Commissioner in that State to examine doctors' fees.

* Social  **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  seeking hi?

* The Minister for Social **Security** refused the request.

* Because of the ceiling placed by the Minister for Social **Security** upon the benefits that can be paid by an organisation, when a claim is lodged with a benefit organisation it is able to reimburse the insured patient only to the extent of $35.

* I draw this matter to the attention of the House this evening and ask that the Minister for Social **Security** once again look at this question.

* Again, in line with other decisions relating to social **security** and repatriation benefits generally, this will be part of budgetary decisions .

* Many moves have already been made by this Government to take the Repatriation Department more and more into the social **security** field.

* These are all moves towards putting the Repatriation Department more and more into the social **security** field.

* That this House censures the Government for jeopardising Australian **security** and injuring our reputation as a reliable ally by: 
the actios of the Prime Minister in making public information concerning Australia's **security**, for the purpose of relieving the Government from pressures exerted on it to withdraw all troops, contrary to its stated intention, by persons both in the Government andoutside the Government, and for failing to adhere to the Cabinet system by permitting statements by Ministers about matters outside their own ministerial responsibilities, and which are offensive to other countries.

* He then gave the selected journalists in his room classified **security** information about an Australian defence intelligence system which is regarded by defence experts as critical to this nation's defence requirements.

* There is a clear formula to follow when asked about **security** information.

* That fact has not, however, restricted the development of internal **security** procedures for the protection of aircraft from the crime of hijacking.

* Appropriate **security** measures have been put into force at airports in Australia, lt would not be in the public interest to disclose what those measures are.

* Our national **security** will be enhanced as the economies of our Asian neighbours are strengthened and the processes of government in those countries achieve maturity.

* To the extent that our aid can help to achieve those aims, it becomes as effective a defender of our **security** as of some of our defence spending.

* From 195 7 to 1976 there were 15 known **security** breaches at nuclear installations and facilities in the United Kingdom, the 
United States, Germany and Canada.

* When we come to the question of penalties we see that between 1975 and 1976, 12 United States companies were fined for non-compliance with **security** regulations.

* While provision of **security** adequate to guarantee against terrorist intrusion - honourable members should think about that- is theoretically possible .

* We on this side of the House happen to believe that regional **security** and regional discussions in matters pertaining to foreign policy are a fundamental way by which the whole of this nation 's foreign policy should be approached.

* The second point is that it is important that the Australian Government should take positive initiatives in public and not just in private places to demonstrate its concern for the maintenance of regional **security** in our particular part of the world.

* 17.7 of 31 May this year, not the questionable statistical returns that come from health insurance funds to the Department of Social **Security** which cannot check their veracity.

* If certain exotic breeds of sheep, goats and cattle are considered to be of value to Australia, will a maximum **security** quarantine station be required to permit their entry.

* Is a study being made of the desirability and feasibility of a maximum **security** quarantine station and diagnostic laboratory for Australia.

* This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure, so far as it can, that passports are not issued to persons likely to threaten the national **security** and public order of another country or the rights and welfare of its citizens.

* In brief, these are, with certain exceptions, persons who are not married and who have not reached the age of 18 years, unless the consent of persons having custodial rights has been obtained; persons in respect of whom the authorised officer has reason to believe that there is in force a warrant for arrest issued in Australia; persons whom the authorised officer has reason to believe are required to remain in Australia under a court order, or under a condition of parole or of recognisance, surety or bail bond; persons who owe money to the Commonwealth as a result of circumstances arising from previous overseas travel; persons whom the authorised officer believes already to be in possession or control of an Australian passport in force- unless there are special reasons- and persons in respect of whom the Minister has decided that issue of a passport would threaten **security** or welfare in another country.

* -The honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett),  made the point that the greatest enemy of social **security** benefits is inflation.

* I think it is necessary to view that statement with which every member of this House would concur in the context of the improvements in social **security** benefits which have been achieved over the last 3 years and which are being taken further in the legislation now before the House.

* In December 1972 when the present Government came to office social **security** benefits, the age pension most notably, were subject to a very rigorous means test indeed.

* This is so when we look at this part of the Bill and when we look at the fact which is being secluded from the view of the public that the industrial section of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has now been re-established and is operating again.

* It is surprising in view of all the hawks on the other side- quite a number of new hawks became members of this House in 1975- that in all the discussions on the shipbuilding industry, the need to preserve employment in Australia and the need for economic recovery, none of those hawks made reference to the second part of the submission by the Department of Defence to the Tariff Board in 1971 which said that in a long term international conflict a major shipbuilding industry was vital to our **security**.

* When the law regarding drunkenness was taken off the statute book the Government said that it would replace the practice of having people arrested for drunkenness by providing a pick up service and a sobering up service with social **security** sort of assistance.

* and (3) Discussions related to the question of a reciprocal agreement on social **security** with  the  Maltese Government have not yet been completed.

* It is interesting to note that the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1973 was introduced by the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  whereas the Act is administered by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* It is somewhat curious that the Minister for Labour was successful in wresting the introduction of this Bill from the Minister for Social **Security**.

* However, I expect that it will be only a matter of time before the Minister for Social **Security** asserts his authority over the Minister for Labour and takes over from him in this area.

* Of course, we recently have had our attention drawn to a serious matter which concerned the raid by the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  on the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in Canberra and Melbourne.

* As with other measures, this Bill cannot be viewed in isolation; it cannot be divorced from overall budgetary considerations in spite of the Prime Minister's extraordinary statement in his policy speech that social welfare and social **security** as a whole no longer would be subject to financial or budgetary considerations.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Records are not maintained to show the breakdown by electoral divisions of expenditure under major programs of the Department of Social **Security**.

* **Security** is normally by Contract of Sale, but can be converted to mortgage later.

* Depending on deposit availability, **security** is either contract of sale or mortgage.

* The two distinguished gentlemen who have spoken have shown that at least the Liberal and National Country Parties still hold firm to the idea of looking after the safety and **security** of this country, not only in relation to its defence but also in relation to its economy.

* I only hope that the people of Australia will very soon be given an opportunity to show that they also are concerned about the safety and **security** of this country, both from an economic and a defence point of view.

* I believe that they have shown a remarkable restraint in not taking action in Timor when the **security** of many of their people has been threatened.

* Surely we must anticipate that the Indonesians cannot remain oblivious for ever to what is happening in Timor if they have regard to the safety and **security** as well as the future of their people and their country.

* I believe that unless pretty drastic and positive action is taken by countries in the area, including Australia, we can anticipate that the Indonesians must act in the interests of their own safety and **security**.

* Prior to that we had a gradual increase in this type of **security**.

* Honourable members might ask why there was a sudden upsurge in this type of **security**.

* Therefore, we believe that adequate medical care comes into the field of social **security** and, as such, should be funded by a system of progressive taxation, as are all other social services- that is, payment which depends on the ability to pay.

* The campaign has become vicious and personal, as instanced by the personal attacks on the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* We are dealing with a matter of social **security**.

* An ex-Prime Minister on the Opposition side agreed a fortnight ago in an article in 'Nation Review' that this was a matter of social **security**.

* Highly specialised and sophisticated engineering systems - that is, mechanical, electrical and hydraulic services - will be installed to cope with the stringent design criteria of microbiological **security** to specified areas.

* It seems as though I spend most of my time in the Parliament standing at this box and being confronted with the not unpleasant but harassed face of my friend the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  while talking about his health scheme, which is what this debate is about.

* Out of any logic, apart from philosophical and other objections we have to this scheme, we would be entitled to oppose it because .we are being asked to agree to legislation which provides for the imposition of a levy without the Minister for Social **Security** telling the nation and the Parliament the cost of his health scheme.

* At the same time bulk billing will be abolished and many sections of social **security** beneficiaries those estimated 800,000 people who do not lit into the definition of eligible at the moment- will suddenly have this increase imposed upon them.

* Does the fact that 85 per cent is mentioned in this clause mean that the optimistic hopes of the Minister will not be realised in relation to the ineligible poor- all those people on social **security** benefits who do not come within the definition of eligibility?

* I simply point out now that the objective to which both Parties claim to be working with regard to social **security** benefits is a pension that will be one-quarter of average weekly earnings.

* Has his Department issued directives or guidelines in each year since 1 970 that Australian citizens of certain ethnic backgrounds are not to be issued Australian passports or other travel documents without a **security** clearance.

* If so, (a) what ethnic backgrounds are the subject of such directives or guidelines, (b) how many Australian citizens have not been issued with an Australian passport because of their failure to obtain a **security** clearance, and (c) what procedures exist for an Australian citizen to appeal against or seek a review of such a decision.

* I hope that, in a spirit of co-operation with the Queensland Government, we will see a solution to this problem and a sense of **security** given not only to investors in that society but also to those who have invested in permanent building societies generally.

* As to the honourable gentleman's suggestion that the Government should consider proclaiming that part of the Act, I just take note of it 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
In those circumstances, with the borrower having gone bankrupt, one would normally expect that the creditors would immediately take steps to recover the money owing to them by selling the shares that they held as collateral.

* Enough damage had already been done to overseas confidence, ft was essential that there should not be a crash in the value of the shares which were held by Minsec and which had been given as **security** for borrowings.

* It appears that a **security** risk is alleged if opium poppies are grown more widely than simply in Tasmania as at present.

* There are, and have been set out in reports, detailed **security** arrangements that are given effect to in Tasmania where these poppies are presently grown.

* He agrees with the comment that I have made that it would be most desirable, provided satisfactory **security** arrangements were madeand I believe that they can be made- if the resources were actually widened and it were made possible for more growers to enter the market.

* I believe that the **security** steps that we would all demand and see as necessary could be taken and, as a result, we could produce this product for world purposes, supplying not only our own needs but also the needs of other countries- needs that, from what I have read, seem to be very apparent and immediate.

* The Minister for Social **Security** was in the House when I made that rebuttal on a point of misrepresentation.

* In this House, because the conventions prevent us doing that I shall content myself with saying that yesterday the Minister for Social **Security** behaved without honour, without decency, and without a shred of honesty.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The following recommendations of the Myers Inquiry into Unemployment Benefit Policy and Administration of July 1977 which have direct relevance to the Department of Social **Security** have been implemented in full orin part:  5,9, II, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19,21,22,23,25,27,29,31, 32,33,35,36 and 37.

* Many recommendations have no direct relevance to the Department of Social **Security** and in some cases the general procedures have been improved to the extent that the specific recommendations are no longer appropriate.

* We have had ample evidence in discussions of matters relating to the aviation industry of the considerable threat posed to the **security** and well-being of aviation passengers in the truncation of standing safety facilities which have been a feature of our industry for very many years.

* Is this the magnificent contribution to job **security** in this country that the Minister has been talking about, namely, policies of the investment allowance at a time of high and worsening unemployment designed to aggravate that problem in manufacturing industry?

* People receiving unemployment, sickness and special benefits from the Department of Social **Security**.

* Further, it has used the Bureau as an associate of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation which has a completely different charter and set of functions.

* Presumably, it had also the not inadequate facilities of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* He seized on this as a legitimate reason for using the Bureau as an agency of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* There are 2 discussion papers ready for the Minister's concerned, namely the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* When announcing the 3-year program the Minister for Social **Security** said that those organisations which had been announced as being included in this program could proceed with certain construction.

* and (2) It is a fact that the World President of the Associated Country Women of the World was informed by letter of 5 April 1973 by the then responsible Minister that to permit a Delegation from Rhodesia to attend its 14th Triennial Conference would be contrary to the spirit and objects of the relevant U.N. **Security** Council Resolutions concerning Rhodesia.

* The purpose of the U.N. **Security** Council Resolutions on Rhodesia is the welfare of the presently disadvantaged coloured majority of that country's population.

* There is no doubt that if the Government succeeds in hoodwinking the Australian people- God forbid that it does- it will have a change of heart immediately it gains some **security** of tenure of office.

* For too many years pensioners, particularly those whose income is almost entirely dependent on the pension, have not been given an adequate sense of **security** or social justice.

* **Security** has been denied them by the way in which successive governments have refused to set down a clear policy regarding payment of pensions according to a regular and clearly defined adjustment mechanism.

* With broken promises and short-term changes to an adjustment mechanism where is the **security** for the pensioner?

* The present government is now providing a pensioner with the **security** of knowing that each 6 months the CPI will be used as a regular adjustment mechanism by which the real value of the pension is preserved.

* I am therefore particularly pleased that this Government is to proceed with a review of the income **security** system as a whole, including the effectiveness of guaranteed minimum income proposals in an endeavour to overcome poverty.

* A great deal has been said about the way in which this legislation tries to move towards making this **security** organisation an organisation which is more subject to ministerial authority.

* So it is quite possible to conceive of a situation in which the DirectorGeneral of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation was, in a real sense, pursuing a quite different course of action than was the policy of a particular government.

* There will be no peace in the Middle East until there is not only a Jewish but also a Palestinian national home- separate national homes- and there will be no **security** and there will be no safety for people in the Lebanon until that happens.

* He moved that the Budget be rejected, for 5 reasons, among them: because it produces no programs for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**.

* Only in the case of national **security**, important cases of the national interest, or where freedom of an individual's privacy are involved, should actions be taken in secrecy in a democratic society.

* This Act specifies that all information held in Government files will be open to public inspection with the exception of information relating to national **security** or the privacy of the individual.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
So might the petition read, were my little daughter, Fiona, able to give expression to her situation.

* But in her absolute and complete innocence, she is unable to communicate in any way at all, but she knows' her own familiar things and, as a loved member of her family, is intended to remain in that circle of **security**.

* I hope that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who is sitting at the table will sympathetically examine the problem and bring forward positive initiatives which will receive the commendation of this House.

* In its statement to the **Security** Council on  7  February, reporting the air strikes against military installations in the south of North Vietnam, America insisted that its object in South Vietnam, while resisting aggression, is to achieve a peaceful settlement maintained by the presence of international peacekeeping machinery and that it would not allow the situation to be changed by terror and violence.

* The Government recognises that we must be involved in these matters because it believes that our environment will change and that, therefore, it is necessary to be involved in those changes to see that they occur in ways that will advance our cause and the general **security** of our region.

* It is unfashionable to talk of fifth columnists and the adverse effect that thenactivities are having on Australian **security**, both internal and external, yet this is perhaps the one deficiency of the White Paper- its failure to discuss those in our midst who for traitorous reasons or out of idealistic ideological allegiance to some new Utopian world order would gladly sell us down the drain for 2 bob.

* I have spoken previously in this House on defence, welcoming government initiative to improve the **security** of our nation.

* All that remains is for us to get on with the job 
-We have just seen an Actors Equity performance in this House completely irrelevant to the matter under discussion, which is not surprising because the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  even though he has been the shadow Minister for Social **Security** for nearly 3 years, still does not understand what Medibank is about.

* Even the LiberalNational Country Party Government in New South Wales, in a 2-page advertisement in all Sunday newspapers last weekend stated: 
When the funds submitted their costing to the Department of Social **Security** it was found that it was impossible to cost the scheme.

* He has expressed concern in the past about the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* At least we have some opportunity in this House to discuss in a calm and rational way what is one of the most serious pieces of legislation to come before this Parliament and that is a Bill to make a new Act for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* We know that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Cotter)  is so concerned about the **security** of this nation.

* ASIO are to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to **security** and to communicate any such intelligence to the appropriate persons.

* **Security** is defined as the protection of the people from espionage, sabotage, subversion, active measures of foreign intervention or terrorism.

* We have here a very dangerous situation where an agency with powers that go beyond any existing protections of civil liberties may on suspicion of a possible and ultimate threat to **security** broadly defined, make forced entry to premises, search and remove documents, bug conversations and intercept mail.

* It has developed its own concept of freedom and **security**.

* These powers are the very forces that in themselves will threaten our **security** and the collective will of the people to defend their interests.

* The proposed Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act is based on a belief that the Australian people need to be more seriously protected against terrorism, especially those forms of terrorism that are manipulated by foreign forces.

* The Australian people should be protected against terrorism, but the best form of such defence is to build up a strong social system of **security** where the people are prepared to defend the common interests.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* So it seems to me that this is a clause in a Bill which is going to affect **security** of tenure.

* I am hoping that once again the Party will come to the rescue and will see that people, particularly the miners of Western Australia, are given the **security** of tenure to which they are entided.

* My colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will introduce the necessary legislation shortly.

* A statutory fund generally provides **security** for the liability of policies relating to a large number of superannuation schemes and is invested in a wide range of public and private sector assests, all of which are available to cover the liabilities in respect of all policies secured on that fund.

* Later I want to deal with the administrative side of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* Whilst some of them may not be physically powerful, the very impression created by a police force which is capable and efficient gives one the feeling that one has **security** and this is a feeling which permeates the whole community.

* As its name implies, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is a mysterious organisation.

* I am a member of the **security** police'.

* Whilst one cannot expose to the light of day everything that ASIO is doing for the sake of the defence and **security** of the country, at least there is a case to be made out for a review of its activities, particularly since there has been a great increase in its expenses in recent times without there being, from what I can see, no great increase in efficiency.

* Whilst I respect the police force and the **security** service for what they are doing, let us safeguard our democracy and ensure that things which can destroy that state of affairs that the honourable member for Mcpherson mentioned, things which we all want to see safeguarded, do not creep in.

* He served this Parliament well, particularly on committees, and especially in the areas of social **security** and Papua New Guinea affairs.

* In fact it is becoming evident that the Act that supersedes the Deposits Act is probably a better control and effects a better oversight for the **security** of the depositors than did the Deposits Act.

* As has been said, the Insurance Act 1973 is not an Act that is of monetary concern to the insurers; it provides for an oversight to be exercised by the Commonwealth through the lodgment of forms and the inspection of accounts which gives **security** to the insurer and also the depositors.

* I, for my part, certainly believe that the time has long since passed in this country when what all of us would in everyday experience regard as mere chance and nothing else should determine whether, as between 2 people who suffer an equal physical devastation, one of them is to have impacted on that physical devastation financial devastation, and the other is to have some kind of **security** for the rest of his or her life which makes the physical devastation a little easier to bear.

* I see in this bypassing, as I see in other legislation, evidence of another example of what I think is a disturbing trend in social welfare legislation and something about which I intend to speak in this House on the estimates for the Department of Social **Security**, that is, the tendency to institutionalise our social welfare services.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The only point on which 1 agree with the honourable member for Wills is that we do not get enough time to discuss the defence estimates when we have only 10 minutes in which to speak.

* In the short time left to me I want to say something to honourable members and the Australian public about 2 documents which were produced by the American **Security** Council, one in 1967 arid one last month, entitled The Changing Strategic Military Balance USA v. USSR'.

* J remind the House that, even in 1967, the American **Security** Council reported that the available evidence indicated that the Soviet Union had a goal of strategic superiority designed to win a nuclear war rather than merely deter one.

* I ask the Prime Minister whether he agrees that it is in the interests of Australian **security** to allow nuclear powered and conventional ships of the United States Navy to use Australian ports.

* In view of the statement by the Deputy Premier of South Australia that information made available to his Government regarding radioactive materials at Maralinga did not appear to be of such a nature that it should remain classified, will the Government now request the British Government to declassify all aspects of the Pearce report other than those details which would disclose **security** arrangements or the location of material which could constitute a public hazard?

* I refer to the Treasury, through its taxation system; the Department of Social **Security**, through its income support system; the Department of Education, through its responsibility to maintain freedom of choice in education; the Department of Health; the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; the Attorney-General's Department; the Department of Veteran's Affairs; and the department responsible for housing.

* In 1968-69, the social **security** appropriation was 17 per cent of the Budget.

* We have been lulled into a false sense of **security**.

* We decided that these social projects, important as they are, had a greater priority than the **security** of the nation.

* The first plank of the platform of the two parties which form the Government is the **security** of the nation.

* That **security** has been neglected.

* If we believe that our first duty as a government is to attend to the **security** of the nation, we should do something about the present situation.

* I hope that all members of Parliament, on both sides of this House, will adopt a bipartisan approach for the **security** and defence of Australia.

* In what other areas of Australian civilian life are **security** organisations engaged in political espionage.

* I asked him whether the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** could investigate and report on this matter and whether Australian officials could attend the trial and report on the proceedings.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* With the abolition of the means test for a pension in respect of people over 75 years and the taxing of these people, if it is expected that an amount of money will be owing to the Taxation Office by them at the end of the financial year, can any arrangement be made by the people with the Department of Social **Security** for the alleviation of this suddenly imposed burden?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Director-General advises me that when the Department of Social **Security** receives an inquiry from a member of Parliament for information about a constituent the Department accepts that the member has the authority of the person to whom the information relates to obtain it.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
While I am not aware to which specific allegations the honourable member may be referring, I am of course aware that there have been discussions at an international level on the question of the free flow of information between and within countries, as well as on the specific issue of bias in school textbooks.

* This was recently the case at the Conference on **Security** and Co-operation in Europe, the Final Act of which was signed by 35 European and North American states in Helsinki in 1 975.

* While Australia did not attend the Conference on **Security** and Co-operation in Europe the Government does support the process of which that Conference is a pan.

* Whether it is in the area of company law or **security** regulation there has been an endless litany over the last 3 months of company collapses brought about by either fraudulent transactions or collusive practices.

* Underlying all overseas governments' policies was the view that **security** of supply, balance of payments, price to consumers, social utility of investment and basic industrial organisation were too important to be left to the commercial rivalries of foreign-owned corporations.

* Proper understanding between Australia and Japan is of enormous importance to peace and **security** in the AsianPacific region.

* I cannot stress too strongly my feeling that business of Australia has in some way a debt to play a part in achieving future understanding and the future **security** of the relationship between our 2 nations.

* Of course, unless the Norfolk Islanders have some special relationship with us they do not receive social **security** benefits.

* We must give incentives to production and development and we must protect our social **security**, educate our children and guard our national **security** and welfare.

* I am reviewing the whole system of special benefits at the present time to make it a simpler arrangement and to make it a more liberal arrangement in terms of establishing eligibility, and that is consistent with things that I have done in the short time I have been Minister for Social **Security**.

* Cost: The cost of expanding the widows pension scheme to cover these people would be .at least $3Sm, on the conservative estimates of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Who would be eligible if we were to expand the widows pension scheme to cover- 
Finally, to establish beyond any doubt the credentials of this Government, I point out that in the 1 972-73 Budget the previous Liberal-Country Party Government increased expenditure on social **security** and welfare by 15.8 per cent.

* Sir, if  you read carefully the amendment moved by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  you will see that it states: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:  ( 1 ), (2) and (3) The Commissioner for Employees' Compensation has advised me that, according to the records kept in his office, no such claims have been made.

* 1 know that the recent statement by the  President  of the United States in relation to the **security** of the aviation industry has been considered by my colleague in another place as well as by the Department of Civil Aviation.

* At the same time I can assure the House that the Department of Civil Aviation and the Australian aviation industry is well aware of the problem and that very tight **security** measures are in operation in Australia.

* In no circumstances would I convey publicly what those measures are because they would then no longer be **security** measures.

* But I give the assurance that the Department is well aware of the problem and has taken active steps, in conjunction with the industry, to see that the **security** measures are enforced.

* I admit that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill is an important piece of legislation.

* It needs to be understood that the **security** requirement has become much more urgent, as advice to the 
Government had indicated.

* If these people had thrown bombs into this building, instead of pamphlets, there would have been a keener awareness by members in this building of the importance of **security** requirements.

* This practice is pursued in the interest of **security** and to protect the patient's interests against theft or loss.

* It should be noted that patients' pension entitlements are reviewed periodically by the Department of Social **Security** which may reduce or increase the amount of pension payment due according to the assets and /or income of the pensioner.

* The five Western members of the **Security** Council (United Kingdom, United States of America, France, West Germany, Canada) in 1977 advised South Africa that its constitutional proposals arising out of these consultations would not gain international approval.

* The plan, and proposals by the United Nations Secretary-General for its implementation, were later accepted by the United Nations **Security** Council as a basis for an internationally acceptable settlement that would give Namibia independence.

* In the Government's view we ought to do what we reasonably can to promote conditions there which will bring about stability and so contribute to **security** in the widest sense.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 September 1977: 
What this Minister wants the House and the people of Australia to believe- it is the most extraordinary argument I have ever heard from a lawyer- is that some terrorist whom we shall call Boris, could make himself a bomb.

* Boris goes off the wharf, takes out his little remote control button and it is not until he presses that button that the Australia **Security** Intelligence Organisation can move in and ask: 'What are you doing?'

* There would be so many unlawful activities in which he would have been involved that any **security** intelligence operation that did not have that situation covered would be grossly derelict in its duty.

* At this stage I do not want to say a great deal about the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation but I must confess that, having listened to some of the comments from the Government side and from the Senate, I feel that many questions were left unanswered by the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy).

* from open shelves to the **security** of the dispensary to be handled only by qualified staff.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  issued a statement, I think last August, in regard to this and I was hopeful that it would have presaged a relaxation of departmental practices in this regard.

* But I ask the Minister for Social **Security** whether he would consider moving, when that social services Bill is being debated, an amendment which would put the widower or deserted husband with dependent children on the same footing as the widow with dependent children.

* I do not want to relate all the details again, as I have done so previously in this House and elsewhere, which explode the sorts of exaggerated assertions which the Government has levelled from time to time about the international **security** situation, but it is relevant to start from this point and to move into our own area because the Government is constantly responding to false images which it perceives in international relations.

* The Americans made it clear from 1969 onwards that so far as regional conflicts are concerned they would expect allies such as Australia to be capable of attending to their own **security** needs.

* I inform the Committee that the Mowanjum community wrote to me in February of this year pointing out the great socially destructive effect of unemployment and other social **security** payments on the community.

* As a result I established a working party, calling in my colleagues the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  and the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  to consider that matter among other matters affecting Aboriginal employment.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** whether he is aware that material critical of the Australian health insurance program is being circulated to primary schools throughout Australia by a body describing itself as the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia.

* Applications are determined on the **security** offered, and even though a property is viable, need is forgotten.

* Existing banking institutions and pastoral firms have strained their resources to help financially the man on the land but they could not give the same assistance and **security** as could a national institution specially designed to provide long-term low-interest credit to those engaged in rural pursuits, including local district farmers, graziers and agriculturists.

* Without a treaty such as the ANZUS Treaty, Australia would not have the assurance of national **security** that it now has under that treaty.

* Were we relying on ANZUS as a treaty for our national **security**?

* And if the answer to those questions was yes, then quite clearly we had to allow the United States to have this facility so that the United States could play its part not only in the ANZUS Treaty but in world **security**- the western defence system.

* This amendment gives us the opportunity to reaffirm that we will look after the **security** of this country by means of treaties with our allies, and that we will give to our allies complete assurances that they can rely on our committed word and our willingness, at least on this side of the House, to defend Australia and to make our contributions to the western defence system.

* They have placed their case before the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and also before the Review of Post Arrival Programs and Services to Migrants.

* I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and also the Minister for Social **Security** to have a close and compassionate look at the problems of the Polish community within Australia.

* I do not mind saying that I would be prepared to swap my **security** for the **security** of some of the beneficiaries under the scheme that is being debated at the moment.

* They represent a **security** ratio of $A1,425 in assets for every $A1 of our proposed borrowing- the best **security** ever offered to overseas lenders.

* If you have attained latter years of life and would like to spend them in an elderly people's community where you are able to come and go as you please, have relations and friends visit you at any time, pursue your interests with others, form new friendships, forget the anxiety and stress of everyday life, enjoy privacy, peace, **security** and loving care, then the accommodation of ... is available to you.

* Honourable members would be staggered to see how the sense of **security** of these aged people was undermined as a result of this circular.

* For instance, another regulation states: 
The matter of public importance proposed for discussion by the House is one of great significance because it goes to the central role, of the Government and its responsibility for the **security** of the community.

* I agree with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  when she says that there is a limit to what the economic resources of this country can provide.

* As a private member I am not familiar with the **security** report which was an important element in the decision to purchase these aircraft.

* I also think that the Prime Minister should be given maximum **security**.

* Surely the people who live in a tribal setting, who depend on the tribe for their personal selfrespect and self-esteem, for their future outlook, and for their **security** and harmony in the world, are entitled to the bare minimum of environment which the tribal arrangement can so secure.

* 5m in respect of such increases since the Budget, and a further $ 12.4m is needed, mainly for essential staff increases, particularly in the Department of Social **Security** and as a consequence of the rearrangement of departmental functions which took effect on 5 December 1978.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* comments by the Department of Social **Security** which has been responsible for the administration of the program over most of the pilot period comments from State Governments comments from Local Government Authorities and their Associations comments from voluntary welfare organisations and private citizens.

* To listen to the remarks of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  one would imagine that we were talking about finance, about Budget figures and the $ 1,452m provided.

* This Minister for insecurity is taking away from the aged people of the community the **security** they formerly had under a Liberal Party-Country Party Government.

* In that letter the correspondent said: 
In the remaining minutes of my contribution to this debate I wish to refer to the AuditorGeneral's annual report, which was tabled yesterday, in which it was alleged that approximately $60m had been paid out accidently by the Department of Social **Security**.

* Such was my concern that I tried to contact the head of the Department of Social **Security** in Queensland.

* The damage caused by the explosion was small, but the occurrence highlights the need for an adequate **security** system in Parliament House.

* Honourable members will be aware that over the past 18 months increased **security** measures have been taken in and around Parliament House.

* Late last year, with the agreement of  Mr President,  a study group was established to report on all aspects of **security** in Parliament House.

* Honourable members may be assured that the Presiding Officers are maintaining a constant oversight of the **security** of Parliament House and will keep honourable members informed of future proposals.

* The wording is a summary of the United Nations **Security** Council resolution No.

* This is a crisis which is eating away at the confidence and the **security** of every citizen of Australia 
Did the Minister in particular notice a series of advertisements placed in Australian newspapers on or about 3 1 December 1974 with a large photograph of the Minister for Social **Security** which many regarded as having some political motive.

* I want to stress the fact that very important questions have been asked by the Opposition spokesman on social **security** matters of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and I very much hope that the Minister will answer those questions.

* -The **security** of Parliament House will be improved by procedures now being put into operation.

* Existing **security** measures compatible with the above arrangements, such as the scrutiny of mail by detection machines, will be continued.

* I want to give some examples of this in order to set the context in which this years' social **security** estimates were drawn up.

* The most extraordinary, although not the largest, underestimate occurs in the estimates for the Department of Social **Security**.

* Let me, first of all, give due credit to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and/or her Department because she admits that she cannot explain the fudging of the figures.

* The Department of Social **Security** is sufficiently honest to say that it cannot explain how that extraordinary figure was produced.

* Let me suggest how the sum should be done and, I suspect, how it has been done within the Department of Social **Security**.

* The second issue to which I want to allude briefly is the matter of research within the Department of Social **Security**.

* At the beginning of this session I got from the Department a rather fudged answer about the extent of monitoring and research being done by the Department of Social **Security**.

* I have talked to officers of the Department who have admitted honestly that one of the fears about research is that it will begin to reveal some of the gaps that exist in the social **security** area in this nation.

* Certainly when one looks at research publications one sees that the contribution from the Social **Security** Department is very small.

* In order to deal with the kinds of growing problems which this society is facing, particularly because the problems are changing rather dramatically I refer, for instance, to the demographic change affecting age patterns in this community- radically different policies will be needed in the social **security** field in the coming years.

* What kind of preparation and what kind of research are being done by the Social **Security** Department to prepare Australia for a very different balance of ages in the 1980s?

* There is certainly need for a much greater commitment and development of research facilities within the Department of Social **Security**.

* Senior officers of the Department of the Treasury, Social **Security** and Manufacturing Industry.

* While not opposing the Bill, the House is of opinion that the only satisfactory way to provide social services benefits is through  a  comprehensive national system of social **security** where benefits are above the poverty level and tied to an index adjusted at least annually.

* We will get to that point as soon as it is physically possible to do so and then the pensioners will have some kind of **security**.

* If so, (a) when was the section established, (b) how many officers are employed and what are their designations, (c) what is the annual cost involved in maintaining the section, (d) is it proposed to add to the staff employed in the section, (e) to what extent are the officersinvolved in **security** activities and (f) have relations improved with the Post Office unions since the establishment of this industrial Relations Section.

* In sub-clause (4), paragraph (b), omit the words 'be prejudicial to the defence or **security** of Australia or would otherwise' substitute 'for a reason specified in the certificate being a reason referred to in paragraphs 9(3) (a), (b), (c) or (d) 
The amendment circulated by the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  would delete the words 'or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest'.

* It is for that reason that the Government has moved its own amendment which would take out the words 'would be prejudicial to the defence or **security** of Australia or would otherwise' and substitute the words 'for a reason specified in the certificate'.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Again, I would have thought that he would be aware that there have been quite strong **security** requests that the Prime Minister should undertake his travel in such a manner that he does not put at risk other passengers on aircraft on which he travels.

* They can say that **security** does not matter.

* The Prime Minister himself has said: 'It is not my **security** that concerns me.'

* However, I have sighted personally reports from the head of his Department and from the head of another department responsible for Australian **security** firmly putting to him that he should take into account the consequences of his travelling commercially and the risk that inevitably he thereby places on other passengers.

* I am told that the cost of the Prime Minister's suite in New York included not only accommodation for **security** officers but also an office.

* On his visit to New York the Prime Minister met  Mr Strauss,  who is the Special Trade Representative of the United States Government,  Mr Allan  Greenspan, the former  Chairman  of the the 
It put additional funds into the hands of large low income families where the help was most needed, but in a period of inflation when prices and wages are still rising, when taxes are subject to indexation and social **security** pensions are indexed, the relative values of those family allowances declines.

* We believe that .the **security** of a base service will prove an attraction to teachers.

* In essential terms the Commonwealth Teaching Service will be a mechanism to provide continuity of service and **security** for teachers working in schools for which the Commonwealth has responsibility and to facilitate movement between Commonwealth operated school systems.

* In relation to the effects of pension increases for which this Government and I as Minister for Social **Security** have been responsible.

* The outstanding feature of the investigation is the need for irrigation to raise the whole efficiency and **security** of the Bundaberg region sugar industry.

* If we give the central place to the traditional issues of power politics we may be led to forget that the threat to the peace of the world and to the **security** of this country derives much more fundamentally from the gap between the rich nations and the poor, between the developed and the developing nations than it does from the global ambitions of the Soviet Union or the paranoia of China.

* Wittingly or unwittingly they are undermining the confidence of the Australian people, the Australian investor, in the long term **security** of this country.

* The argument that Qantas cannot provide adequate **security** is a specious argument, and false.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Other Australian interests lie closer to home .

* These include: the **security** of our neighbours in South East Asia and the South West Pacific; the **security** of our peacetime and wartime lines of communications through these areas; the **security** of our off-shore resources; the **security** of the ocean areas generally from which direct threats to the **security** of Australia could be brought to bear in the longer term.

* The paper goes on to state that there is a **security** role which Australia is well pleased to accept.

* The paper goes on: 
There is, however, an opportunity for Australia to co-operate in a defence context with its neighbours and its allies in the region to help strengthen their defence capabilities and their sense of **security**.

* Such activity would contribute positively to the **security** of Australia's strategic environs with a selectivity realistically related to our resources.

* -An analysis of the estimates for the Department of Health, the Department of Repatriation and the Department of Social **Security** will prove that the harnessing of modern scientific techniques has resulted in the shifting of economic resources from areas which were considered of great significance some years ago to these 3 vital areas.

* I believe it is absolutely essential in Estimates debates dealing with social **security**, repatriation and health to indicate to the Australian people that this Government is a government of concern for the elderly and the unfortunates in our society.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 30 May 1979: 
1 ) What social **security** benefits are given to Vietnamese refugees on entry into Australia.

* At what time(s) are Vietnamese refugees entitled to the full range of social **security** benefits normally available to Australian citizens.

* Everyone has the right to liberty and **security** of person.

* On behalf  of my  constituents who are so  concerned  about the matter 1 have raised, I ask the Minister and the Government  to  take steps  to  ensure that all migrants permitted  to  come here have housing **security** and employment **security** and  do  not displace Australian workers  or add to  the employment difficulties  of  people already citizens of Australia.

* Stubbs points out in his book that until the Government undertakes a major survey of our social **security** system our poor will continue to live half lives.

* It would be a market for the little man, the person who we really want to get to subscribe to the bonds and who by subscribing would have the **security** of his income for life protected against the erosion of inflation, and the return of capital after death to his estate for the benefit of his children again would be protected from any inflation erosion.

* There would be no difficulty whatsoever in raising $3,000m or $4,000m a year on the Australian market from people who would want to get **security** for life against inflation.

* This new Secretariat will continue the unfinished work of the Income **Security** Review within the scope of its broader responsibilities.

* and (3) As I have already stated in answer to a question without notice from  Senator Grimes  (Senate  Hansard,  4 April 1978, pages 81 1-812), the new Secretariat, like the Income **Security** Review, provides advice to Ministers.

* I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a comment from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in another place in respect of clause 23 which will aid in the interpretation of the effect of clause 23.

* The Department of Education will liaise closely with the Department of Social **Security** in order to prevent the situation arising in which an overpayment of family allowances may occur.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
During the negotiations there wil be a freeze on the establishment of new Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.

* **Security** arrangements may include United Nations forces, special **security** zones, demilitarized zones and early warning stations.

* It envisages a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel to be signed within three months; full Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai phased over no more than three years from the signing of the treaty; the handing over of Israeli airfields in the Sinai to Egyptian civilian control beginning from three to nine months after that signing; the establishment of **security** zones; and the establishment of normal relations between Egypt and Israel on completion of the first major Israeli withdrawal.

* We particularly welcome the agreement by the leaders of Egypt and Israel that the provisions and principles of United Nations **Security** Council Resolution 242 will govern the negotiations for an agreed basis for a peaceful settlement between Israel and its neighbours.

* For our own **security** if for nothing else we cannot accept this concept of population decline.

* Therefore, from the economic point of view as well as from the **security** point of view, it would be better to have an increased population in Australia.

* In the interests of the **security** of Australia, in the interests of the prosperity of Australia and in the interests of increasing the rate of employment in Australia again, let us reinstate a more reasonable migration program.

* This problem occurs also with special features of social **security** and health expenditure.

* I hope that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will soon introduce a special benefit of that nature.

* Has the Minister for Social **Security** had the opportunity of noting various medical and hospital benefit claim forms, for instance of the Hospital Benefits Association and the Grand United Order of Oddfellows, which require a claimant to authorise the hospital and medical authorities to supply any necessary information to the respective funds?

* This was more than an economic policy; it was a commitment to 2 great and enduring ideals- the ideal of individual **security** and the ideal of growing national prosperity and development.

* Your family's **security** and happiness are not important.

* I work in these areas and I know that they are worried about the **security** of their jobs.

* Are honourable members  opposite  helping by some of their statements about the **security** of their jobs?

* What they want is a 3-year wage stability contract as workers have m the United States of America so that they know they have **security** of employment for 3 years.

* There is nothing like a system of job **security**.

* What he wants is production, profit and job **security**.

* He is going to get that, not from those people from over there who seek to destroy industry; he is going to get it from these benches here, as we realise that job **security** and profit making is as important for them as it is for the nation.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
This debate has gone on for quite some time and has been a matter of great interest; but that is not unexpected as this is the very first amendment to be debated.

* There has swirled around this one word argument against the very substance of the legislation and the very existence of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* This Government knows, as did  Mr Chifley  and the Menzies Government before us, that in this area there is a delicate balance between those individual rights and freedoms and the **security** of our nation.

* We know also that at times it presents dilemmas to us - 
I have started by considering whether Australia needs a **security** service such as ASIO was created to provide.

* That leads to a consideration of what is, or should be, the proper place of a domestic **security** service in a liberal democracy like Australia.

* I have had in mind throughout my inquiries that a balance between the rights of individual persons and the preservation of the **security** of Australia as a nation is no simple or easy thing to achieve.

* Much of the criticism of the use of the word 'ultimately ' turned on the fact that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation might mismanage or misuse the authority that is given to it.

* If Australia needs a **security** service- and I shall show that it does- it must be well run.

* We are not debating the State Special Branch of South Australia; we are debating a Bill to give special authority to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* It will be borne in mind if one appreciates the three fundamental elements in the meaning of 'subversion', and that is why the word 'ultimately' is critical to the authority of ASIO to act in the interests of national **security**.

* Apart from the administrative sector which commands an appropriation of $5,502,800, the Department maintains operations in analytical services, providing **security** for Australians in matters as far apart as food purity standards and drug analysis.

* That body, incidentally, commands an appropriation of $34,950,000, which is rather staggering in quantum but which demonstrates again the vastness of our nation and the sophistication of the meteorological services needed to maintain efficient operation of **security** not only for our aviation industry but for all those who are required to have an awareness of the mischief inherent in the elements.

* The mere framework which the Bill proposes to set up will be filled in, as here, with traditions and doctrines which we have inherited, with tendencies which are not expressed and with bonds which though invisible to the legal eye are yet binding and give the people **security**.

* I think that emphasises the point I want to make and which I think has been forgotten, and that is that the provision of medical benefit payments gives a sense of **security** to people who may not have that sense of **security** and who may be prepared to avoid the possibility of becoming pregnant if they have to look after and deal with an unwanted child or face the dangers of an abortion.

* If so, what **security** arrangements exist to protect such a key national communication nerve centre.

* Have **security** arrangements been reviewed following the alleged proposal to attack Sydney's water supply earlier this year.

* They have to contribute a substantial cash **security**.

* I address my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The loan cannot be transferred to another **security**; it is applied only to the **security** on which it was borrowed.

* The most difficult problem is that, whilst the Bill provides for a 5 per cent deposit to be acceptable, a valid second mortgage cannot be registered against the title which would enable a second mortgagee to exercise a power of sale against the **security** in the event of default.

* -Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to co-operate with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  as in this way the time of the House is saved.

* So the Bill we now have before us is nothing but a naked assault by the Minister for Social **Security** on the administration and autonomy of the private health funds of Australia.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has stated in this House that his health scheme has been fully explained and debated.

* It is headed: 'Statement by Chipp- Shadow Minister for Social **Security**' and states that the Liberal Party-Country Party government would disband the Health Insurance Commission if returned to power at an appropriate time.

* This resulted primarily from bureaucratic breakdown that left the Commission cut off from the significant on-going research, statistical and policy analysis, and administrative support from the Department of Social **Security**.

* As my colleague in the Senate, the shadow Minister for Social **Security**, mentioned when he spoke on the Bill in that place, the advisability of allowing officers of any department or any officer of a statutory body to treat the passage of a repealing Bill as a mere formality must be questioned by members on both sides of this House.

* I wish now to raise a few matters related to social **security**.

* I trust that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will give consideration to this matter also with a view to upgrading the point at which pension payments begin to diminish.

* For example the Departments of Immigration, Repatriation and Social **Security** each give assistance in restricted, or largely restricted ways, which deprive the great bulk of the community from the benefit of such services.

* That will have personal consequences to the farmer and his family and will flow through to the whole rural community- the shopkeeper, the supplier of rural machinery, the rate collector from the local municipality, the bank manager giving consideration to realisation of the bank's **security** or considering deferment of payment of interest on the farmer's loan.

* One of the new guidelines for entitlement announced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in May this year stated: 
-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* What I'm saying is that they can't throw a moat around themselves without picking up some of the  tab for the region's peace and **security**', he said.

* If the position is as stated, will he arrange for the Department of Foreign Affairs to advise the New Zealand High Commissioner in Australia that Australia refuses to recognise any validity  in  the claim of the New Zealand Government that any Indian, Fijian, Samoan, Tongan, Cook Islander or Asian- who has been granted New Zealand citizenship has an automatic right to  bs  admitted to Australia in the same way as  a  European New Zealander or  a  Maori New Zealand citizen is automatically admitted if not debarred on health or **security** grounds, or because of a criminal record.

* At least he can endeavour, with some **security** other than the invalid pension, to enjoy the life that is before him despite the suffering caused by his war disabilities.

* The lady said that all of us- I agree with her- as members of parliament have a responsibility to set an example by our behaviour to the law and our services to and requirements in the community, particularly in relation to **security** checks at airports.

* The complaint from this lady was that the honourable member for Brisbane had refused to undergo **security** checks at an airport- this had been witnessed by her neighbour- a scene was created and the staff refused to carry on working unless he went through the **security** check like anybody else.

* Because he acted in the way he did when  Senator Georges  was arrested, I think it is my responsibility - 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Sections of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on **Security** and Co-operation in Europe dealing with the protection of Human rights and with the principle of noninterference in other countries' affairs are set out below.

* That painful dispute involving the most distressing conflict of loyalties and complex judgments about this nation's **security** was continued and ultimately resolved by his great successor John Curtin.

* The Departments of: Labour (Chairman), Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney-General's Education, Environment and Conservation, Health, Housing, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Science, Social **Security**.

* At its initial meeting the Committee decided to set up a smaller Working Group which comprises representatives from the Departments of Labour, Education, Environment and Conservation, Health Housing, Social **Security**, Treasury, Urban and Regional Development and the Bureau of Census and Statistics to draw up a program for formulating a system of social indicators in Australia.

* By that 1 mean properly classified because if the information contained in them was revealed to an unauthorised source it could cause damage to Australia's **security**.

* If it is true that there are such documents and that making use of the information in them could damage Australia; if it is true, as would be normal and right, that officials or secretaries looked at them, ought it not also to be true that those who do look at them should be cleared by **Security** to see not that they are not communists - let us get away from that - or nazis or fascists but whether they are people generally who may wish to do some damage to Australia?

* A normal government ought in the interests of Australia to take care that such information was seen and handled only by those who are thought safe to do so by the **Security** Service.

* As far as I could understand the interjection - because the chamber is rather noisy and it was competing with others - it was that the present Prime Minister trusts his Ministers and therefore does not care to find out - he, the responsible head of a government - whether his Ministers are allowing secret documents to be seen by those who have not been cleared by **Security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The State Offices of the Depanment of Social **Security** in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Hoban have no staff employed on tea-making and distribution as the provision of tea services is the responsibility of the Depanment of Employment and Industrial Relations.

* Another will confer an exemption from Australian tax on compensation and allowances paid under the employment **security** scheme now authorised by the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973.

* It leaves little room for confidence for a licensee who wants some **security** in relation to a licence.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The words used on this occasion refer to some members of the Press and of the Opposition imperilling the **security** of this country.

* Sir, you  will see the similarity of the 2 remarks - this relating to a threat to **security**, that relating to a breach involving classified information.

* The government would have ultimate **security** over the product proved in the ground as well as over the facilities that have been built with the money borrowed, as well as first call on the profitability of the venture; that is, ordinary commercial merchant banking procedures would be followed.

* The concept of collective **security**, therefore, continues to be of vital importance to us.

* Expenditure on social **security** and welfare is next, and then there is health with an increase of $196m or 25 per cent more than was provided in 1972-73, followed by transport and communications.

* What happens is that a death certificate comes into the Department of Social **Security** and a clerk has to sit down and tick off all the particulars, deal with the matter and arrange a date, a much later date as it happens to be, on which that pension is terminated.

* I do not believe that anyone can deny that this extra taxable capacity arises from the very real advantages of **security** and opportunity which the ownership of wealth brings.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on  6  November 1979: 
Does the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation have to obtain permission from him or from any other Minister or Government official before it can (a) check and (b) open and scrutinise the contents of mail.

* In view of the sorts of deprivation that are evident in the more deprived families in the community, we believe that the $12m spent on the scheme last year, which would increase every year, is far better spent on the sorts of benefits that have been brought forward under our social **security** policy to help low income families and to enable them to choose their priorities for nutrition.

* Of all the aspects of government considered in this Parliament, before all else comes the **security** of this country from external threat.

* Adequate defence is the rock on which national **security** stands.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 March 1978: 
Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the program  This Day Tonight  of 30 January 1978 which investigated the non-payment of social **security** benefits; if so, (a) did the Department of Social **Security** staff on that program claim that the Department is grossly understaffed and (b) did the management say they are capable of handling all payments.

* With present staff ceilings, (a) can the Department of Social **Security** meet its commitments and (b) can it do so without exploiting staff willing to do much paid and unpaid overtime.

* The Regional Headquarters of the Department in New South Wales located in the Tower Building, Australia Square comes under the control of the Australia Square management's building **security** services whose stuff arc trained to assist with any evacuations required.

* **Security** House, North Terrace, Adelaide.

* The Minister or his delegate may release the ship from detention if the fine is paid or an acceptable **security** for the fine is received.

* 1 was a member of the Joint Social **Security** Committee of this Parliament for some years.

* Our forebears by energy and drive, suffering and sacrifice, worked to build an Australia in which all could enjoy social and economic **security** in the years ahead.

* If the Government is to achieve the type of society which we want to live in where poverty is abolished and people will be able to live with a reasonable degree of **security** it will have to move at a faster rate than it is moving at the present time.

* Any government, from whichever side of this House it comes, that does not give to these people an equitable pension to enable them to live with a measure of **security** and comfort in this day and age is not fulfilling its national responsibilities.

* We express concern at the raids on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, the Gair affair- all have a familiar ring about them- and avowed centralism.

* With regard to the Rhodesian Information Office in Washington, I understand that it is the United States Administration's firm intention to give effect under United States law to the resolution which it co-sponsored in the **Security** Council on this question.

* Australia is bound by the terms of **Security** Council resolution (No.

* Department of Social **Security** Office, Why alla: Working Conditions  (Question No.

* If the Minister for Social **Security** and the honourable member for Cowper want to carry on a private conversation I suggest that they should leave the House otherwise they should remain silent.

* Throughout Australia officers of the Department of Social **Security**, which is administered by  Mr Hayden,  are engaged in assessing and helping these people.

* The Interdepartmental Committee on structural changes in industry comprised representatives of the Departments of Secondary Industry, Labour, Social **Security**, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Treasury.

* The Committee was set up to advise the Government on the proper measures needed to facilitate desirable structural changes in the Australian economy, particularly in the areas of adjustment assistance, training and relocation, and social **security** and welfare.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Income **Security** Review falls under the responsibility of the Prime Minister- the  Chairman  of the Review is drawn from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

* The Income **Security** Review has presented a number of reports to the Prime Minister; it is not envisaged that these reports will be made public 
1 understand that the Income **Security** Review does not envisage preparing a consolidated final report.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The amendment moved by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is not relevant to the question which I have brought forward.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security**: Does he not have any compassion?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The decision to remove trade unions from the list of recipients of free copies of the  Social **Security** Quarterly  was made by the Australian Government Publishing Service.

* -Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** aware of the situation in South Australia where a magistrate adjourned a number of applications for adoption of Vietnamese children?

* All that the amendment says is that he has the right to ask whether there is a file on a particular person; and once told that a file exists, he is not entitled to have access to any file, dossier or record concerning an individual person unless the Director-General considers it is in the interest of **security** that the Minister should have it.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: ( 1 )-(6) The land in question at Broadmeadows is part of Crown Portion 5, Parish of Will Will Rook, County of Bourke and is Commonwealth Property.

* Tentative arrangements were made some time ago between the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Administrative Services to reserve part of this land for the possible establishment of a Rehabilitation Centre.

* However the Department of Social **Security** is now looking at alternative sites which will be better suited to the needs for rehabilitation services in Victoria and it is unlikely that the Broadmeadows site will be required for this purpose.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What commitments for expenditure in 1976-77 and 1977-78 does the Department of Social **Security** have.

* Has the Minister for Social **Security** noted recent Press reports in Adelaide concerning allegations by the  President  of the Federal Wine and Grape Growers.

* Further, in the Department of Social **Security**, the staff has been increased by more than 23 per cent since this Government came into office.

* Has the Minister for External Affairs noted thai the **Security** Council yesterday condemned the recent Israeli raid into Lebanon without reference to the guerilla activities from the Lebanese side of the border which provoked it, or the apparent disinterest of Lebanon in curbing those guerilla activities?

* Would the Minister agree that the **Security** Council resolution was neither balanced nor helpful in the present Middle East situation?

* will he undertake to convey that view to our Commonwealth partner, Great Britain, which is not only a member of the **Security** Council, and voted for the resolution but also a member of the so-called Big Four' purportedly seeking a fair and just solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict?

* During the pre- Whitlam period it brought prosperity and **security** to thousands of workers.

* If not, can he offer any hope in a tighter labour situation for additional help to the fruit growers in his electorate and mine whose financial **security** is under some degree of threat?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The proposed Moratorium would play a part in undermining Australia's **security** and is a betrayal both of our national interest and of our young men on the battlefield.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1) What sums, and for what purposes, were given to the Wayside Chapel, Kings Cross, N.S.W., by (a) direct grants and (b) section 96 grants administered by the Department of Social **Security** in each of the last 5 financial years.

* The training of the handicapped in rehabilitation centres or sheltered workshops is however the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**.

* People who are in receipt of a pension or benefit from the Department of Social **Security** may be eligible for assistance from these sources.

* There is continuing liaison between my Department and the Department of Social **Security** to minimise overlap in these areas.

* I refer you to the Minister for Social **Security** if you want a more detailed reply on the facilities available through rehabilitation centres and sheltered workshops.

* 1 ) The Government is aware of reports that the offices of the South African Council of Churches and the Christian Institute were raided by the South African **Security** Police on 26 November 1976, that certain documents were confiscated and that several members of both organisations were detained for questioning.

* From this and other information available it is clear that large numbers of opponents of the South African Government's apartheid policies remain in detention under the provisions of a variety of oppressive **security** laws.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* This is a matter of Government policy which will be kept in mind in the continuing review of the social **security** system.

* The documents about which I have spoken come from the files of the AttorneyGeneral's Department, the Commonwealth Police and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* They have all been declassified and no breach of **security** is involved in tabling them.

* With this end in mind, I should like to suggest that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation should maintain some supervision over migrant groups (making no attempt to disguise its surveillance) and bring to your attention any activities which might be considered to have contravened Sections 30  (a)  or 30  (c)  of the Crimes Act.

* Important changes will also be made in our police and **security** arrangements.

* Another problem is that matters of national **security** often involve breaches of State criminal law.

* This has often meant that ASIO has not been supplied with information which bears on matters of national **security**.

* The conclusion the Attorney-General has drawn from this is that we need Federal laws to cover crimes which may affect national **security**.

* The Commissioner of Commonwealth Police,  Mr Davis,  advised the Attorney-General that, frustrated in that ambition by **security** precautions which were taken and were obvious to us all, the terrorists might make an alternative attempt on the life of the Australian Prime Minister or other Ministers of the Government.

* I present the following paper: 
Yesterday the Minister for Social **Security** answered a question regarding the Government's intention to raise the subsidy limits on aged persons homes and hostels.

* The article states later on that he is the husband of the present Minister for Social **Security**- and  Mrs Audrey  Reader and  Mr H.  Murray Hamilton.

* Mr Guilfoyle,  as I said, is the husband of the present Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Guilfoyle.

* All this is admitted by the husband of the present Minister for Social **Security**.

* But, as I have said, the whole crunch of this issue is that there was an agreement between Efftee Broadcasters Pty Ltd and 3XY Pty Ltd, with  Sir Magnus  Cormack as  chairman, Mr Guilfoyle,  the husband of the present Minister for Social **Security** as the executive director and  Mrs Audrey  Reader and  Mr H.  Murray Hamilton as owners.

* The powers in the Swiss Parliament; power to choose the Ministers and a close identity of the Ministers with the House, offer **security** against the emergence of dictators in Papua New Guinea.

* The adjective 'free' is curious when used to describe something which, through the admission of the Minister for Social **Security**, will cost $ 1,408m of taxpayers' money.

* But perhaps the worst example of misleading is in the newspaper advertisment which states: 
My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** and Minister for Repatriation and Compensation.

* 1 ask every person who has and welcomes the right of choice this question: Does he want the GortonM'cEwen Government, a Liberal-Country Party Government, which will play its part in the cause of freedom, or does he want a government formed by the Australian Labor Party which is consciously, determinedly, and persistently assisting our enemies and which is giving aid and comfort to those who are out to destroy freedom and who want a Communist regime to dominate that part of South East Asia that is of importance to us and of vital importance to the **security**, the future and the continued independence not only of Thailand and Cambodia but also, 1 believe in time, of Malaysia, Laos and Singapore.

* There was a problem with respect to the organisation of society for full employment and the accompanying problem of the organisation of society so as to deliver social **security** for those who require and demand that it be delivered.

* But the unstated assumption of all that Beveridge said was that there had to be transfers within society, whether within a health system- of which the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  would be aware- or within a social **security** system.

* One was the provision of an adequate level of social **security** and social services within a country.

* In his latter years, he was concerned with the effects of inflation upon social **security** and old age.

* Let them judge the Senate for its extraordinary and reprehensible lunge for power; taken regardless of national **security** as exemplified by its rejection of this defence Loan Bill; taken without regard to national political stability, without regard to the national economy and without regard to individual welfare either; as exemplified by the salaries which will not be paid to the armed forces, nor to the Public Service; as exemplified by pensions which will not reach pensioners and social welfare payments which will not reach social welfare beneficiaries.

* The statistics relating to Unemployment Benefit recipients are compiled and analysed by the Department of Social **Security**.

* If the claimant refuses an offer of suitable employment this is reported by the Commonwealth Employment Service to the Department of Social **Security** which then determines eligibility for Benefit.

* Beyond voting for that resolution in the General Assembly, we also sought a voice in the **Security** Council and put again our views.

* I would assume that when  Mr Winspeare's  report is tabled by the SecretaryGeneral there will be a further opportunity for Australia to seek a voice in the **Security** Council.

* Who in our society has the most to gain from the initiatives in the field of transport, education, health services, social **security** and other public services which this Government has taken since it came to power?

* In the short time that I have been here I have made 32 representations to the Postmaster-General's Department, 19 to the Department of Repatriation, 44 to the Department of Social **Security**, 35 to the Department of Education and 14 to the Department of Health, as well as many other representations for individual cases that 
The **security** situation in Phuoc Tuy Province has markedly improved.

* It became necessary for the free world to set up organisations for collective **security**.

* SEATO was also born at that time as an organisation of collective **security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Despite the Government's recognition of the vital importance of reducing the completely unacceptable size of the deficit which could have eventuated as a result of Labor policy, it should be noted that in some areas the Government has been sympathetic and understanding in relation to expenditure.

* I refer to the areas of education and social **security** as examples of the Government's understanding.

* In the field of social **security** no changes are to be made to the existing arrangements relating to age pensions and allowances, invalid pensions and sheltered employment allowances.

* Unless we are able to provide for the **security** of Australia then all the other things we are doing will be for nought.

* I ask the Minister for Defence why the Pacific Islands Regiment is still being trained in internal **security** techniques notwithstanding the Minister's own denial of such a role in the future.

* On 6 March 1979  (Hansard,  page 607) the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition asked me, as Minister representing the AttorneyGeneral, a question without notice concerning proceedings in the social **security** conspiracy trial.

* The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Three of the defendants in what has become known as the social **security** frauds matter, to whom legal aid has been granted by the Australian Legal Aid Office, have taken proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales for certain orders in respect of certain rulings made by the Magistrate in the preliminary proceedings.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The details requested are not available for all social **security** pensions and benefits.

* The satellites could play a highly significant part in national defence and **security** as the **security** and flexibility of satellite communication - which can work to a transportable ground station - would make them a significant asset in defence terms.

* It is worthwhile noting that **security** risks are minimised because damage to the ground station affects only the local area since none of them needs to be a vital relay centre.

* There are snared goals, **security**, and maintenance of national independence.

* That is national **security** as far as the Liberal Party is concerned.

* The commissioners should have access to the records of all Federal authorities, including health, social **security**, matrimonial causes and income tax authorities, and should have power to seek the cooperation of the respective State authorities in these jurisdictions, including the State law enforcement and child welfare agencies; as far as practicable, the commissioners should comprise a mother who is experienced in social welfare work, a medical practitioner and a criminologist; and the commissioners should be assisted by senior counsel and have power to sit in camera.

* Yet on 6 May the Minister for Social **Security** announced completely different medical rebate facilities for optometrists.

* Let us not think that the Convention gives us any more **security** than it does.

* It is, indeed, no different to the Government appointing judges, the Government appointing chairmen, for example, of repatriation appeal tribunals or appointing chairmen of social **security** appeal tribunals or appointing presidents and  deputy  presidents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* That concept, with **security** of tenure for career officials, has always been subject to provisions in the Public Service Act relating to termination of employment of surplus officers, retirement on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or incompetence and dismissal on disciplinary grounds.

* Social **Security** seen a statement alleged to have been made by the Canadian Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare and used by the Australian Medical Association, the General Practitioners Society and professional letter writers employed by Messrs Turner and Cade of the hospitals contribution fund and medical benefits funds who quoted the Canadian Deputy Minister as saying: 
Has the Minister for Social **Security** had any checks made on that statement and can he tell us whether in fact that quotation referred to the whole of the Canadian health system?

* The Australian Government is committed to the promotion of **security**, stability and economic development in the Asian region.

* We therefore have welcomed United States' assurances that the withdrawals will be carefully phased and carried out in a way which will maintain the military balance and preserve **security** on the Korean peninsula and North East Asia.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable members question: 
Briefly, the procedure would be that people wishing to claim unemployment benefit should be required to register with the CES.

* As a matter of preference, the Review would not wish to have the CES issue, receive or check Department of Social **Security** benefit claim forms, but recognises that the CES ought, as a community service, have the necessary forms available.

* The claim form would be endorsed by the CES to the effect that the person was registered for employment and passed to the Department of Social **Security**.

* Thereafter the CES would take no pan in the benefit procedure except to inform the Department of Social **Security** that the person was no longer registered or to report on unsatisfactory attitudes to employment .

* The ratio between those at work and those receiving social **security** payments plays an important part, of course, in this debate.

* Let me now turn to the social priorities of the young, in particular of the young married couple seeking the **security** of a home.

* Speaking in Brisbane on 22nd January 1968 he said: 
In reply to your telegram of 1 8 September 1 978 I wish to confirm that it is the Corporation's intention to close the Narrabundah sub-branch on 29 September 1978 because there are **security** problems with the premises.

* 9m could cover **security** problems in an area which has many pensioners and poor people.

* We do  not  believe there is any **security** in isolation.

* Yes, in a report in the Canberra Times' this morning of a question I asked of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in this House yesterday.

* The report states: 
The increase in pharmacy charges for making up prescriptions was granted to the pharmaceutical profession without any demur at all, the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  told  Mr Staley  .

* Is the Minister for Social **Security** able to confirm that, under the previous Government, debt collecting agencies and other business undertakings of the sort represented in this Parliament by the parties now in Opposition were given access to the confidential files of social **security** beneficiaries?

* I remember a Press release put out by  Senator Wheeldon  when he was Minister for Social **Security** in which he said that 28 per cent of those receiving unemployment benefit were not entitled to that benefit.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  wrote to the States some months ago to get their acceptance of the implementation of these proposals.

* I now wish to refer to the position in South Australia about which  Dr Deeble,  the special adviser to the Minister for Social **Security** has been writing to  Dr Cowling,  the head of the Australian Medical Association in South Australia.

* These letters have been written on notepaper of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The honourable member for Hotham in a significant statement 2 days ago, which was not reported, made reference to the Health Insurance Commission in which at the present time thousands of people are being employed in addition to the Department of Social **Security** at a cost of some millions of dollars to the taxpayers of this country- we say unnecessary cost.

* He said: 
The Liberal-Country Party Government would disband the Health Insurance Commission, if returned to power at an appropriate time,  Mr Don  Chipp, Shadow Minister for Social **Security**, said today.

* Mr Ekimenko was addressing a Liberal Party meeting on Australia's attitude to Soviet proposals for collective **security** arrangements in Asia.

* If that is so, the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Hughes)  should sack the Aus tralian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and every man in it.

* In view of the unprecedented nature of the visits on 16th March by the Commonwealth Police to Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation premises will the Prime Minister assure the House that the visits of the Commonwealth Police will not be extended to other Government departments?

* The absence of a feeling of **security** is one of the main reasons why so many migrants return to the country of their birth.

* In the meantime, until there is a settlement, the obligations of the sanctions provisions that have been laid down by the **Security** Council remain.

* The attitude to entry into Australia of persons with Rhodesian passports remains in accordance with the restraints that flow from our obligations through the **Security** Council sanctions provisions.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
The honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  has already raised some questions tonight relating to telephone tapping by private individuals and State bodies.

* My purpose in entering the debate on these estimates at this point is to put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  who represents the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood)  in this place some additional questions concerning telephone tapping, this time by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation - that is, by a body operating under the authority of the Commonwealth.

* Essentially the legislation establishes that ASIO may tap telephone conversations only upon a warrant of authority from the Attorney-General himself and that the Attorney-General must previously have been satisfied by the Director-General of **Security** that the issue of such a warrant was justified on the grounds of national **security**.

* That, however, is probably part of the price we have to pay for a telephone system that works, but at least the Post Office employee does not have the same vested interest in random sampling of selected persons' conversations which an over-zealous or over-officious member of the **Security** Organisation might have.

* Attorney-General and in the Post Office and, indeed, in the **Security** Organisation itself, that we should have not merely an assurance but an absolute guarantee from the Attorney-General that the new mechanics of telephone tapping adopted by ASIO will not operate to subvert the authority reposed in him by the Telephonic Communications (Interceptions) Act.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Have the procedures concerning **security** checks and clearances been changed since December 1972?

* Is the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation still responsible for **security** checks or are they carried out by the Commonwealth Police?

* I have referred to those pieces of legislation which Labor brought down during its short term of office because they must make it clear that as far as the Labor Party is concerned the wool industry, which is one of our most important industries, should again have organised marketing facilities at its disposal of a kind which will give it the **security** it deserves.

* I would like to think that the proposal that we have before us at present will give him that **security**.

* I would be very happy if I was able to stand here and be quite certain that the wool grower would receive from this Bill the **security** that we would like him to receive.

* Nations **Security** Council.

* In January 1974, the South Vietnamese Government, in a letter to the  President  of the **Security** Council, requested that the Council consider the dispute between China and South Vietnamese Government, in a letter to the discussions involving all members of the Council, including Australia, were held, the South Vietnamese Government withdrew its request.

* No person was arrested by either the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation or the Commonwealth Police.

* Additionally, there were 30 other policemen performing specific duties such as motor cycle escorts, personal motorcade duty, traffic point duty and manning observation posts or engaged in the **security** of buildings.

* 1 ) As specified in chapter 3 of the Protective **Security** Handbook issued in June 1 978.

* An advisory council on intergovernmental relations and a joint Federal and Northern Territory Legislative Assembly committee will be set up; a task force has been established to make recommendations on Australian Capital Territory reserve powers; a review has been established on the income **security** system as a whole; committee has been established to investigate the possibility of expanding the area of choice in services available to the disadvantaged; a Medibank review committee has been established; a tertiary education commission is proposed; a committee has been established to investigate how to run and re-establish the cadet corps on the cheap; a Defence Council has been established and an investigation has been set up to examine the completion of  HMAS Stirling  in Cockburn Sound.

* It is not surprising that he finished up by saying: 
I should like to refer to what I consider to be one of the main issues facing this government or any other government in the field of social **security**.

* He said: 
I think that when one deals with policy questions in the field of social **security** one has to pay tribute to the Department of Social **Security** and also, to my mind, to the Social Welfare Commission which was set up by the previous Government.

* I listened with some care to what the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said about the situation, that if the $1.50 did not turn out to be enough the Government would consider increasing the .

* There are 2 changes which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has made clear.

* Firstly, he has relaxed certain of the safeguards in the Department of Social **Security** and has changed the administration in that regard.

* The omission of this matter -seems to me to be evidence of a lack of some sense of proportion in dealing with social service and social **security** matters.

* Like all previous speakers in this debate, I lend my support to the innovations contained in the Bill introduced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I just want to tell the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that in the eyes of the Australian people vituperation and vilification are not the hallmarks of a fighter.

* I draw the attention of the House to the proposition that the care of our elderly, our orphans, our unfortunates, the people who are deserted, should never descend to the type of social **security** benefit where it is part and parcel of the set-up that people are treated as card players and are merely dealt a hand.

* It ill behoves us as members of society to expect a government forever to be giving total health and social **security** care.

* If we are to retain our dignity as a nation it is absolutely essential that there be a place in our social **security** structure for people to exercise charity.

* I can confirm that there was a practice of many years standing tolerated by the former Government and governments previous to it which allowed widespread access to information contained in the personal files of clients of the Department of Social **Security**.

* In fact, I have been acquainted of one case in which a police officer, estranged from his wife, was constantly tracking her down by using information from the endowment files of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I have already had listed various agencies - the list covers several pages - which have been able to obtain information on one basis or another from the Department of Social **Security**.

* I do assure the members of this House who are genuinely concerned about the longstanding breach of the confidentiality of information supplied to the Department of Social **Security** on trust by members of the public, that I will take steps to preserve people's rights and that this will be done in an effective way.

* However, a government must look at the situation in the light of information provided by those who are responsible for giving to the Government advice about the **security** of this nation against external aggression.

* It is the practice of this Government, as it has been of all previous governments, not to give information about specific aspects of **security**.

* A comprehensive inquiry is being conducted by a very competent commissioner,  Mr Justice  Hope, into the **security** operations of Australian **security** organisations.

* It is expected that that inquiry will cover all aspects, including any possible operations of Australian **security** organisations outside Australia.

* We will co-operate in expediting those provisions because the pensioners, the unemployed and so many others with no economic **security** are the ones who are bearing the suffering, the misery and the need which has stemmed from the unconcern and neglect of the Prime Minister who, not so long ago, was promising them Utopia.

* Our sorry  record  in Australia is that more than 300 000 Australians have lost their jobs, their **security**, their aspirations and their ambitions .

* The Income **Security** Review provided advice to Ministers within its terms of reference and having regard to Government policies.

* 1 ) Two surveys have been carried out by the Department of Veterans' Affairs since 1975, one of which was a joint project with the Depanment of Social **Security**.

* An Arm Amputee Survey was conducted jointly with the Department of Social **Security** in 1975.

* Perhaps more to the point, something is amiss if it is impossible to reach a close degree of liaison between Commonwealth Employment Service offices and the Department of Social **Security** when a person's subsistence is at stake.

* The unemployed people have got to be stopped from being passed from one department to another- from the CES offices to the Department of Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security** upon notice: 
-The subject of this debate, like the subject of so many other debates, is one upon which great judgments can be made as to the stands taken by the various political parties in Australia.

* Of course, no one can seriously suggest that since Federation the parties to which honourable members opposite belong, irrespective of what they have called themselves, have given the depth of thought to the people in receipt of social **security** payments or social welfare payments that the Australian Labor Party has given.

* The Australian Labor Government has raised all pensions and social **security** payments.

* At the same time the Government is improving the whole social **security** program in other fundamental ways.

* We do not believe that social **security** comes from cash benefits alone.

* The first is to the effect that annual reports about the operation of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation ought to be presented to the Parliament.

* We propose that there should be a better definition of **security** and subversion.

* We propose that no person should be denied notification of the existence of an adverse **security** assessment.

* Lastly, we propose to restrict the circumstances involving the safety of a **security** officer and the offence of disclosing an officer's identity.

* In fact, we recognise the need for new legislation to govern the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* However, the Opposition believes that the legislation should be withdrawn and redrafted because of significant omissions and because it fails to provide a basis for the establishment of a bipartisan **security** service.

* By refusing the reasonable request of the Opposition, it seems to me that the Government has deliberately preferred a partisan approach to **security** matters.

* In the United States there has been increasing scrutiny of **security** organisations and federal police forces.

* Then, of course, there are those in the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**- the Hope Report.

* If all the other so-called **security** organisations operating in Australia take the powers vested by the legislation as a blueprint for their activity, there will be a serious curbing of legitimate political activity in this country.

* As  Mr Justice  Hope warned: 
A **security** organisation must be careful to avoid mistaking mere dissent or non-conformity for subversion.

* concerning a particular individual would ... be justified by reason of its relevance to **security**'; he can do so 'on the question whether a communication of intelligence  .

* would be for a purpose relevant to **security**'; and he can do so on the question of determining 'the nature of the advice that should be given by the Organisation to a Minister, Department or authority of the Commonwealth'.

* In the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**,  Mr Justice  Hope found that in the final analysis Ministers are the ones for whom intelligence advice is produced.

* No longer is any such relationship sacrosanct if the director of **security** has the idea that one party to any of those relationships ought to be suspected.

* The 1979 Budget gives ASIO $ 14.2m, and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Service $8.3m.

* -Well, at any time the alternative Prime Minister of this country is not even to be consulted or informed on **security** matters, or to be given the opportunity to express an opinion on future appointments to the position of Director-General of ASIO.

* He was talking about the present Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* It is unfortunate for the rural industries of Australia that the Minister for Northern Development is politically dead and his erstwhile colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**, has obviously much greater influence in the Cabinet than he has.

* Another thing that the Leader of the Opposition has underestimated in recent times is the determination of the Australian people to make a contribution where subversion by Communist powers could possibly threaten our future **security**.

* 1 ) notes that the organs of the United Nations, particularly the **Security** Council, charged with the responsibility of maintaining peace, have failed to fulfil that function and that one of the reasons for this is that the structure is representative of Governments and not people; 
resolves to repeal the unanimity rule of the **Security** Council which allows a single nation to thwart the wishes of the rest of mankind and replace it with a more democratic procedure; 
The honourable member for Capricornia will say that that is supportive of his proposition that Aboriginals should not have to pay taxation on royalties they receive.

* and the need for cither Federal or State bureaucracies to provide health and education, social **security** and other services.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that a grant of $5,900 has been made by the Minister for Social **Security** under the Australian Assistance Plan to the South-West Sydney Regional Social Development Council for a centre for mothers supporting a child or children.

* If so, did the Minister for Social **Security** seek his advice on this project before approving it because of the extensive involvement that the Department of Manufacturing Industry has in this type of area; if so, when.

* I have read carefully the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and have noted that it is his desire and the Government's belief that residents of aged persons homes should be allowed to elect representatives to the boards of management of their homes.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has also stated that he is disappointed with the response to the Aged Persons Homes Act by local government bodies.

* We affirm that there should be no discrimination based on race, colour, sex, descent or national or ethnic origin in the acquisition or exercise of the right to vote, in the field of civil rights or access to citizenship, or in the economic, social or cultural fields, particularly education, health, employment, occupation, housing, social **security** and cultural life.

* We affirm that there should be no discrimination based on race, colour, sex, descent or national or ethnic origin in the acquisition or exercise of the right to vote, in the field of civil rights or access to citizenship, or in the economic, social or cultural fields, particularly education, health, employment, occupation, housing, social **security** and cultural life.

* 1 ) What proportion of the income of a married person receiving average weekly earnings with a spouse and two children is total tax and social **security** payments.

* What proportion of the income of a married person earning two and a half dmes average earnings with a spouse and two children is total tax and social **security** payments.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that a project has been approved by the Minister for Social **Security** under the Australian Assistance Plan for Youthsay research into community needs of youth conducted by the South West Sydney Youth Workers and Leaders.

* If so, did the Minister for Social **Security** seek his advice before approving the project to ensure that it conformed with the activities his Department is pursuing in this area; if so, when, and what was his response; if not, why not.

* The long-term (20 year) **security** offered in the cash and conversion loan in October 1973 carried an 8i per cent interest rate compared with the 7 per cent rate offered on the comparable long-term **security** issued in the previous loan in July 1973.

* Items: Voluntary Insurance; Social **Security**; Repatriation; Sick Leave; Superannuation.

* What the Fraser Government has sought to do is reverse the historic consensus of a generation of Australian politics, the principle adhered to by successive Labor and Liberal governments, ever since the Second World War that the prime responsibility for social welfare and **security**, and for all reforms and initiatives in this field, rests with the Federal Government.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 12 October 1977: 
Does the Department of Social **Security** yet have available the percentage increases made in (a) workers ' compensation and (b) third party insurance since the report presented on 26 September 1975 by the working party of officials on the financial aspects of the National Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme  (Hansard,  9 December 1976, page 3738 ).

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Pamphlets have been produced in major migrant/ refugee languages describing the various services provided by the Department of Social **Security** and these have been distributed widely through the migrant information network as well as other existing outlets commonly used by migrants and refugees.

* 1) for the International Social **Security** Association.

* It was suggested that in the Department of Social **Security** in 1977-78 debits were raised to record overpayments of benefits, pensions and allowances totalling $ 19.8m- well above the corresponding figure in the previous year.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: 
Does the Department of Social **Security** plan to publish an updated version of the Directory National Groups in Australia.

* I quoted for the first time from the report by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representative at the interdepartmental meeting on 2nd March.

* On that extract I made this comment: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Honourable A. E. Adermann, M.P.- Minister for the Northern Territory; the Honourable A.

* In the Budget Speech the Treasurer proudly said that since coming to office the Government had taken a great stride forward in the field of social **security** and welfare and that now it must take stock of its progress and consolidate its gains.

* Social **Security** being able to co-operate and make such a scheme workable.

* -The Director-General of **Security** and I both realise that it is quite improper and it is unprecedented to reveal and to publicise **security** documents or conversations concerning **security**.

* Were school funding the responsibility of the Department of Social **Security** this would free the Department of Education to concentrate on formally educational and pedagogical issues and services.

* While no specific date has been set for the termination of occupancies of the remaining buildings at Riverside the tenants other than Commonwealth occupants can be given no assurance of **security** of tenure for any future period.

* Children are the victims of irreversible injustice if they are deprived of parents, love, **security**, discipline and the opportunity to be children.

* Since the Malaysian Government is now using Butterworth as a base for operations against dissident forces in the Malaysian-Thai border area, does he see any risk of Australia becoming involved in an internal Malaysian **security** situation.

* Is he satisfied with the arrangements made by the Malaysian armed forces for the physical **security** of the base against incursions or attack by dissidents.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: 
How many (a) motor cars and station wagons by make and tare, (b) trucks and other commercial vehicles by make and mass and (c) motor cycles by make, are operated by the Department of Social **Security** and statutory authorities and business undertakings under the Minister's control.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The latest statistics of pensioners in electoral divisions, by type of pension, compiled by the Department of Social **Security** are in respect ofthe position at 30 June 1976.

* The level of income of many of these people has now dropped beyond the level of unemployment benefits which is now provided by the Department of Social **Security** these days.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
An announcement has been made of the Government's new program for funding accommodation for the aged.

* A detailed statement was issued by the Minister for Social **Security** on 20 May 1976.

* The officers of the Department of Social **Security** and of the Commonwealth Employment Service also deserve considerable credit for their understanding of the situation and the fact that they were able to operate within the changes made to various parts of the welfare legislation, which for the first time enabled selfemployed persons to benefit in times of stress from the social welfare system.

* We seek for all Australians the same oportunities to share in that destiny and to live their lives with the highest measure of material **security** and well-being and with the highest measure of intellectual and spiritual fulfilment.

* They include: Legislative Record of the Year; Reports Tabled in Parliament on Inquiries Instituted by the Present Government; Statements Arising from Meetings Between Australian Government and State Government Ministers; Committees; Commissions of Inquiry and Task Forces Reporting to the Government; Reports Tabled by the Present Government on Inquiries Instituted by Previous Governments and the record on Cities, Women, Social **Security**, Resources, Other Decisions, Migrants, Rural Industries, the Economy, Education, the Environment and a Text of Treaties and so on presented to the Parliament.

* They were concerned in broad terms with measures to increase food production in the developing countries; to improve world food **security**; to raise nutritional standards; and to enhance the reliability of supply and the suitability of food aid.

* Resolutions XVI and XVII call respectively for the establishment by FAO of a Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture and for adherence by governments to the FAO International Undertaking on World Food **Security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
and (2) Statistics of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries cross classified simultaneously by sex, marital status and birthplace are not available.

* However, statistics of unemployment beneficiaries cross classified by sex and birthplace are available from the quarterly surveys of unemployment benefit recipients conducted by the Depanment of Social **Security**.

* In the electorate of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  attempts have been made to get regional employment projects under way, but unemployed people prefer unemployment benefits to work under the RED program.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The numbers of (a) dependent children and (b) students eligible for pensioner health benefits are not available separately.

* These numbers relate only to dependants of social **security** pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries.

* In a changing world employees become concerned about their job **security**, which is very important to them.

* There has certainly to be a realisation that there must be better staffing and more members of the Grants Commission while we are operating under the Grants Commission structure, and that a lot of thought should be given to ways of guaranteeing the financial **security** and the ability of local councils to plan and to get involved in longer range programs rather than councils having to rely on piecemeal handouts from the Government under a multitude of different programs.

* United States complains about leaks in Canberra The United States has complained to Australia about a lack of diplomatic **security** in Canberra.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 1 September 1978: 
In view of the intention to erect Commonwealth Offices at Port Augusta, SA, will the Department of Social **Security** establish an office in the building to enable it to service the north and north-west of the State.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answers to the honourable member's question: 
The Department of Social **Security** is unable to confirm the number of unemployment benefits cancelled for the reasons stated as it does not record terminations of unemployment benefit by occupation of the recipient or type of job refused.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
1 ) With respect to pensions and benefits paid under the Reciprocal Agreement on Social **Security** between Australia and the United Kingdom, are any supplementary or topping-up benefits paid by the Commonwealth to persons eligible for United Kingdom benefits who are resident in Australia.

* Let us look at what the Minister for Social **Security**, the  Hon.

* She said: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Treasurer will be aware that bankers have stated that what is known as the Minsec affair has restricted bank credit for sound propositions and that at least one of the trading banks is a creditor of Mineral Securities Ltd.

* In the light of Government powers restricting bank lending, how is it possible for a trading bank to advance sums of the magnitude of several million dollars without effective **security**?

* -If one were to approach this clause in another way, could any member of the Government say: 'If we were in fact to accept the amendment so that the words 'likely ultimately' were omitted from the Bill, would we seriously jeopardise the functions and the activities of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation?'.

* The point is that we should not give our **security** intelligence forces responsibilities for legal interpretations which by their very nature must involve some subjective analysis as to whether there has been force, or whether the actions in question, are an essential part of the political fabric of the particular organisation which is under scrutiny, and use of that force is part of the ongoing methods that they regard as both legitimate and proper.

* Use of the term 'likely ultimately' means that a whole range of very normal political activities and citizens who are involved in normal political activities can be encompassed in that definition and because of that can be the subject of a **security** dossier.

* I believe that the omission of this particular clause would not neuter the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, lt would give that organisation a very legitimate and proper charter.

* There is no compelling reason for parliamentarians having to balance the rights of the ordinary Australian citizen and the rights of a **security** intelligence organisation or to make any presumption in favour of that organisation as against the rights of the 
Another provision of the Bill is that the allocation of research funds to the CSIRO will be determined by the Minister for Primary Industry in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science.

* This is to be applauded because not only does it give **security** of tenure to the employers in both organisations but it also gives them greater freedom.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
What major programs were funded by the Department of Social **Security** in the Electoral Divisions of (a) St George, (b) Banks, (c) Barton and (d) Lang during 1976-77, including recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The following table shows the estimated number of persons aged 65 to 70 years qualified by residence, at 31 December 1977, who were not in receipt of a Social **Security** pension: 65 years........... 40,700 66 years........... 33,800 67 years........... 24,700 68 years........... 21,200 69 years........... 20,000 70 years........ negligible 
Bank finance is not available because of the overall Australian liquidity situation in which business and farmers throughout Australia will be short of thousands of millions of dollars of liquidity throughout the next 8, 10 to 12 months.

* These funds are lent on the **security** of the clip.

* Australia accepts and abides by the resolutions of the United Nations **Security** Council which impose sanctions against the illegal regime in Rhodesia.

* What **security** forces are available for the protection of Butterworth Air Base, its Australian Air Force personnel and Australia's $60m investment in aircraft at the base?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
and (2) I refer the honourable member to the information provided in answer to question number 1090, page 3163 of  Hansard  of 8 November 1977.

* This information is the latest available as statistics on programs administered by the Department of Social **Security** by electoral divisions are not routinely kept.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The guidelines governing the exercise of the Departmental discretions in the administration of the laws governing the functions of the Department of Social **Security** are presently being reviewed to enable the Department to comply with the provisions of the Freedom of Information legislation when it becomes law.

* Are any **security** restrictions placed on the candidate in the village area.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The guidelines governing the exercise of the Departmental discretions in the administration of the laws governing the functions of the Department of Social **Security** are presently being reviewed to enable the Department to comply with the provisions of the Freedom of information legislation when it becomes law.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
At 20 March 1978 an estimated 1,346,400 Social **Security** pensioners were holders of pensioner health benefit cards.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 May 1978: 
1 ) What major programs are being funded by the Department of Social **Security** in the Electoral Division of St George during 1977-78, including current and non-current expenditure, and what is the expenditure on each program.

* The appropriation for the Department of Health has been increased from approximately $70m to $99m, for the Department of Housing from $130m to $160m, for the Department of Social **Security** from $89m to $141m, for the Department of Transport from $242m to $260m and for the Department of Urban and Regional Development from $llm to $14m.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 10 October 1978: 
1 ) Since the loss of its Migrant Services Section, what steps has the Department of Social **Security** taken to ensure equal access of non-English speakers to the services and advice they require.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 27 March 1979: 
1 ) Is it a fact that the Department of Social **Security** has appointed Ansett Airlines as official travel consultant to the International Year of the Child National Conference on the Child, the Family and the Community.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: 
1 ) What is the total volume of fuel consumed per annum by motor vehicles operated by the Department of Social **Security** and statutory authorities and business undertakings under the Minister's control.

* They want to know whether they will continue to have **security** of employment and whether their sons are going to be conscripted if by any mischance the Opposition were re-elected into government.

* We have heard discussions about a meeting that is supposed to have taken place a couple of weeks ago between  Dr Deeble,  an adviser to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  and certain representatives of health care connected, I think, with the private hospitals.

* The people are to be asked to consider whether or not the Minister for Social **Security** was prepared to meet representatives of a private hospital at a meeting in Melbourne.

* The Minister for Social **Security** on many occasions has been to public forums and explained his policy.

* It is certainly extraordinary that there should be criticism of the Government's proposal in which there would be complete guaranteed **security** under the highly scrupulous methods which have been advocated for maintaining confidentiality of patients' records.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Bill is aimed at promoting the Government's objective of ensuring the best possible educational standards for all Australian children, whether they attend government or nongovernment schools.

* Surely there is no better **security** than a government backed loan.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I would like to make a brief comment.

* I would not agree with the amendment moved by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* In fact, one might say that it is the last motion he will ever move as Minister for Social **Security**.

* The hide of him to stand in this House this afternoon and talk about the workers of Australia and his concern for their **security**, and to talk about the young families in Australia when all this Government is prepared to do for young families in regard to such an item as child minding centres is to offer them as much as it is prepared to offer the farmers to pull out trees which a few years ago it encouraged them to plant.

* We must never ignore from now on the welfare and **security** of the South Pacific, to which area the Minister for Foreign Affairs very properly devoted a large part of his statement.

* With this clear objective and on the firm foundation of schemes introduced by previous Liberal-Country Party Governments we have already made great advances in providing **security** against the cost of illness.

* That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and otherlack of livelihood in circumtsances beyond his control.'

* I know that my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**, also was interested in raising this matter.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Information is not available in the form requested.

* However, Table 1 below shows the number of primary producers granted unemployment benefit during the period 10 May 1976 to 2 September 1977, classified by Social **Security** regional office.

* If a person's pension has been affected by property in the past the Department of Social **Security** will reassess entitlement under the new income test.

* Pensioners who receive age, invalid or widows pensions or supporting mothers benefits from the Department of Social **Security** will not pay tax if they have no other income.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 27 October 1977: 
1 ) How many lone fathers are there in (a) each State, (b) the Northern Territory and (c) the Australian Capital Territory, and how many of them are in receipt of social **security** pensions.

* It has produced a climate in the Pacific in which political, social and economic advancement (including ideals of justice and democracy) has been able to take place undisturbed and unhindered by pre-occupations with **security** problems.

* I suppose that on any day when the United Nations is in full session with all the committees, the six standing committees and the special political committee meeting, and perhaps the **Security** Council and the General Assembly in pleniary session, there would be approximately 2,000 people meeting.

* However, when we come to the **Security** Council, that is no longer a functional body for peace.

* I sat in on a **Security** Council meeting at which it was discussing the invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnam.

* The **Security** Council cannot operate in this way.

* These cannot get off the ground while one of the five permanent members of the **Security** Council resists it.

* If we consider the situation in southern Africa, the **Security** Council members who are principally charged with the responsibility of producing and protecting and expanding world peace are the countries that are the biggest arms sellers.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Prime Minister announced in this House on 2 June 1976 that the Government would not proclaim the Children's Commission Act.

* The Prime Minister announced at that time that the Government was creating an office of Child Care within the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The Minister for Social **Security** advised the Senate of the amounts provided by each State on 19 September 1978  (Hansard,  page 72 1 ).

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The approved Leasing Program for 1978-79 for the Department of Social **Security** includes provision for additional accommodation to relieve the situation in the Whyalla Regional Office.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 26 September 1979: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* 1 ) The answer to this question is not known; the most common group of persons whose unemployment benefits are cancelled have returned to work and there is no way of identifying the cases in which the Department of Social **Security** would have been advised of the return to work if the visit had not been made.

* I direct a question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Mainly, it is the Department of Social **Security** which makes the inspection and determination through its investigating officers.

* Honourable members will recall that last October the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  ordered a major survey of recipients of relief.

* The truth is that the unemployed are helpless and unorganised, and at the mercy of the bureaucrats of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Does the Minister for Social **Security** really believe that such excesses will create one single extra job in Australia?

* Why not continue to pay benefits and reimburse the Department of Social **Security** from the NEAT scheme if necessary so that there is no disincentive to these young people as a result of the changeover.

* Fourthly, pay the unemployment benefit to persons whose benefit has been cancelled but who have appealed to the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal and are waiting for the appeal to be considered.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 26 May 1978.

* 1 ) What has been the cost of maternity leave in the Department of Social **Security** during the years (a) 1976 and (b) 1977, and (c) in the period January 1978 to date.

* There's another aspect-that of our national **security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The British Department of Health and Social **Security** recently decided that the payment of its National Insurance pensions in Australia should be made by order direct from its United Kingdom Central Office in the same way as its pensions are paid in all other countries.

* These changed arrangements were the result of initiatives by the United Kingdom authorities and were not sought by the Australian Department of Social **Security**.

* It is the intention of the Government to make absolutely certain that anyone who is in receipt of social **security** benefits receives them because they are due to him and not because he is infringing the regulations in any way.

* The Department of Social **Security** carries out work tests and makes checks on the people who are receiving unemployment benefits.

* It is the Government's intention to review continuously the payment of social **security** benefits to make certain that they are paid only to people who are entitled to receive them.

* 1 ) Did he, or any of his colleagues, acting on behalf of the Liberal-National Country Parties, issue a statement on the economy on 27 November 1975 which,  inter alia,  said that consideration will be given to the introduction of a new **security**, on a limited basis, with an inflation adjusted capital value or floating interest rate.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
See answer to ( 1 ).

* The numbers of pensioners in each class at 30 June 1976 is shown at page 1 16 of the Annual Report of the Director-General, Department of Social **Security**, for 1975-76. 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 October 1977: 
Has the Department of Social **Security** undertaken any studies of the New Zealand system of national superannuation; if so, is the investigation complete and will details be released.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 October 1977: 
1) How many pre-schools within the electoral divisions of St George, Lang and Banks are funded by the Department of Social **Security** 
As with everything else, this Government is determined to do too little too late.

* Two years ago, when it was already clear that **security** of oil supply would be critical, I asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government would take action to diversify future sources of imported crude oil for Australia.

* His pious reply in September was as follows: 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What is the approximate weekly cost per person for the administration of (a) the Pensioner Section of the Department of Social **Security** and (b) all other fringe benefits available to pensioners from the Commonwealth or Commonwealth Statutory Commissions.

* It aims as well to remind the House of some of the perils which will arise if any Australian Government should flout our commitments or jeopardise confidence in our word or our endurance, or seek refuge from contemporary burdens by reducing the country's defence capabilities and retreating from a military role in helping to maintain the **security** of the external environment in which Australia is destined for all time to live.

* Formulae may fail to reflect adequately the potential range of **security** problems imposed on Australia in the years ahead and the various responses which future parliaments will want to be able to choose from.

* There is a recognition that two friendly neighbouring countries sharing common interests in regional **security** should, in those fields where it is within their capacities, pursue and cultivate practical co-operation with one another.

* States will, as pledged to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon since the Nixon Doctrine was promulgated, provide the foundation of Australian **security** against threats or actual attack going beyond Australian capacity to deal with alone.

* What seems evident from the diplomacy exercised by all these powers over recent months is that there is a new fluidity in which new relations may be formed, and if old **security** dangers recede some new ones will take their place.

* But it is, I believe, an essential ingredient of Australian diplomacy that Australia should be understood to be a country whose **security** interests are growing; whose population and wealth are growing; and whose determination to take some part in shaping the environment in which we live is more lively than ever now that the great western powers have served notice that their involvement in lesser situations is not to be taken for granted.

* 1 have not the slightest doubt that the United States commitments to Australia under the ANZUS Treaty are as strong and effective as ever and it is my belief that it is the responsible attitude of this Australian Government towards the eco nomic growth and the military **security** of this region that have contributed to maintaining this undeviating attitude.

* What can be achieved by a defence programme giving us the ability to project Australian armed strength beyond our continental shores is twofold: It will give future governments options to have some influence on events in our strategic environment so that we may contribute to the greater **security** of all countries in that area.

* It is also a practical fact that where insurgent violence is evidently nourished and supported from beyond the frontiers of the affected country then the interests of all neighbouring countries are more or less affected by the resultant threat to **security**.

* It does not consider that this increase in Soviet influence would tend to an improvement of Australian **security** in time of war or to the pursuit of more independent foreign policies by Indian Ocean states in times of tension.

* Our action in this regard has been warmly welcomed by our allies as a positive contribution to global **security**.

* China's military power is of growing rather than lessening importance in Australian **security**.

* But Chinese military capability is a factor which cannot be ignored in considering Australian **security**.

* Our hope is that Papua New Guinea will advance in **security** and stability through the pre-independence period and through all the years which follow independence.

* We must, however, recognise the contingency that in some way or in some measure the future **security** of that country might be threatened.

* Greater self-reliance will also enable us to co-operate more effectively in **security** matters with our neighbours, who are disposed to look to Australia for co-operation and assistance while they are developing their own forces.

* It is in no sense in conflict with our expectations of assistance, under ANZUS, if a major threat to our **security** should arise.

* The Navy and the Air Force are concerned with the preservation of the **security** of our general maritime environment and with freedom of navigation.

* Before I conclude I return - to one matter of overriding importance to the **security** of Australia and many other countries.

* These are serious matters for the future **security** of smaller countries like Australia.

* As the vote is on a personal and individual basis I put it to honourable members that they have a great responsibility for the future happiness and **security** of large numbers of people and families who can only benefit if the Family Law Bill is carried.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has not mentioned what effect this plan will have on the capital expenditure for the necessary expansion of hospitals.

* The Country Party carried out, as did the Liberal Party, a very deep and comprehensive study of what was being advocated by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The fact that a levy is paid does not mean a social **security** card will be automatically issued.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) and (2) Statistics sought by the honourable members are not maintained.

* The only category of social **security** benefit for which separate statistics are maintained in respect of refugees is special benefit, and then only in respect of South Vietnamese, Cambodian or Timorese children for whom special benefits are being paid.

* I should like to read from a document sent from the Department of Social **Security** last year to a superannuitant to demonstrate that in this case $30 a fortnight was to be ripped off this superannuitant by the new, generous Hayden Budget, presented by the same gentleman who objected so violently about a benefit of $40 being removed once in a lifetime.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) and (2) The latest information readily available on the distribution of pensioners, by type of pension, in electoral divisions of the Commonwealth is contained in the publication 'Social **Security** Pensioners in Postcode Districts and Electoral Divisions, 30 June 1976'.

* Is it considered that any significant armed attack would be likely to involve substantial internal **security** operations.

* Would Australia's assistance in repelling such armed attack be contrary to the principle of non-involvement in internal **security** operations declared by successive Australian Governments.

* Some statistics were introduced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  this afternoon when he introduced the Bill to increase pension rates.

* If this computer is to run the health system, heaven help the patients, because recently the computers in the Department of Social **Security** broke down and thousands of pensioners did not receive their cheques, files were lost and computer print-outs told people that their pensions had been reduced or stopped.

* That is the sort of thing that is happening at the present time in the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** should come out in the open and correct such inaccurate reports.

* Pursuant to section 9 of the Social **Security** Act 1947 1 present the annual report of the DirectorGeneral of Social **Security** for the year ended 30 June 1978.

* Will he consult with the Minister for Social **Security** to have the waiting period for unemployment benefits waived for those persons to be retrenched, and will he give an undertaking to other Aboriginal communities throughout 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* I wish to raise tonight the exaggerated and rather hysterical response to **security** in which all honourable members, attendants, aides and workers in the Parliament are now entangled.

* I do not deny that some **security** arrangements are probably necessary for this Parliament.

* What I query is the rushed, hurried and sudden imposition on the Parliament of a set of **security** arrangements for which no clear arguments have ever been adduced, whose nuisance value might well outweigh any positive virtues and which appear unlikely to deter anyone with malign intentions towards any member or members of this House.

* My first objection is to the sudden method of the implementation of these **security** arrangements, virtually by overnight edict from the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the 
Undoubtedly, barriers have been created between members of this Parliament and the public.

* Moreover, I think it is fairly doubtful that the infringements will yield any effective **security** in this warren of a building.

* I think that, if we are really concerned with **security**, the act;on we should take is straight away is to begin to build a new Parliament House, conceived in terms of the needs of the late twentieth century.

* I am diverging from the Address-in-Reply debate, but I should like to speak about a number of social **security** matters, and the honourable member's interjection was most appropriate.

* Let us consider the obsession of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party with **security**.

* One wonders what their definition of **security** is, because so far they have not given it.

* To them is a person a **security** risk only because at some time he might have been a communist or even had membership, say, of a youth organisation such as the Eureka Youth League or might have had some association along the line with someone who has what is commonly termed pinkish tendencies, or do the League of Rights or the National Civic Council or any of these organisations which are popular with some of the other members opposite come into the picture?

* What is the criteria of honourable members opposite for **security**?

* In many ways we believe that the **security** of Cabinet and Government information is tied up with ministerial responsibility.

* It is for the Minister to decide and be responsible for the safety and **security** of confidential information in his hands.

* Did the present Prime Minister, when Leader of the Opposition, receive any briefing on defence, foreign affairs and other matters, or was he considered a **security** risk?

* So perhaps the Opposition should think about what it means by **security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 25 October 1978: 
1 ) What is the total number of child-care facilities within Australia for which the Department of Social **Security** has financial responsibility.

* We do not hear about the **security** organisations in communist countries.

* If one goes on from that definition as to what is subversion- because it relates to **security**- and then looks at where **security** comes into the functions of the organisation one sees that Clause 1 7 states: 
To obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to **security**; 
-The word certainly should not be removed.

* He suggested that it evidenced some paranoia on my part in relation to **security**.

* But the fact of the matter is that in terms of this debate people simply want to know, and want our **security** organisation to know, what is going on in organisations that are subversive.

* We are defining subversive so the community will know what these organisations are about and what we believe constitutes subversion so that these organisations can be monitored and our community and our Government will be informed through the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation being able to do that.

* The decline in family standards of disposable income, **security**, food, housing and living quality since December 1975.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The Department of Social **Security** conducts regular computer surveys of pensioners and beneficiaries.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
The value of Social **Security** cheques which are returned to the Department and cheques which remain lost and therefore become stale is repaid to the Commonwealth Public Account.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 1 October 1978: 
How many persons in receipt of social **security** fringe benefits became ineligible for those benefits following cost of living rises to the rates of social **security** benefits and the Government's failure to index the fringe benefits means test level during (a) 1975-76,(b) 1976-77 and (c) 1977-78. 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) How many appeals have been lodged with the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal in each State and Territory against departmental decisions (a) to terminate unemployment benefit payments and (b) not to pay unemployment benefit.

* As the Prime Minister has said, sound relations with Indonesia are fundamental to the **security** of the nation.

* He also mentioned in some detail the situation of welfare workers and social workers in relation to grants administered by the Department of Social **Security**.

* However, if he reads the statement made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on Budget night he will see that agreement in principle has now been obtained for welfare workers to be employed under this scheme.

* In the national interest however, the right must be retained to raise a national service force should the **security** of Australia be threatened.

* In other words the Labor Party does not reject national service if ' the **security** of 
As I said before, I accept the Minister's explanation.

* But I do suggest to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  that the memory of the Minister for the Navy is obviously so faulty that it is dangerous to the **security** of this country to leave the responsibility for the administration of our great Australian Navy in his hands any longer.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has made one of his rare confessions of being restrained.

* But the Minister for Social **Security** would know that, human fallibility being what it is, there is always a bad apple.

* Only recently, 2 
Finally, I address the Minister in his capacity representing the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in this chamber.

* Also, could the Minister for Social **Security** provide the House with information as to the sorts of tests that are in force in New Zealand- means test, income tests et cetera- in regard to the eligibility of age pensioners?

* I assert that this country must spend what is reasonably necessary as a bare minimum to provide for the **security** of the nation.

* It states: 
The first responsibility of government is to provide the nation with **security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: 
Has the Department of Social **Security** received further submissions from the Victorian Council for Handicapped Readers regarding the Copyright Act to provide for the reproduction of literature and dramatic works for the blind and disabled without infringing the copyright of works so copied.

* He will have noted my question a week ago to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs about the report that was made last July by a working party consisting of officers from that Minister's Department, his own Department, and the Departments of Social **Security** and Education, appointed to study the problems of Aboriginal employment, including the impact of unemployment benefit payments on Aboriginal communities.

* Very good housing was supplied at cheap rentals; health services were either paid for or actually provided; and perhaps the greatest benefit of the lot was job **security** through lifetime employment.

* It is not shown in the official figures as yet but there is hidden unemployment in large corporations with lifetime employment, where many workers are under-employed and the company in essence provides the social **security** supports that we expect from our Government.

* I want to look particularly today in speaking to the Social Welfare Commission (Repeal) Bill at the role of the Commission and its association with government and also its association with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* The Social Welfare Commission was directly responsible to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* If one looks at the reasons for the abolition of the Commission I think they can be pin-pointed to two main areas: Firstly, the Minister for Social **Security** may have found the Social Welfare Commission dysfunctional and duplicating work done by the Minister's department, and may have found its reports contributing little to the area of social welfare.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 24 November 1978: 
1 ) Does the Department of Social **Security** or any agency under the Minister's control prepare an index  of Hansard.

* Minister for Social **Security** will not address the House until I call him.

* The Minister for Social **Security** should not take that type of point of order again.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on6 September 1977: 
1 ) What ( a ) is the annual cost of and ( b ) staff is involved in the (i) production and (ii) distribution of the publication  Social **Security** Quarterly.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The estimated number of Social **Security** pensioners who were holders of pensioner health benefit cards at the dates requested were: 
Again, I will not dwell on the petty social **security** measures of the Budget, which the Press of this country has pretty thoroughly amplified; but let me suggest how the inaction of recent years has further disadvantaged the disadvantaged.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following response to the honourable member's question: 
and (3) The matters canvassed in these parts of the question do not come within the responsibility of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* -Last night, when the debate on the Budget was interrupted, I was drawing attention to the great threat which the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  represented to Australia's social **security** system and in fact to the whole range of services which governments normally provide.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 21 August 1979: 
1 ) Who is the Director of the International Year of the Child Unit in the Department of Social **Security**.

* A question which has very wide ramifications for civil liberties is that of **security**.

* It is necessary to realise that apart from questions of espionage, the **security** services ought to be concerned only with political activities which do not follow normal democratic processes.

* The past activities of our **security** services are objectionable and disturbing on two scores.

* Firstly, by defining subversion as any activity judged to be on the left of the political spectrum and determined by unsound and irrational criteria the **security** services have been guilty of objectionable interference with the civil liberties of people who are not a threat to **security**.

* He states: 
I found a mass of material having no connection whatsoever with genuine **security** risks.

* Let me make it clear what I am talking about in relation to **security**.

* Nobody approves of that but people are included in the records of **security** agents because they are, say, Australian Labor Party parliamentarians or judges of the Supreme Court.

* If one looks at the Hope report's summary of the situation made by the British, particularly by Lord Denning, one sees that it raises a question of **security** being the fourth arm of defence.

* It is for those reasons that we are very critical of the suggestion that **security** will be maintained because of the activities that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has been able to encourage through special branches.

* Of course we need an adequate **security** service.

* On the contrary, if our **security** services had concerned themselves more with matters of real **security** in the past this incident might have been avoided.

* The **security** advice that cleared the Hilton Hotel as being suitable for such a high risk conference is certainly questionable.

* The issue had been created, and he is not at all sure that in the future this sort of conference should be held in an area where no proper **security** can be provided.

* Of course, **security** did not exist.

* If the land has no sale value, what **security** in terms of capital value has he or his community?

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Was this subject one which was being considered by the Income **Security** Review Group, and was it the subject of a recommendation in the interim report of that group.

* As the Prime Minister and his Government have given a new respect to the Australian position in the world- a new authority for our countryand as we currently have a seat on the United Nations **Security** Council, will the Prime Minister please outline to the House the action that Australia is taking and will take to improve this tragic situation?

* The arrangements for the loan are to be subject to the approval of the Treasurer and adequate **security** will be provided to the Commonwealth while any amounts of principal or interest remain unpaid.

* Mr Michael Delaney, my Private Secretary, was informed at his office at 4.10 p.m. by telephone by his wife, who had been informed by a junior and unidentified officer of the registry in the Department of Social **Security**, who in turn was reputed to have heard it in the cafeteria in the building in which the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs and Social **Security** are housed.

* Approvals for periods of 17 weeks, even up to 26 weeks, are too short to allow project officers to really get their projects mounted with any degree of **security** at all.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 23 May 1979: 
If so, under which social **security** benefit will they be categorised and when will this come into effect.

* Here, with all the freedoms that are afforded debate in this place, we can look for **security** against some of the difficulties and the dangers that I have mentioned.

* The Government's approach does an injustice to the true meaning of the word 'protectionist' for the Government is guilty of doing precious little to effectively protect the **security** of jobs.

* We talk about 'pro-change' because we express optimism that change, if managed properly, and in the interests of all, offers the surest path to the achievement of job **security** for Australian workers associated with an everincreasing standard of living.

* It failed to take initiatives, when it should have done so, not for the sake of the experience of a Prime Minister but for national **security**.

* The Government has been most hawkish in the Indian Ocean, suggesting that there is likely to be penetration by overseas foreign influences which could well jeopardise our **security**.

* The littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean, at their forthcoming meeting, should, inter alia, reach agreement on measures, such as a commitment to settle outstanding disputes by peaceful means, the renunciation of nuclear weapons and the maintenance of a reasonable military balance among themselves, in order to promote conditions of **security** within the Indian Ocean region.

* Instead of seeing the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  speaking on this matter, whom did we see?

* What has he ever had to do with social **security** which ever benefited anybody?

* The article which 1 shall quote appears in the 'Australian **Security** Analysts Journal'.

* I do not quite know what that journal represents, but it must serve a fairly limited field of people who are called **security** ana lysts.

* He wrote: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The Department of Social **Security** has no record of any such cases.

* (a) Postmaster-General's, Services and Property, Social **Security** 
Labor and Immigration, Postmaster-General's, Services and Property, Social **Security** 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
How many constituents of the Electoral Division of Batman are recipients of social **security** payments.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following table in answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Committee has presented a report on what safeguards ought to be adopted to protect the individual's privacy under the proposed Health Insurance Program.

* The next task of the Committee will be to examine the question of access to personal information recorded by the Department of Social **Security** and what measures are necessary to protect individual privacy in these circumstances.

* The **Security** and General Reinsurance Company Limited 
The **Security** and General Reinsurance Company 
asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Are illegal migrants entitled to claim social **security** benefits pending their apprehension; if not, is there any reason to believe that the benefits are being paid to illegal migrants.

* Because they are statements that are made continually, particularly by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  I think I should take them up at this stage and say something about them.

* One has only .to look at the Department of Social **Security** itself to realise the inefficiency that creeps into large scale Government operations.

* How many pensioners can go to the Department of Social **Security** and talk to anyone sensibly about .their file?

* I rise to speak in the debate on the estimates of the Department of Social **Security** in relation to the important matter of the Australian health insurance program.

* The Government's proposals, as outlined in the White Paper presented to Parliament toy the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  have been endorsed by this popular mandate.

* The honourable member and his unknow cohorts have, as far as he has been able to ascertain, made no submissions to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* If it is not, I challenge the Opposition's spokesman on health and social **security** and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  to repudiate this document on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia or be equally responsible for the lies it spreads.

* Those areas referred to the whole of the social infrastructurethe need to build up education, health services, urban and regional development, welfare housing, social **security** and welfare.

* I can never understand why under repatriation measures we refer to a percentage of the minimum rate whereas, when it comes to social **security** matters, we talk of a percentage of average male earnings.

* If so, can he say whether they have come in the belief that their social **security** rights earned in  Germany  can be transferred to Australia.

* Will he obtain the text of the Social **Security** Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Dominion of Canada from either the German Embassy or the Canadian High Commission.

* This country's **security** has never been greatly threatened nor is our **security** seriously threatened now.

* He seems as uncomfortable in matters of **security** as he notoriously is in matters of economics.

* He was referring to **security** matters, both foreign and those affecting our national interest.

* Then we come to another matter that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned today- the cable from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I think it is another act of gross indiscretion on **security** matters on the part of the Leader of the Opposition.

* The essence of dealing with foreign agents is **security**.

* I find it very ominous that so many people should seek to destroy this important bulwark of our national **security** and safety.

* If the Leader of the Opposition were serious about improving our **security** he could take a couple of very simple steps- and take them soon.

* In my view one of the most alarming events of recent times has been the number of documents of a high **security** nature, which are supposedly in the hands of very few people, which nave been appearing in newspapers.

* **security** of this country and its international reputation that is the first leak he should plug.

* They have **security** of employment at a time when approximately 250 000 people are out of work.

* The Minister for Social **Security**, in an undated statement headed 'Emergency Telephone Interpreter Services in Australia', said that she was most anxious to look at ways and means of improving the efficiency of the service and client help.

* My own view is that if the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had in fact ruled that the last increase in wages under indexation should have been only 3 per cent, 3.2 per cent or whatever figure it picked on, I am sure that this Government would have introduced legislation limiting the increase in social **security** benefits to the same percentage.

* It is relevant to the cost of living for social **security** payment recipients and it is therefore relevant to the importance of these increases to them.

* We have a Government which slashes spending on health, social **security**, housing, urban and regional development, transport and even assistance to industry, yet it still manages to increase the deficit by $800m between January last year and January this year.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: 
1 ) How long does a person who entered the country without an entry permit have to remain in Australia before he or she is entitled to social **security** benefits.

* How many of the Vietnamese who entered Australia without permits are now receiving (a) sickness, (b) unemployment or (c) any other social **security** benefit.

* 1 ) Has the Priorities Review Staff had kindergartens referred to it for report with particular reference to any conflicts between the Department of Education and the Departments of Health and Social **Security**.

* foreign students who because of their political activities in Australia fear for their personal **security** upon returning to their home country be granted permanent residence in Australia.

* Pensioners who receive an age, invalid or widow 's pension or supporting mother's benefit from the Department of Social **Security** will not pay tax if they have no other income.

* It is important to note that Pensioners who are liable to pay taxation are able to make arrangements with the Department of Social **Security** to have taxation instalments deducted fortnightly if they would prefer this to paying a lump sum at the end of the financial year.

* We do not wish to neglect it but, in a sense, Australia is the front line of the area and future recognisable threats to the **security** of Australia can be expected to come from the west and north-west, and not from the east - that is, from the east of Australia.

* For this reason, I am anxious to draw the attention of the Government urgently to the Australian Territory of Cocos Islands which, I believe, is at least equally important to the **security** of Australia and to our trade routes as are Darwin, Learmonth or Cockburn Sound.

* With the co-operation of the other friendly countries that I have mentioned, Australia can make a worthwhile contribution to the **security** of this area as well as to its own **security**.

* The **security** of the whole of South East Asia would be reinforced against a nuclear China if Australia and her allies possessed a similar capacity operating from Cocos Island.

* That was true whether it was Aboriginal affairs, social **security**, small business or whatever.

* The Departments of Social **Security** and Employment and Industrial Relations have classified him as being unemployable.

* The Director-General of Social Services and, regrettably, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  have not been prepared to accept the findings of that appeal.

* There is clear evidence that two departments, the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, have agreed that in their view this man is unemployable and on that description have said that that is going to be the way they classify him.

* I am asking the Minister for Social **Security** to look again at this case.

* One of the departments under discussion is the Department of Social **Security**.

* We talk of a social **security** allocation in the Budget of a little more than 20 per cent.

* I simply say to the Government- I do not want to get into the detail of a lot of the estimates- that if it wants to see the Department of Social **Security** make the sort of contribution that it ought to be able to make to the Australian community the Government should get the economy of this country soundly based.

* Therefore if one wants to have a social **security** program that is desirable, if one wants to have the money provided in the Estimates really producing results, one should seek to have full employment with a stable economy.

* People want to have social **security** but they also want to have the satisfaction of contributing themselves.

* We do not want to get to a stage where we have massive increases in social **security** because we have a system in which people are unable to develop thrift, to save and to plan for their own future.

* I would hope the Government would turn its mind not so much to being proud of increasing its Budget from $ 10,000m to $ 12,000m and this year from 
S 12,000m to $ 16,000m, claiming it is doing a job because it has increased the social **security** budget by $ 1 ,000m.

* Clause 48 of this Bill deprives the family of **security** and permanence because it provides that one party to a marriage can, for whatever reason he or she thinks fit, terminate the marriage on 12 months notice.

* He has a greater sense of **security** because he works and has that income-earning capacity.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 29 August 1979: 
1 ) In 1975 did  Mr Sellwood  of the Department of Social **Security** visit Malta to negotiate an agreement; if so, what were his terms of reference.

* 1 ) What progress is being made with the establishment of the maximum **security** offshore animal quarantine station on Cocos Island.

* I would like to answer 2 points on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Firstly it is important to realise that spending this year on social **security** as a whole has increased by 38.3 per cent.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The guidelines governing the exercise of the Departmental discretions in the administration of the laws governing the functions of the Department of Social **Security** are presently being reviewed to enable the Department to comply with the provisions of the Freedom of Information legislation when it becomes law.

* Townsville perhaps has benefited more than most other areas in that regard because Townsville has become a significant regional centre for Commonwealth departments dealing with taxation, employment, social **security** and other responsibilities.

* -Unlike the **security** area dealt with in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill which is highly subjective, highly emotive and liable to the grossest errors of self-deception, the drug area is a very real problem in which there are identifiable victims, measurable harm done and a quantifiable amount of social loss.

* We welcome the legislation now before the House, but we welcome it only after a period of time has elapsed during which this imaginative scheme was nearly strangled by the failure of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to exercise his administrative authority to lift certain limits, which I will describe in a moment, to realistic levels.

* He talked about abolition of the age limit making the benefit available to all persons who qualified according to criteria established by the Department of Social **Security**.

* If one looks at the report of the Director of Social **Security** one finds that a number of residents in hostels who receive this benefit has risen to only 54 per cent.

* They need plenty of space and they need privacy, comfort, **security** and the services that go with housing.

* We are not dealing with the deserving poor; we are dealing with ordinary Australians who are entitled to a decent home, with proper **security** and an opportunity to purchase it when they so desire.

* I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a table which has been prepared by the Department of Social **Security**.

* A survey conducted by the Department of Social **Security** in December 1978 revealed that 74.7 per cent of all beneficiaries had no dependants.

* I remind the Prime Minister that in his policy speech before the last election he described the areas of schools, health and social **security** as 'the only fields where meaningful cutbacks can be made'.

* Is a public servant's membership of (a) a Communist Party, (b) the Nazi Party or (c) the National Civic Council relevant to the **security** assessment of that person.

* These new provisions are designed specifically to protect the job **security**, safety, health or welfare of Australian men and women and their families.

* The Grants Commission has been of very great benefit to my own State, so much so that Queensland, together with other Liberal and Country Party States are the leading States in the Commonwealth in terms of economic development, surety of employment, surety of conditions and **security** for their own people.

* To the hundreds of thousands of aged and older people in Australia for whom financial **security** is becoming increasingly more illusory, to whom salary and wage adjustments and indexation are not applicable, for whom inflation is aggravating the stresses and disabilities of the ageing process itself, your early Budget speech observation held some promise.

* It gave **security** to a group of employees who had never previously experienced it - **security** of employment which, in spite of the sad story told by the honourable member for Wakefield, has indeed brought about a considerable era of industrial peace which had not existed previously.

* Surely the situation is at a critical stage when a senior Minister - the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  - No.

* Then there was the Minister for Social **Security**.

* On 7 May the Prime Minister, in a written Press statement, said: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) On 5 November 1 976I held discussions in Melbourne with members of the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunals and Departmental officers.

* Taking into account voluntary insurance, social **security**, repatriation, sick leave and superannuation, my Government's scheme would save taxes, premiums and other exactions totalling between $325m and $375m this financial year.

* The people will be only too ready to believe that a government which does nothing on electoral laws or **security** legislation has something to hide.

* Such picayune savings are meant to prepare us for the onslaught to come against basic and wide-ranging parts of Labor's program- against Medibank, against free tertiary and technical education and expanded programs for education generally, against all Labor's measures for the cities and growth centres, for the protection of the environment, for Aboriginal lands, for social **security**.

* I should like to address my remarks to the proposed appropriation for the Department of Social **Security**.

* Prior to the previous Federal election the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  outlined the policy in respect of social welfare in the community.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) What increases were made in the various social **security** benefits paid in the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.

* Quite clearly, that will have to carve into areas such as social **security** payments or benefits of some type or other.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: 
1 ) What programs have been supported by funds provided by the Department of Social **Security** in the electoral division of Diamond Valley, including recurrent and nonrecurrent expenditure during the years 1975-76 and 1976- 77.

* The policy speech promised 'a bare level of **security** below which no one can involuntarily fall'; nothing has been done.

* Every government program for the people's welfare and **security**, every State and federal and local initiative for better cities, health care, transport and community advancement will be starved and strangled.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 20 October 1977: 
Has the Department of Social **Security** instituted a policy of exchanging senior personnel for a limited period with those of similar status and standard in the private sector or State government departments; if not, why not.

* The computer processing systems should embody the basic **security** features specified in Section F of this report.

* In the short time available to me I would like to deal quickly with social **security**.

* I have spoken of the Government's generosity in the social **security** area.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 25 May 1977: 
1 ) What are the guidelines set down by the Department to enable private persons to be warrantees for persons receiving pensions from the Department of Social **Security**.

* For how many persons receiving Social **Security** pensions do  Dr Noel  Hall and  Mrs Noel  Hall of 129 Windemere Road, Ascot, Queensland, act as warrantees.

* For how many persons receiving Social **Security** pensions does  Mr Bashir  Mohammed Deen of 246 Randall Road, Wynnum West, Queensland, act as warrantee.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Is it a fact, as reported in the Melbourne  Age  of 4 June 1975, that a team of 200 Department of Social **Security** field officers have caught about 50 dole cheats throughout Australia in the last year.

* Mr Stewart: The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* There are about 200 field officers' positions in the Department of Social **Security** establishment, but not all of these were engaged during the past year in work connected with review of unemployment benefit payments.

* He said absolutely nothing about the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill.

* I was saying before the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Holding)  spuriously called for that quorum- I am grateful that he brought an audience into the House- that all honourable members in this place should read with very great interest the  Hansard  record of the speech just made by the honourable member for 
I think that all thinking Australians would take the view that a **security** organisation is vital in Australia.

* They must be identified and, where necessary, they must be eliminated for the **security** of the Australian people.

* I think that all thinking Australians would believe in that and would agree that we must have a **security** organisation of that type to protect the interests of innocent Australians.

* It is true that in arriving at a **security** organisation to protect the people we have to keep in mind that such an organisation needs to have wide powers of surveillance and wide powers in relation to other mechanisms involved with the disclosure of information in order that we can keep proper account of terrorist type organisations.

* But we must also protect innocent individuals in the community against unnecessary actions taken by such a **security** organisation in the name of protecting the **security** of Australia.

* In fact, that was spelt out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  when he said: 
The legislative reforms themselves are so fundamental and wide ranging that a completely new Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill rather than amendment to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act I9S6 has been drafted.

* If the provisions of the present Bill go too far or the interpretations are ill-defined, again there will be a reaction in the community that could well result not in the **security** situation being solved but rather in the creation of instability in the community.

* It is true that the former Government initiated moves to set up a royal commission to investigate what is necessary for a **security** organisation and what changes are required.

* If the **security** organisation is to work and is to be accepted by the community, there needs to be an opportunity for individuals and groups in the community to express their views, not on the way in which ASIO has worked in the past, but on the provisions of this BUI.

* In other words, the Government has accepted that in certain circumstances ASIO or **security** organisations should not be required to comply with existing laws in Australia.

* If we try to do that, I believe that we wil create a **security** situation that does not exist at the moment.

* I have no idea whether the people of Australia are prepared to accept a **security** organisation that does not comply with existing laws.

* A further major consideration is the creation in Pan IV of the Bill of a totally new statutory framework for the preparation and communication of ASIO **security** assessments in  respect of individuals and the giving to most persons affected by prejudicial **security** assessments of a right of appeal to a tribunal presided over by a judge.

* A declaration that the defendants may not lawfully require of their respective members, by reasons of the determination of  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Ian Shepherd, made on 21 November 1974, that the said members pay contributions in excess of those determined by the Minister for Social **Security** on 28 July, 1 974.

* their servants and agents be restrained from counselling or procuring any person to pay contributions within the meaning of the National Health Act 1953-1974 to the defendants in excess of those determined by the Minister for Social **Security** on 28 July 1974 and of accepting contributions in excess of the same.

* Civic exchange has been the subject of a **security** survey and the recommendations of that survey are being implemented.

* This action will provide a standard of **security** appropriate to the status of the building and its equipment in the national telecommunications network.

* I can assure the honourable member that Telecom Australia is conscious of the continuing need for **security** of the telecommunications network, and that **security** is a matter given continual review.

* The outcome of these operations up to 2 March 1979 was that 4027 fruit and vegetable picking vacancies were filled and 1 79 persons were reported to the Department of Social **Security** as having failed the work test by declining to accept this work.

* The decision to permit 5 members of the Rhodesian Girls Brigade to transit Australia en route to New Zealand without an overnight stay was taken in November 1972 in accordance with policy relating to U.N. **Security** Council Resolutions concerning travel of Rhodesians.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* 1 ) The contract price for printing the  Social **Security** Quarterly  in 1977-78 is $13,092.

* The production and distribution of the  Quarterly  is undertaken as part of the overall responsibilities of the Department of Social **Security** in respect of a whole range of leaflets, booklets and other information covering the activities of the Department.

* 1 ) Has an assessment been made of **security** arrangements at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, Western Australia; if so, who made the assessment.

* Are the current **security** arrangements considered adequate.

* Is his Department acting to improve the **security** arrangements by the employment of extra staff.

* Where they have no income as a result of this disaster they are entitled to social **security** payments, but those payments last for only a few weeks.

* Nevertheless they have some income and are thus prevented from receiving any social **security** payments or assistance.

* The collapse of Associated Securities Ltd is evidence of the failure of the Government to introduce national companies and **security** legislation.

* Developments in Iran continue to generate anxiety regarding oil supplies and about the **security** of the north-west Indian Ocean area.

* In Korea, new assessments of the north's military strength have placed this at a significantly higher level than had previously been estimated, and concern over **security** in the Korean Peninsula has led to adoption of a longer time scale for United States ground troop withdrawals from the Republic of Korea.

* By concluding them the Philippines has made a major contribution to the stability and **security** of that region.

* Does the Minister consider the electronics industry vital to the development and **security** of Australia as a high technology nation?

* What are the implications of a successful 
The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  quoted a.  Dr Jonson  at length.

* This means a greater return on investment, which is to the benefit of shareholders and provides greater **security** to creditors.

* If there is to be a prize for deviousness in this exercise it must go to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  because he is pursuing a policy of denigrating the private health funds.

* I quote a letter from the Department of Social **Security** dated 18 June and signed by  Mr W.  G. Armstrong, Assistant Director-General and delegate of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* On 18 June the New South Wales health funds received a preliminary circular from the Department of Social **Security** on this matter.

* Woodward, O.B.E., as head of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The Government has previously announced its decision to proceed with this appointment and the passage of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill is necessary in order that the appointment may proceed.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill will ensure that the appointment of a judge as Director-General of **Security** does not affect his tenure of office as a judge, or the salary, allowances and other rights and privileges that he has by virtue of his judicial office.

* The **security** and integrity of Australia are of prime concern to our Government, and this point was amply demonstrated yesterday in the Governor-General's speech which stated that the Government's foreign policy will reflect a greater self-reliance and willingness to develop friendly and co-operative relations with all countries.

* If it were not for the 300 000-odd American troops in Europe one would have to doubt the will and the fortitude of some of the nations of Europe to pull together to look after their own collective **security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Under the reciprocal agreement on social **security** between Australia and New Zealand, people from New Zealand are deemed to be permanently resident in Australia after they have been here for six months.

* More important than that, having led with this sort of palpable political nonsense, the  Speaker-  a man who is supposed to be above the politics of this place- then enjoins the community to accept the argument that because of the incidents that took place at the Hilton Hotel we as a community ought to accept the fact that the **security** service of this nation- the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation- is entitled 'to gather intelligence knowledge about any person who may become a threat'.

* I have pointed out to the  Speaker  of this House my concern about the fact that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisationthis is clearly the case from the evidence collected by  Mr Acting  Justice White- regarded every member of the Australian Labor Party in every parliament of this nation as a potential threat and had collected dossiers on them.

* I am bound to say that some real progress might have been made in apprehending the culprits in respect of the Hilton Hotel outrage if our **security** organisations had been doing their job instead of acting as professional snoopers on people who are concerned to express their rights as citizens in the community and take political positions and attitudes which do not necessarily agree with those of the government of the day or the people who adopt the standards that apply in ASIO.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: 
Unfortunately, although all the leaders of the world admit that this is the ideal answer, when the acid is put on them and they are asked: 'Why do you not teach your people this?

* If there were disagreement in the United Nations General Assembly or **Security** Council, a threequarters majority could be required.

* Shall I speak of defence and refer to the sickening humiliation suffered by each of our armed Services all because a group of fanatics compelled by a dedication to foreign ideologies wants to throw into jeopardy the safety and **security** of our people?

* Shall I refer to the disgusting raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation which struck a fatal blow at our status and our integrity - an integrity built on an impeccable system  of  intelligence and **security**?

* I have spoken about our economy and our quality of life, but all of this is of little consequence if we do not have the capacity at least to provide a realistic base on which our defence can be quickly mobilised and the **security** and protection of our people assured.

* The Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  is responsible for $633m; the Minister for Defence  (Mr Morrison)  for $l,800m; the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  for $ 1,908m; the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  for $2,778m; and at the top of the list is the Minister for Social **Security** and Minister for Repatriation and Compensation  (Senator Wheeldon)  who is responsible for $4,772m.

* They were: The Minister for Labor and Immigration,  Mr Cameron;  the Treasurer,  Dr Cairns;  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Mr Uren;  the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden;  the Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Senator James  McClelland; the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Stewart;  and the Minister for Environment,  Dr Cass.

* They are: The Minister for Labor and Immigration,  Senator James  McClelland; the Treasurer,  Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Mr Uren;  the Minister for Social **Security** and Minister for Repatriation and Compensation,  Senator Wheeldon;  the Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Mr Bowen;  the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Stewart;  and the Minister for Environment,  Mr Berinson.

* Quite often we find many distressing cases of extreme personal hardship and anxiety when people do not have sufficient funds left over from their social **security** payments to do such simple things as repairing a broken window or door.

* The former  Chairman  of the Commission,  Dr Sidney  Sax, has taken control of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat which is to coordinate and absorb most of the functions of the Commission and its relationship to the Department of Social **Security**.

* If this country is not defended and if there is no **security**, all the other shining goals are impossible of achievement.

* And excellent **security** for it.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The information sought by the honourable member is not available to the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Department of Social **Security**'s responsibility for capital assistance for accommodation of aged people does not extend to all of the areas implied in parts 1 and 2 of this question.

* The objective of this, of course, is to give to the inmates of any aged persons home the maximum sense of **security** for their future.

* For instance, the expenditure on social **security** and welfare in Australia increased by only 14 per cent during the same time.

* Higher wages, social **security**, tariffs, subsidies, tax benefits - an amazing array has been built up in Australia during this time.

* The West German model organises a mass of descriptive material into a coherent picture of the organisation of the armed foces within the framework of the **security** of the Federal Republic.

* The Swedish Ministry of Defence breaks the subject into a number of compartments analysing national **security** policy, the execution process planning, goalsetting procedures, programming and budgeting techniques.

* These arguments for SEATO do not counter the criticism that it is useless as a vehicle for assuring **security**.

* The paper stresses that the Philippines and Thailand are members, and their **security** is of major strategic significance in the region as a whole.

* If the **security** of these major Asian nations were threatened they would face a very grim pospect if SEATO were their only prop.

* On the evidence of previous conferences, this Parliament building will rival the Kremlin for **security**, and honourable members and other people who  work  here will be harried in doing their jobs.

* This concept of neutrality has yet to be clearly articulated, but there is no doubt that there is a strong feeling, backed by Indonesia, that ASEAN should be developed as a **security** medium in a context of neutrality for the countries in the region.

* Politics in this country no longer runs on the basis of mindless appeals to secrecy and **security**.

* But let us have no more of this assumption that **security** plus secrecy is a vote-winning combination and that the electorate is neither to be trusted nor informed.

* Let me point to 3 statements which have been made; firstly, the statements made by the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  on a recent 'Monday Conference', secondly,  Mr Peter  Westerway's interview with management consultants in Sydney and, thirdly, the address of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean)  to **security** analysts.

* We have a stable and scandal-free Government and until very recently we had freedom from violence and threats to **security**.

* For example, there has been the fear of inadequate **security** for retirement, illness, the education of a family and the provision of a home.

* With  Mr Ian  Wilson- 
This is also the case in the field of health where there was a tremendous opportunity for good work to be done by the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Have any Australian intelligence agencies within his Department resumed contacts with the South African Bureau of State **Security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The attention of the Department of Social **Security** was drawn to the findings- 
Under the present law, a partly secured creditor has in relation to the unsecured portion of his debt the same rights as any other unsecured creditor.

* A fully secured creditor can, at present, exercise all his rights under his **security**, or alternatively, surrender his **security** for the benefit of creditors generally and proceed as if he were an unsecured creditor.

* One is urgency and the other is **security**.

* In the case we are considering it obviously was not **security** so it must be urgency.

* One is urgency, and the other is **security** If this reference was urgent it could have been referred to the Committee.

* He said: 'I am not asking for the **security** services of this country to be placed under parliamentary scrutiny'.

* He said: 'I am not asking for the **security** services of this country to be placed under parliamentary scrutiny.'

* He commands ministerial responsibility for the activities of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* So, I say to the honourable gentleman: I think he is dead wrong with respect to his argument on this matter because the only body in existence which has an administrative responsibility for surveillance, superintending, scrutinising, considering and assessing the activities of bodies which may or may not operate in this country is the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The work of the  **security**  organisation is entrusted to highly qualified men who can be considered to be completely impartial.

* Again, a former late member of this Parliament asked the then Attorney-General, the right honourable member for Barton,  Dr Evatt,  whether he would make any comment about **security** activities.

* Dr Evatt  said: 
Under the charter issued to the Director-General of **Security** the matters referred to by the honourable member are within the responsibility of the Director-General and it is not in the interests of **security** to disclose the information available to him or his opinions and his actions.

* I call now as my witness on the divulging of **security** information, none other than the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr E. G. Whitlam).

* The Leader of the Opposition said: 
I do not concede that **security** services should be answerable to the Parliament.

* On the same day in 1973 the honourable gentleman was asked another question on **security** matters and he said: 
The Director-General of **Security** and I realise that it is quite improper and it is unprecedented to reveal and to publicise **security** documents or  conversations  concerning **security**.

* Government's attitude relative to the resolution of the United Nations **Security** Council on this matter?

* I also noticed in the evening papers that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has made similar suggestions to the Cabinet.

* The Committee was very concerned with these two aspects, that is, the question of **security** within the installation itself and the transportation of animals from the airport or sea port to the quarantine station.

* Let me also refer to the delays in the high **security** offshore quarantine station project which was also examined by the Public Works Committee.

* In its fifth report for 1973 dated 13 September 1973 it recommended that an offshore high **security** quarantine station be established on West Island in the Cocos group.

* Only in that way can we effectively advance our objectives of peace and **security**.

* There is a yearning in the world for peace and **security**.

* Such a development would not merely be dangerous to our **security**; it would greatly restrict our freedom of action across the whole range of our foreign policy objectives.

* What we are seeing is a tremendous rise in the cost of living and a diminution in the financial and other **security** which people in this country have grown accustomed to having.

* The Government's pOliCY is undermining the **security** not only of the country as a whole but of practically aU individuals in it.

* What **security** will I have and what **security** will my family have?'

* by leave - As we have made plain for many months and as we have asserted in the speeches delivered on Australia's behalf in the General Assembly and by the resolutions we have co-sponsored, we have supported the representation of the People's Republic of China in the General Assembly and their occupation of the seat on the **Security** Council.

* We are therefore pleased that the People's Republic of China will now be enabled to be represented in the United Nations and take the seat on the **Security** Council.

* In view of the vote on the Albanian resoluion no vote will now be taken on the dual representation resolution of which Australia was also co-sponsor with 18 other countries, and which in its terms would have provided for the representation of the People's Republic of China and its taking the seat on the **Security** Council and would also have provided for the continued representation of the Republic of China.

* 1 ) Has bis attention been drawn to reports that the Ambassador and staff of the Australian Embassy in Belgrade were subject to harassment by officers of the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation.

* An important section of the Department of Social **Security** deals with the provision of a supporting mother's benefit.

* We have more offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service being opened and more offices of the Department of Social **Security** being opened.

* I believe that as a part solution- I do not believe the problem can be fully overcome because it is one which will face any government- there ought to be more social **security** inspectors put out on the road to do spot checking.

* I know of no case involving the Parliament or national **security** so far- I exclude the event which occurred on 13 February- in relation to which evidence has been produced of organised political terrorism.

* Where was the **security** this morning?

* Where was the **security** the day after the Parliament opened?

* I want to make clear our view in regard to the Indian Ocean- an area which presents the greatest possibility of instability in terms of the defence and **security** of this country.

* This is a result of a desire to ensure Australia's **security** and regional stability.

* Australia has a responsibility to demonstrate that it is prepared to take realistic measures to strengthen its **security** within the means available to us.

* It is also fundamental to our **security**.

* It is now a matter of bipartisan acceptance in Australian politics, I would hope, that the North- West Cape communications centre is an essential element in Australia 's overall **security** position.

* With the possibility of reopening the Suez Canal, this arrangement takes on added significance for Australia's **security**.

* In the case of Ansett borrowing overseas with a Commonwealth guarantee to finance the purchase of aircraft, the Commonwealth has protected its financial interest as guarantor by taking a mortgage over the aircraft relating to the borrowings; the collapse of ASL has in no way affected this **security**.

* I wish to direct my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* -This evening I want to speak on a matter concerning social **security**, but before I do so I should like to make 2 comments.

* If the safety and **security** of this country, both in the economic and defence field, are at stake and at risk, then my personal opinion- I believe it is the opinion of many people to whom I have spoken in recent weeks throughout Queensland and New South Wales- is that any action that we might take to ensure the safety and **security** of this country should be taken.

* As I said, I want to speak tonight particularly about a matter relating to social **security**.

* I did not speak to the responsible Minister in this place because the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Wheeldon)  is in another place, and I felt that he could take the information from Hansard.

* The House may recall that I have on a number of occasions raised the matter of people in rural industry receiving social **security** benefits, even though those people may have a property, because if their income is nil they certainly cannot eat the grass on their properties.

* The gentleman in this case writes: 
If I may make the following comments: In the letter from the  Chairman,  Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal, of September 11, the statement that I am "not available for fulltime outside employment" is surely an incredible one, when the record shows that I have registered for fulltime employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service and inquired at that office at regular intervals for the past twentyone weeks.

* My argument is that the case presented by this gentleman, I believe, should be given consideration and he should be granted social **security** payments.

* I now refer to a letter from the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal dated 23 July.

* The letter is addressed to the person concerned, and it reads: 
The Tribunal sought, and has received, a report from the Department of Social **Security** on your case.

* We are writing to you concerning your appeal against a decision by the Department of Social **Security**.

* Quite frankly, I believe that the comment of the gentleman who made representations to me in this case and the comment made by the Appeals Tribunal make it clear that this gentleman should receive the social **security** benefit.

* I believe also that it justifies what we on this side of the House have said on many occasions, and that is that if a person is unemployed, even though he has a property, and if he is available for employment, should receive the social **security** benefit during that period of time when he is not able to find employment.

* The first responsibility of government is to provide the nation with **security** from armed attack and from the constraints on independent national decisions .

* could jeopardise Australia's **security**.

* There was a clear implication in what he said that there are sectional purposes for which the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation exists- specifically as a wing or adjunct of government rather than national purposes which might be expressed and examined in a bipartisan way and in which the Opposition would reasonably be involved.

* Unfortunately, we have a 'cult of **security**' instead of a 'cult of scepticism' where things are examined with due proportion.

* ASIO's ugly sister in New Zealand is SIS, the **Security** Intelligence Service.

* **Security** services such as ASIO seem to have three main functions: Intelligence gathering, intelligence suppression and negative employment.

* But I would say this: If those rights were to be infringed, they would have to be on very strong grounds, so great that it was palpably a case where national **security** was involved.

* It claims in the 'West Australian' last week that it offers the greatest **security** to pOliCy holders and offers the most comprehensive policies.

* The Narcotic Drugs Act controls the licit manufacture of narcotic drugs, provides for **security** of manufacture and also for control over narcotic drugs when in transit through .Australia to another country.

* **security** (under the Narcotic Drugs Act) of licit manufacture, handling and movement of drugs.

* Further, this scheme has been condemned by every organisation with any medical knowledge or connection at all, except for a few isolated groups of doctors who have been either brainwashed by the Minister for Social **Security** or financed or assisted in some way to put out their untrue and lying propaganda.

* Of course the Minister for Social **Security** supports what these doctors say.

* It is impossible to prove whether the Minister for Social **Security** knew of the advertisement, whether he assisted in drawing it up or assisted in financing it, but it is extraordinary that the contents of the advertisement follow so closely on the statements that the Minister has made constantly over a long period during which he has taken a great deal of trouble, through the mass propaganda means at his disposal, to make untrue and misleading accusations against extremely reputable people in many organisations and professions throughout Australia.

* Equally too do we believe in taking part in the **security** developments of the whole of the South East Asian area.

* Then, if I read it correctly, he inserted something about the **security** of the country.

* I refer to the report by the Senate Committee of Privileges on the appropriate means of ensuring the **security** of Parliament House.

* The statement of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  clearly sets out the Government's policy, and I believe that it may be summarised as follows: Firstly, a majority Australian control over both equity and policy of our resources development; secondly, the coordination of a national fuel and energy policy; thirdly, regulated exploration, development, transportation and marketing of oil, natural gas or related hydrocarbons; fourthly, recognition that petroleum is a finite mineral resource; fifthly, the need for a fuel and energy budget; sixthly, recognition that adequate dependable low cost supplies are crucial to this nation's progress and **security**; and seventhly, the imperative need to recognise that control of and responsibility for our national fuel and energy resources must be exercised by a national government and not left to the whim of private individuals or companies whose basic motivating force is private profit and gain.

* This whole area of fuel and energy is the one basic area where beyond question control must be exercised in the national interest in terms of our future progress and **security**.

* That progress and **security** can only be safeguarded and protected by a national government.

* But concerned as they are with the high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**, they provide the essential framework for the attainment of those national goals.

* The AIDC is to be specifically restrained from using its capital other than as **security** to raise finance principally overseas.

* We can see that the capital of the AIDC is intended only to provide the **security** for the raising of sufficient funds for the particular projects in which it desires to invest.

* The capital will be there as a **security** on which to borrow funds.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-In the few minutes left I want to talk about peace and **security** for the people of the western suburbs of Sydney, particularly as regards the question of youth unemployment.

* Article VII of the Philippines agreement- that is, Article VI of the model and Finland texts- weakens the physical **security** provisions by taking away the requirements of earlier texts for review and updating.

* Were there other amounts paid in respect of **security** agents and the like; if so, what were the amounts and other details, including the dates the services were provided.

* There are many things about the Government's social **security** program with which, naturally, I find myself in great sympathy for the simple reason that they represent a continuance  of  the activities and the attitudes which were initiated under a previous government.

* But young people with a forming family are a class of people who are due for real assistance when the social **security** program is expanded, as I believe it will be.

* But for all that, marriage has given warm comfort and great **security** to countless millions.

* If marriage can be dissolved so easily as this Bill provides, the fate and **security** of our children are being ignored.

* Yakob Malik of the Soviet Union not only supported the military activities of Egypt and Syria against Israel, but criticsed the United Nations **Security** Council for even raising the question at the United Nations.

* Finally the **Security** Council has so far met 4 times, but so abortively to this point that it has not yet reached the stage of considering, let alone adopting, any resolution at all.

* In respect of the war itself, the Prime Minister has stated that the first priority of the Government through its membership and chairmanship of the **Security** Council is to attempt to secure a ceasefire.

* Recognising that the chairmanship of the **Security** Council by the Australian Ambassador,  Sir Lawrence  Mclntyre, could make it desirable for Australia to remain as uncommitted as possible in public discussions on the Middle East war, the undersigned nonetheless feel obliged to express the following view: 
The **Security** Council should immediately call for the restoration of the ceasefire and of the ceasefire lines.

* My question is to the Minister for Social **Security** and relates to an allegation which he made during question time on Wednesday of the last week of sitting.

* It is not the practice to reveal the numbers of police used for **security** duties.

* It is my understanding that those people who have been responsible for drawing up the specifications for the new and permanent Parliament House have been paying very close attention to **security** requirements.

* I will have one final check made to make sure that, insofar as it is in within my responsibility, the various **security** arrangements in the briefs for the new and permanent Parliament House are adequate.

* In relation to social **security** and health, the mandate speech states: 
The points I have mentioned in the short time available clearly show that every one of the Government's promises has been broken and it has no intention of ever keeping them.

* We had the tragedy of three people being killed because of the lack of **security** arrangements, with the Army being called out by the Prime Minister, running all over the New South Wales countryside with machine guns and tanks because there was going to be a confrontation; we were going to get rid of the people who had committed this dreadful outrage.

* Why was there such a lack of proper **security** arrangements?

* A report tabled in the Senate on 6 December by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  described the inner suburban areas of Sydney as the most socially and economically demoralised in New South Wales.

* The Green Paper on immigration policy and Australia's population tabled by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 17 March stated: 
In this adjournment debate I draw the attention of the House to a copy of a letter which I received today from the Northern Regional Council for Social Development to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* That region is extremely well served by 2 regional offices of the Department of Social **Security**- that is, at Preston and Greenborough.

* The letter states: 
In effect, the Council is asking the Minister to see that the unemployment and sickness benefit component is placed in the Preston regional office of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Refusals on these grounds have been recorded as refusals or deferrals on **security** grounds.

* If it is improper for  Sir John  Kerr, why is it not improper for  Mr Justice  Murphy of Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation fame?

* The Ministry for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has said that these attitudes have been based on a campaign of misrepresentation.

* Still less is this so if we consider the record of the present Prime Minister, the present Minister for Social **Security** and honourable members opposite in general over the last 5 years.

* Faced with this position - with the ground cut from under their feet - the present Prime Minister and the present Minister for Social **Security** decided to bluff it out - to misrepresent and misrepresent and misrepresent everything about the defects of the present scheme and the elements of their own scheme.

* We can do no better than wish him health and **security** in his retirement.

* My Government rededicates itself to govern for all Australians and to work in partnership with all groups to build an Australia in which its people can have **security**, the knowledge that they can plan ahead with assurance, and that their efforts will be rewarded.

* We have much to witness and look forward to in initiatives of this Government in marrying and integrating education, under the Interim Committee, soon to be the Australian Schools Commission, with the Department of Social **Security**.

* It is gratifying that the Karmel Committee report and the change in emphasis given to this Act by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will mean that more money will be available for residential accommodation.

* I am glad to join the Government and I am glad to hear the voices of the Opposition joining in approving the initiatives and the change in emphasis that has been pioneered in this Act by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* These areas are in government expenditure, wages and salaries, and social **security** and social welfare.

* His  last Minister for Social **Security** conducted an attack on voluntary welfare agencies and took away the basic support which they need to do work which is invaluable in the social **security** and welfare areas.

* The indications are that individuals react to high rates of inflation by seeking higher cash balances to protect their own positions and minimise what they view as risks to their **security**.

* The Government is satisfied that the specification of standards of physical **security** by the International Atomic Energy Agency constitutes the basis upon which national governments can provide strong protection against nuclear terrorism.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in his speech talked about the history of efforts to abolish the means test.

* Yet today- 
This is the Minister for Social **Security**, the man who today claims that he was the one who initiated the idea.

* We need now to look at the proposals of the Minister for Social **Security** as they relate to the members of the community who today are between the ages of 65 and 75, in the case of men, and between 60 and 75 in the case of women.

* In the last session of Parliament, when asked to do something about fulfilling his promise, the Minister for Social **Security** could only cover up his deceit by personal invective and vague and, as yet, unfulfilled promises that the position would be kept under review.

* It is no good the Minister for Social **Security** quoting figures based upon last year's intiation rate, or the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis),  who spoke in an earlier debate, basing his figures on percentages in the present pension rates, which are below the level of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* In his second reading speech, the Minister for Social **Security** included a table in which he tried to present a rosy picture of the proposition that pensions should be increased at the rate of SI.

* The second area in which the Minister for Social **Security** sought to deceive was to include the Budget increase of SI.

* I challenge the Minister for Social **Security** to assure pensioners that future increases will be at a rate not less than 25 per cent of the increases in average weekly earnings.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: 
1 ) Why does the Depanment of Social **Security** treat de facto relationships differently to the Taxation Commissioner.

* There's another aspect- that of our national **security**.

* It is not good enough for the  Deputy  Prime Minister to say now that he was theorising in general terms about Australia's long-term **security**.

* The Opposition is prepared to countenance the use of bugging devices on ministerial warrants in relation to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation subject to the safeguards that we have outlined in the Senate debate which is now taking place.

* The ASIO is not a law enforcement agency; it is a **security** service, and the principle of ministerial responsibility and accountability is appropriate to that area.

* The period of 30 days is already that which applies to mail interception under the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill and we will be moving in Committee an amendment to provide that it is to be the period which is to apply to warrants issued for listening devices under this Act, and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act in relation to Customs offences.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Unions and the Australian Labor Party a special early afternoon briefing without the **security** of the lock-up?

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
How many (a) full-time and (b) pan-time staff are employed on tea-making and distribution in (i) the Head Office and (ii) other offices of the Depanment of Social **Security**.

* Secondly, there is no need at this stage in the debate to quote statements by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  by the Prime Minister himself or innumerable Liberal speakers during the 1975 and 1977 election campaigns concerning their commitment to twiceyearly adjustments.

* If the matter should still be a matter of debate the question was asked in the Senate, I think two weeks ago, of the Minister for Social **Security** whether twice-yearly indexation had ever been dependent on the rate of inflation.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said quite clearly that the policy itself and the introduction of that policy into legislation made no such qualification.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  in introducing this Bill in another place, said: 
A number of other surveys have shown that the percentage of epilepsy and venereal disease among them was 10 times as high as that for the community at large and the incidence of tuberculosis was four times as high.

* The publication  A Place of Dignity  put out by the Department of Social **Security** in June of last year also found that there was a high rate of illness and disability among the homeless persons surveyed.

* I raised this matter during an Estimates committee examination of the estimates for the Department of Social **Security** in September of this year and it was stated quite specifically that the failure by all political parties and governments to adjust these subsidies has caused some financial difficulties for organisations operating under the Act.

* In the evidence given to the Estimates committee of this House on the Department of Social **Security** I was told that the cost of providing food and accommodation subsidies in 1979-80 was $1,160,000.

* That figure represents 0.01 per cent of the Budget outlays for 1979-80 which are classified as social **security** and welfare payments.

* According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  at present subsidies valued at $320,000 are being provided for 44 social welfare workers at 40 different homeless persons' centres.

* Whatever the reason, I strongly suggest to the Minister for Social **Security**, who has constantly advocated a needs approach to welfare, that she give a top priority to re-examining the present funding levels under this Act which services a very needy section of the community.

* Having regard to the discussions among Heads of Government which are to be held at Bowral, additional **security** precautions have been decided upon.

* I was assured by the Prime Minister that the **security** measures taken were the most comprehensive that had ever been mounted in this country.

* It was a joint effort by the Commonwealth and State police forces, **security** and otherwise.

* There will be further consultation with the Commonwealth Government in relation to continued co-operation on **security** work at a Federal and State level.

* But the first and main objective of Medibank will be to ensure that every Australian, regardless of his ability to pay, will have automatic **security** against the cost of medical and hospital treatment.

* His  Party is dedicated to reducing taxation, probably by not giving medical or hospital benefits and by reducing pensions and social **security** services.

* In his second reading speech the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has set out why the Bill has been brought back into this chamber and has covered its objectives.

* I believe in the **security** system.

* My attitude to the Bill and my attitude to the law is that we want a **security** system that is well nigh perfect but, equally, we want to protect the rights of individuals- their civil rights, their right of freedom and their right to live their own lives provided they live within the law.

* I speak of the migrant who does not like to feel that he has to go somewhere and complain about the administration of the law relating to **security**.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 5 August 1978: 
Will the Minister table in the Parliament the document which sets out the guidelines governing the exercise of departmental discretions in the administration of the law relating to the functions of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Board's initiative and expertise have contributed to a new attitide of hope and **security** that is discernible in dairy areas.

* The irony here is that we are told that this knowledge is a great threat to American **security**.

* I think it is a subject on which the Commonwealth should stand up to the States and in housing agreements ensure that these people receiving the limited income from social **security** payments do not have the increase ripped off them by a State housing authority as soon as they get it.

* Surely the thing to do is to ensure that the Department of Social **Security** has the proper staffing and set-up that will allow detection of these offences.

* The Department of Social **Security** has the same problem, although not quite with the numbers , as the Aus.tralian Taxation Office has in picking up tax evaders.

* However, I am advised that pensions provided by the Federal Republic of Germany are not pay- able to non-citizens residing abroad except for those living in countries which have reciprocal agreements on social **security** with the Federal Republic of Germany.

* When 1 was in Italy I had no difficulty in securing a volume of bilateral treaties and conventions which Italy has made on social **security**, not only with the European Economic Community but with other countries which are not in the Community such as Yugoslavia and the Iberian and Scandinavian countries and also with Brazil and Argentina.

* I merely refer to it to show that Italy has had no difficulty whatever in making arrangements on social **security** with countries which have a variety of social systems.

* The Minister for Immigration told my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  on 19th August last: 
The Italian Under-Secretary of State for Immigration -  also covered Article 35 (Social **Security**) of the Migration and Settlement Agreement which requires the 2 governments to study, the possibility of entering into a reciprocal agreement on the payment of the benefits contemplated by the respective social **security** systems.

* I can see why the Government wants to safeguard against possible events; I can see why the Government wants to allow the **security** organisation to place interpretations on likelihoods; but I can also understand the fear of some of the members opposite, that when this definition is left in the hands of those who do not answer to even the Parliament it is possible that that definition could be wrongly interpreted.

* Perhaps the Government sees political advantage in having the Opposition continually offside with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I believe that the protection of the **security** of this nation is way above the level of politics.

* The facts are that as a result of massive increases in administrative costs there has been a reduction in the capacity of the Department of Social **Security**, for example, to meet many of the commitments that I believe that that Department should be looking to meet.

* What I am distressed to see is that in this legislation before the House we see that for the appropriation for the Department of Social **Security** there is a necessary increase of $21m in the current year in order to meet the commitments under the previous Government's Budget.

* It appears that the social **security** vote has gone up when in fact really the postal and telecommunication sections are benefiting.

* For example, salaries of the Department of Social **Security** in 1974-75- that is exactly one year ago in terms of the measure we are now looking at- amounted to $56.56m.

* My understanding is that about 2 per cent of the total vote of Social **Security** is taken up by administration.

* Last year the Department of Social **Security** increased its average employment from 7400 to 8500.

* If I may use the words of our policy, we are dedicated to political liberty and the freedom and dignity of man; safe from external aggression and playing our part in a world **security** order which maintains the necessary force to defend the peace; looking primarily to the encouragement of individual initiative and enterprise as the dynamic force of progress; to make just provision for the aged, the invalid, the widowed, the sick, the unemployed and the children.

* Training scheme and the Community Youth Employment Training programs, but also, importantly, to a big rise in social **security** and welfare payments.

* He nominated social **security**, welfare programs, health and education.

* The suggestion in respect of social **security** payments is that the Government will take action such as restoring the means test for pensioners aged 70 years and over or introducing a means test on the family allowance.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
As stated in the reply to Question No.

* 1676 (page 1884  Hansard,  12 October 1978) the Department of Social **Security** does not knowingly grant pensions or benefits to persons who entered Australia without any entry permit 
Statistics to enable part (2) of the Question to be answered are not available in the Department of Social **Security**.

* We are cutting through the Gordian knot, as I mentioned in my second reading speech, getting rid of the impediments, of all of the conservative concern expressed in the restrictive sort of legislative controls of the Act enacted in April 1972 by the previous Government and saying that if a person in this country establishes a right to a social **security** pension then that is a right that cannot be taken away from that person merely because he goes overseas; he takes the right with htm.

* But the honourable member expressed some unease that perhaps this Bill was too generous and that if we had too much generosity in the provision of social **security** benefits there could easily be a backlash in the community.

* Nonetheless, I agree with the honourable member for Mackellar that there can always be a backlash in social welfare and social **security** programs if they seem to be too generous.

* But in regard to the material things such as services and payments we believe there is still a long way to go, a very long way indeed, if this country's social **security** system is to be lifted up to the ideal standard to which we should aspire, as seems a fitting objective for one of the wealthiest countries in the world.

* This must be done if we are to restore the preeminence that this country once had as a social laboratory in the development of social **security** benefits and services.

* The new Migration and Settlement Agreement has the following principal elements: lt describes the facilities for settlement of Maltese citizens, lt records the rights they enjoy and the obligations they undertake in common with Australian citizens and other citizens; it affirms that Maltese citizens resident in Australia will receive social service arid health benefits which Australia provides to Australian citizens, and that both Governments will make efforts towards reaching agreement on reciprocity in payment of each other's corresponding social **security** benefits.

* Department of Social **Security** 
I am prepared to accept the Government's calculation that on 1970 prices the purchasing power of the Chifley pension would represent only $10.75.

* For this purpose, with the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard a table on the rate and real value of pensions between 1911 and 1964, which was compiled by T. H. Kewley in Social **Security** in Australia'.

* It will be remembered that he asked me whether I would table the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation report from which I quoted.

* I reiterate that on any matters concerning **security** I will make ali the information available to the Leader of the Opposition.

* I believe that whoever holds the position of Leader of the Opposition is entitled to know the basic facts concerning Australia's **security**.

* Yet, a 21 -year-old cleaner from Darlinghurst was sentenced to 12 months gaol for defrauding the Department of Social **Security** of a little more than $1,100.

* It is an argument which previously applied to social **security** widows pensions but which, in a period of some enlightenment, was changed.

* He has left it to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* The situation of a woman who has a child not covered by a war widows pension because it is not a child of the deceased exserviceman whose offspring attract a pension, is that if she applies to the Department of Social **Security** for coverage of that child, the war widows pension is applied as a means test against her in assessing whether the childrens allowance will be paid in respect of that child.

* If she were receiving a social **security** widows pension, the child would be covered automatically, but because she is receiving a war widows pension, she is denied cover for the child under either form of pension.

* In one case the Department of Veterans' Affairs says that it is not the child of the ex-serviceman and in the other case the Department of Social **Security** says to the woman: 'Your widows pension is such that it excludes you, because of the means test, from getting coverage for that child '.

* It was corrected in the case of social **security** pensions where such children who were born subsequent to a woman being widowed were excluded.

* I do not believe that it is the place of veterans' affairs or the social **security** legislation to moralise to the extent of discriminating against people in lowincome brackets for making mistakes that other people can make without any cost at all.

* What it is really saying to that woman is that she has to give up her war widows pension and take a social **security** pension in order to get coverage for that child because of the cross use of the means test.

* Obviously I do not favour a "shut down of social **security**".

* I would like to speak to the Opposition's amendment (16) and to relate this amendment to amendment (24) to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill which, unfortunately, was guillotined, giving us no chance to discuss it.

* It in no way endangers the **security** operation.

* It in no way threatens any particular **security** operation.

* Only one corrective institution, at Bomana near Port Moresby, has a maximum **security** area.

* The maximum **security** area is used only for psychiatric cases, sexual offenders, escapers and recidivists.

* Regulation 137 of the Corrective Institutions Regulations 1959 provides that where a Corrective Institutions officer of the rank of Instructor, Assistant Superintendent or above considers that the conduct of a detainee is so violent as to render it advisable, any of the following means of restraint may be used: 
The Superintendent was acting in  a  situation where he had 2 very difficult remand prisoners and no maximum **security** facilities available.

* I wish to confine my remarks to one small section of the estimates for the Department of Social Securityindeed, it accounts for only about 0.2 per cent of the Government's proposed expenditure on social **security** and welfare in this current financial year- and I refer to the Australian assistance plan which, in my opinion, is one of this Government 's most constructive and exciting initiatives.

* Due to the time constriction involved in all projects having to be approved by the Department of Social **Security** by 30 June this year, the committee worked tremendously hard but found itself at loggerheads with the Department of Social **Security** at times.

* There is some sort of discontinuity after the interesting latter half of the debate on **security**.

* I was thinking of touching on **security** and defence matters in relation to the GovernorGeneral 's Speech.

* I regret that **security** and defence cannot be debated more strongly than they are at the present time.

* I believe that, certainly, the principal duty of any government of whatever political persuasion should be to provide the nation with **security** so that development can be allowed within a civilised framework.

* A government's principal duty is to provide **security** for the nation.

* Firstly, let us look at **security** and the Services.

* Did this group claim that the list was supplied to it by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation?

* How does this leaking of the names of the staff of the JIO affect the relationship between Australia's **security** organisations and foreign **security** organisations, in particular the Central Intelligence Agency?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-I think the events of Timor answer the honourable member's question.

* You could have sought a voice in the **Security** Council.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
to (3) The Department of Social **Security** monitors variations in exchange rates and adjusts Australian social services pensions when the exchange rate between British and Australian currencies varies by 5 cents Australian or more per pound sterling and appears stabilized.

* They are asking Australians to cast aside that nation which has supported Australia in  2  world wars; which, in the darkest hours of World War II, received an almost hysterical call for help from an Australian Labor Prime Minister, which responded to that call and has continued to respond and provide Australia with its greatest **security** against any external threat.

* The honourable member for Lalor would have us destroy that trust and **security**.

* It should be of crucial importance to every Australian to know and appreciate that the very **security** of this country could be threatened should the Australian Labor Party, as presently composed, ever come to power.

* and a senior officer of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization to work for a magazine called 'Analysis' and (b) that the Organization would supply material to discredit members of the Australian Labor Party.

* I mentioned earlier the actions of the former Attorney-General with regard to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and other similar types of activities.

* A great deal has been said about the appointment of a judge as the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I think it is clear enough that a judge can perform this service and the Government whilst it was in Opposition acceded to the idea that  Mr 
Justice Woodward should become the DirectorGeneral of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I think that the Leader of the Opposition stood that point up to knock it over because clearly, although  His  Honour retains his status as a judge, what he will be doing here is what the Act tells him he has to do, namely, to administer the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The service will function under the administrative control of the Attorney-General's Department, but the head of the service will have direct access to me on all matters of moment affecting **security** that he thinks should be considered by the Government, or on behalf of the Government.

* The Attorney-General is the Minister ordinarily responsible for the **security** service, and he will administer the Act.

* The Director-General, however, has, and has had, from the inauguration of the service in 1949, direct access to the Prime Minister in **security** matters affecting the Government as a whole.

* Section 5 of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act- I shall refer only to the parts that are relevant- states: 
to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence .

* and, at the discretion of the DirectorGeneral, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner, as the DirectorGeneral considers to be in the interests of **security**; 
In other words, the functions of the organisation are indeed circumscribed by the Act which sets it up.

* It is simply, as it were, a provision designed to ensure- I am referring again to the given hypothetical circumstancesthat the **security** organisation stays within its brief.

* The fact is that there are regional directors of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in every State, and so in a real sense he proves the point that we are taking.

* I do not see how, with ministerial responsibility as it is in our situation in the Australian Parliament, we would be able properly to run an Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation except in the way that it is run at the moment in its relationship with the Parliament.

* I think that in the situation in which we find ourselves a government which is responsible for the **security** of the country must have responsibility for the **security** organisation.

* In exercising that responsibility the Government must recognise that a **security** organisation must not descend into the political arena.

* But one thing is essential, and that is that the Government have control of and be responsible for its own **Security** Organisation because it alone can guarantee what other honourable members and I have referred to as the necessary element, namely, the independence of the Organisation.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
We have to start from the assumption that the economic development of the SouthEast Asian countries is essential to our own **security** interests.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-The estimates we are debating are those for the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of Health and the Department of Repatriation and Compensation.

* We must also appreciate the tremendous strides that have been taken over the years in the field of social **security**.

* It is noteworthy that the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  was one of the pioneers in social **security** legislation and we should pay tribute to him for for initiating many great moves that have helped unfortunate members of society.

* But we submit that there is a tragedy in the Government's proposals in certain instances in the social **security** field, and that in effect there has been a mistake in emphasis.

* We charge the present Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  with abrogating his responsibilities in this vital matter soon after he assumed the portfolio when he laid down new guidelines which in effect encourage inertia and encourage people to loaf and to become slackers.

* One aspect of the administration of the Minister for Social **Security** that I attack particularly is his complete disregard for old people who are inmates in nursing homes.

* -No, early in the life of the second Whitlam Government there was a change made in the work test by the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden.

* Because of the humanitarian attitude that my colleague the Minister for Social **Security** has on all these matters, he perhaps did go just a little too much on the side of humanitarianism.

* We lead the world in the rate of unemployment benefit we pay, and for that we have to thank my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**, who succeeded in having the unemployment benefit put to the same level as the pension benefit and repatriation benefit.

* Every man and woman wants **security** for himself or herself and family, and want and expect a reasonable share of the affluence that Australia can offer.

* Third, those who work in an industry need **security**.

* Hitherto that **security** has been dependent not only upon a person's own skill as a worker but also on the vagaries of the market place or on the capacity of management to meet changing consumer demands.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  recently revealed in reply to a question from my colleague, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch),  that since Labor has come into power his Department alone has added over 1,800 public servants to its staff, and as a consequence more than $10m annually to the Department's costs.

* America says its objective under the Nixon Doctrine is to ensure United States national **security** and thai of its allies, but at the same time permitting the reduction of United States forces abroad and reducing the likelihood of having combat ground forces in the future.

* In that regard I should mention that there is some spread-eagled constitutionality which could be brought together since the Commonwealth has the constitutional prerogative in regard to housing in the Territories and for such categories of people as Aborigines, students, public servants and a wider range of defence personnel than at present are covered by the Defence Service Homes Act and for certain recipients of social **security** benefits.

* Accordingly, for example, the inadequate staff of the Department of Social **Security** will not be expanded to cope with the payments to increasing numbers of recipients of social **security** and unemployment benefits.

* Every month this Government continues with its destructive, distorting and regressive policies it increases the difficulty of returning to economic stability and **security**.

* I can understand the sensitivity of the Australian Labor Party about the remarks that were made by my colleague in New York yesterday because I believe this shows the unbridgeable gap in both ideology and policy between the Labor Party and Liberal members on this side of the House in the coalition government on the question of the nation's **security**.

* Equally too do we believe in taking part in the **security** developments of the whole of the South East Asian area.

* We on this side of the House believe that it is crucial to the long term **security** of this country.

* It provides for the Minister for Social **Security** to approve a common form of agreement.

* I have in mind that the membership will consist of a representative of the State association representing eligible organisations, a representative of either the Australian Society of Accountants or the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and an officer from the Department of Social **Security**.

* Such people are notified in writing of the reason for the termination or rejection and they are then able to appeal to the social **security** appeals tribunal in their State.

* These tribunals normally consist of two independent members, usually a lawyer and somebody qualified in the social welfare field, and a person seconded from but not acting for the Department of Social **Security**.

* The normal procedure before a grant under the Australian Assistance Plan is approved by the Minister for Social **Security** is 
The Regional Council submits its recommendations concerning projects to be funded to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Department of Social **Security**, if necessary, investigates alternative sources of funding of projects.

* On the recommendation of the Department, the Minister for Social **Security** considers approving projects for funding.

* In fact, when the suggestion first surfaced, possibly 12 months ago, that a person had registered as a lion tamer in Queensland to obtain unemployment benefits in the belief that he could not be directed to a job as a lion tamer, the Department of Labour and the Department of Social **Security** checked the report with all their offices in Queensland.

* They are always concerned that someone may 'fiddle' a little somewhere along the line with social **security** benefits, but for more than 20 years they took no action in respect of people who fiddle in a massive way in the taxation scheme and engage in corrupt practices in business and commerce.

* The final thing I want to say about unemployment and sickness benefits, and about social **security** benefits generally, is that one has a choice in the way in which these matters are administered.

* I congratulate the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Bishop),  for seeing that this area of anomaly between the Department of Social **Security** and the Repatriation Department has been straightened out.

* On the second last day on which this House sat before the recess, which was 22 April, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  introduced the Bills which we are now debating.

* In the company of the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  who is the Leader of the House on this side of the chamber, I spoke to the Minister for Social **Security** and the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  and said: 'Look, if you want these Bills passed before the House rises for the recess we will give them to you today or tomorrow with the minimum of debate and we will be prepared to pass them in the Senate'.

* When I made the offer in company with the honourable member for New England, the Leader of the House and the Minister for Social **Security** said: 'Yes, we will do that and bring them on tomorrow'.

* I do not attach any blame in this to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* But as I pointed out to the Minister for Social **Security** in another speech, because of the way in which this Government is mismanaging the economy, with rampant inflation and with unemployment rising, it might be to the disadvantage of pensioners to have their pension indexed and tied to average weekly earnings.

* The Department of Social **Security** is now responsible for policing the abuses of unemployment benefits and because of the overwork associated with the economic situation the policing has not been carried out on a sufficiently large scale.

* Now only one form must be lodged monthly with the Department of Social **Security** to keep those cheques rolling in, and that form can be lodged by mail.

* To allow it to be done by proxy once a month means that a person can sit at home, post the form each month to the Department of Social **Security** and collect a cheque.

* I am also concerned about the Department of Social **Security**.

* It is headed: 
Six-hour wait at Social **Security** office.

* At 9.30 a.m. yesterday,  Mrs Gloria  MacLennan arrived at the Department of Social **Security** .

* -Do you find it amusing that people have to wait 6 hours at the Department of Social **Security**?

* In another area in my electorate, the PrestonReservoir area, in January of this year 1800 people were receiving the unemployment benefit, according to Department of Social **Security** figures.

* The Department of Social **Security** ought to encourage such voluntary action by providing financial assistance for such centres.

* In the time remaining to me in this debate I wish to protest against the decision of the Department of Social **Security** to cease giving financial assistance to FILEF- the Federation of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Familieswhich does so much work among migrants of Italian origin in my own area.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Social **Security** and refers to the high cost of orthondontic treatment for children with a cleft palate or a Up condition.

* -Since taking office, this Government has set a record of improvements in social **security** which would be pretty hard to fault.

* There has been in the past an odd sort of ' me too ' quality about their attitude to our movements in social **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has begun a thorough review of the whole system of financing and constructing homes for the aged because he believes there is a strong possibility that these homes are not operating in the best interests of the community, the taxpayers or the people with limited means who need accommodation.

* The Treasurer was simply not telling the truth when he said that we now enjoy greater social **security**.

* It wants, and must be given, a better health plan for its sick; and it wants, and must be given, greater social **security** and dignity for those who are sick or too old to work.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The cost of compiling a draft manuscript for a proposed booklet on support services available to women was almost entirely related to staff salaries and office expenses and involved, as well as staff time within the Department of Social **Security**, information contributions from officers of other Government departments and voluntary agencies.

* It is estimated that, within the Department of Social **Security**, staff salary costs and office expenses of some $7,000 were involved.

* The Department of Social **Security** did not provide a copy of the manuscript for the Directory to  Woman's Day  nor authorise its publication.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has pointed out, it is intended that there will be a cost sharing arrangement with the State governments to provide adequate public hospital accommodation.

* This week the Minister for Social **Security** announced some very substantial increased benefits for nursing home patients.

* I am quite sure that the Minister for Social **Security** would be the first to agree with that proposition.

* -The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill broadly legitimises the use of totalitarian techniques, even if it is done in the name of democracy, and removes such use from scrutiny and accountability in the Parliament.

* The amendment is a compromise proposal; it does not involve bringing the activities of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation under complete public scrutiny, even within this House.

* It is notorious that leaders of the opposition in Great Britain have been quite heavily involved in **security** matters.

* Suffice it to say in general terms at this stage that the Minister for Social **Security** arranged last week for a meeting of private hospitals to be called in Melbourne and to be addressed by two of his departmental representatives, Messrs Deeble and Corrigan.

* I have been informed by my colleague, the honourable member for Hotham, that he has sought from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  copies of the Bills which are now to be presented to the House.

* Apparently the Minister for Social **Security** is not in a position to provide copies of the Bills.

* Nobody will be willing to make loans to those who have lost all their **security**.

* In most instances, I suppose, they have gone beyond the normally accepted degrees of **security** because of the excessively severe drought conditions.

* The Minister for Social **Security** and I take the attitude that public statements on the economy should come in the first place from the Treasurer.

* I put the point of view that judges can properly advise on public issues if they hold statutory appointments, for example, under the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act or the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, or if they hold royal commissions.

* It ment does not seem to me that it helps industrial relations very much in this country to have the Department that is there to assist in the good relations between the parties involved in this affair setting itself up as some police authority to furnish the Department of Social **Security** with information so as to deny the unemployment benefit to a person who is a member of a union which is taking industrial action.

* One can conceive that many more people will be needed in the Department of Social **Security** should we have a spate of industrial disputes leading to the standdown of numbers of people and it becomes necessary to identify what unions they are members of.

* If a person turns up at the Department of Social **Security** and says: 'I am not a member of the union,' he will be paid his unemployment benefit.

* The House will also be aware of the action to implement this promise in mid- January last when the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and I announced a number of measures designed to tighten the unemployment benefit work test.

* Between May 1975 and January 1976 some 112 000 beneficiaries were selected for field officer visits by the Department of Social **Security**.

* Often the beneficiaries have only recently obtained work and have had little time to notify the Department of Social **Security**; their domestic circumstances have altered in a way which disqualifies them from benefit; they may no longer satisfy the work test requirement; or they have left their normal address and have not notified the Department Of course, in some cases there is blatant misrepresentation.

* There is excellent **security** in view of world market prices for wheat and estimated returns and world shortages.

* They were concerned not only about the immediacy but also about the future and **security**.

* The **security** of the world is no longer in the hands of 2 superpowers conducting a cold war, we being a satellite of one of them.

* So one looks to the Budget to see whether the Government has adequately taken into consideration our national **security** without which all our domestic concerns are as nothing, because the preservation of the state is the first requirement.

* So the Government prudently is looking to the **security** of this nation upon which all the other things we have must rest.

* In terms of overseas capital, the AIDC has a very important role to play - which of course it has played in the past - of mobilising large amounts of capital with the authority and **security** that any government body enjoys.

* But the proposition that the development issue and Australia's **security** are quite unrelated and therefore our development assistance efforts will have no impact on our long term **security** is misleading, if not untenable.

* The proposition should really be that ineffective development assistance does nothing to promote Australia's **security** interests in the long term.

* An effective aid program will help to promote national well-being and stable political conditions and, as such, an improvement in such a program can only enhance regional **security**.

* To this end I have placed the following conditions on the use of the House by SEATO: The first condition is that senators, members and visitors in the company of a senator or member, provided they are recognised by House attendants who will be stationed alongside each SEATO **security** guard, are to be permitted to proceed without any restriction through any passageway or corridor in the building.

* The second condition is that no Service personnel, either in or out of uniform, are to be used for the purpose of providing **security** guards in the House.

* The third condition is that **security** guards for the conference areas are to be members of the Commonwealth Police Force who will not wear uniform but will be identifiable by a lapel badge only.

* As a resident of Alice Springs naturally I welcome the Pine Gap base because, as I have said before, not only is it of tremendous advantage to the **security** of Australia but especially of tremendous advantage to Alice Springs.

* No one has complained either about the one at Amberley, which is also doing an outstanding job for the **security** of Australia.

* Because changing circumstances have brought about some knowledge of these bases and the Minister for Defence has been briefed he is able to see the vital importance of these bases to Australian **security**.

* I only hope that he takes note of the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition so that we can go into this joint **security** business side by side.

* I can only hope that the Minister continues to disagree with the left wing sentiments of members of his Party who have been pressuring him both inside and outside the Parliament to have these major **security** bases closed.

* However, I hope that the Government does not bow to the left wing element in the Australian Labor Party because that is the group which realises that these bases are of great importance to the **security** of Australia.

* I now move: 
The Government, the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs stand condemned for their absolute disinterest in migrant welfare and services.

* That argument can be taken into the area of social **security** generally.

* People are becoming more and more aware of the sorts of figures that were mentioned in the last Budget Speech, that 57c in every dollar that is raised in tax goes into the area of social **security**.

* The honourable member for Hindmarsh might be interested in the fact that the last time the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  made statistics available, on a postcode basis, of where the pensions were going, I went through them and extracted all the details relating to postcodes in the electorate of Hume.

* The figures showed that one person in five- we can assume that is one adult in five- is in receipt of some sort of social **security** benefit.

* So I suppose that every two and a half adults in the community who are working- and certainly not all adults are working because there are a lot of wives at home who do not work- are supporting somebody on a social **security** or repatriation or unemployment-type benefit.

* Everyone, most of all the low income earners or those on social **security** other than age pensioners, know the situation is a farce.

* I should also stress that, although we are seeking to provide patients with **security** against the costs of specialists' services, the Government does not wish to create a situation in which the cost of the new plan is inflated by unnecessary and frivolous demands for specialist treatment.

* As I have stated on many previous occasions and emphasise again now, the Government strongly supports the common fee concept primarily because we earnestly desire to provide the Australian people with a substantial degree of **security** against the cost of medical treatment The Government is also cognizant of the desirability of conducting the health benefits plan in such a way that the standards of medical practice and the legitimate interests of the medical profession are effectively safeguarded.

* We are convinced that, with the co-operation of doctors in adhering to the common fees, patients can be provided with the **security** which they require and to which we firmly believe they are entitled.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has said that the income **security** review committee is examining the whole range of benefits with a view not only of rationalising the odds and ends that now exist, but also of producing a new, better and more meaningful scheme of income assistance for those who are in need.

* The Government is proceeding with the review of the income **security** system as a whole, including the effectiveness of guaranteed income and proposals for overcoming poverty.

* At the time changes were made to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill, which did not go through a legislation committee, and the Customs Bill, which did, the House agreed to the changes for two very emotive reasons; firstly, the question of national **security**, and secondly, the question of narcotics.

* We are handing over to a police force, powers which have never before been handed over, except in the name of national **security**.

* He demonstrated, in what he said, that the **security** that lies within the context of agreements such as this is not for him.

* The only **security** he seeks is some type of continued dialogue with the people of the communist countries to our north, communist countries whose future relationship with each other, even if not with us, is uncertain, communist countries in our region whose threat each and every member of the Labor Party denies.

* We do not believe in warmongering, but we do believe in **security** and defence.

* I refer very quickly in passing to clause 8 (2) (a) of the Bill which allows the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to place Ministers of the Crown, even the Prime Minister or the AttorneyGeneral, under surveillance.

* The amendment provides that the Minister shall not be afforded access to the record of a particular individual unless the Director-General considers that it is in the interests of **security** that the Minister should have such access.

* It seems to me that one could not want for anything milder than that, because it really gives the Director-General power to rule on virtually any file the contents of which it is in the interests of **security** should not be revealed.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
**Security** arrangements for the hangar and aircraft prior to the fire; 
Of course, there was hesitation on the part of certain manufacturers and from one's own experience there can be no denying the cautious nature in which the Australian trading banks, including the Government owned and directed Commonwealth Trading Bank, moved into accepting the insurance paper of EPIC as collateral **security**.

* However, such are the rigours of bank practices in Australia that collateral **security** is required especially when terms of 5 years and more are specified.

* These extensions of protection have resulted in an increasing use being made by Australian exporters, albeit by rural industries, and if must be admitted that the Export Payments Insurance Corporation has made a worthwhile contribution to Australia's exporting programme to move, as provided Australian exporters with the large degree of **security** which has been necessary for the penetration of new markets.

* But in the matter of insurance and **security** relating to the operation of these aircraft there is room to effect a worthwhile economy by effective **security** measures and hopefully in the longer term some reduction of world tensions and dissension that may give these aircraft and, more importantly, their passengers, safe passage through the air.

* Most importantly, public housing can provide a necessary minimum of **security** for low income earners in need of shelter.

* The Home Savings Grants Scheme does not begin to address the needs of those people who have no **security** of shelter.

* As has been stated, very rightly I think, by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  the matter before this Committee which is set out in paragraph 1 of the motion before us is very wide.

* Here again I think that the 
House should take note of what the Minister for Social **Security** said because he implied, and 1 think quite rightly, that such things as wages and wage conditions insofar as they affect prices would properly be before this Committee and it will, if the.

* It is quite true that if one takes what the Minister for Social **Security** said in this House a moment ago, all the matters that I have talked about will come properly within the scope of this Committee.

* It just seems to me that perhaps it would have been better if they had said what they meant and it would perhaps have been better if the protestations of the Minister for Social **Security** were in fact included in the draft terms of reference in paragraph 1 of this motion.

* I would rather have thought that the Government would welcome it because it makes clearer what the Government professes to say through the mouth of the Minister for Social **Security** is the real impact and import of this motion before us.

* It could be that on some occasions when it gives its view on what may happen to the work force, we need other operatives, perhaps from the Department of Social **Security** and from manpower sections of the Government, to look at those recommendations to see what can be done.

* I believe that the Government has in many ways opted out of its real responsibilities to give us a co-ordinated approach to industry, manpower, **security**, location, migration and education- all the heads of policy that ought to be taken into account when one talks about the future life of our industries and the future **security** of the working people.

* Since then my colleagues the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social **Security** and I have met.

* I shall take this opportunity of saying that yesterday I told the House that I had not seen the Director-General of **Security** since late on the afternoon of Saturday 17 March.

* Finally, by its response of sabre rattling it is clearly taking an approach which is at best irrelevant and at worst harmful to the **security** of this country.

* Mr Spiers  stated: 
For about the fourth time this session I ask the Government to act in the interests of the **security** of the area in which we live by taking real diplomatic initiatives, particularly having in mind India and Pakistan which are going through a particularly critical period.

* This is what we should be doing to try and advance the **security** of our nation.

* There is widespread acceptance that the objectives of a new International Wheat Agreement should include the stabilisation of world wheat markets in order to help ensure adequate supplies at reasonable prices and improved world food **security**.

* The concept of reserve stocks to help stabilise the world supplies and prices and improve world food **security** has been discussed in some detail.

* We are particularly conscious of the need to avoid undue risks that a world stockpile of grains might depress world market prices to unacceptably low levels, thereby prejudicing the Agreement itself and, importantly, the objective of helping to ensure continuing stability of supplies in the interests of the world food **security** objectives.

* I ask the Minister: Will he have consultations with his colleague the Minister for Social **Security** to see whether the Act can be altered to allow a primary producer who loses his income and cannot obtain employment to be eligible for social service benefits?

* Is the Minister for Social **Security** aware of the resolution passed at the Bendigo Conference of the Australian Natives Association which stated that the Association would cooperate fully with the Australian Government in order to ensure a speedy and efficient introduction of Medibank?

* In the last 12 months the Council has been continuing to exchange correspondence with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  protesting about the fact that the subsidy which has traditionally been paid by the Commonwealth Government towards the salary of the welfare officers has been reduced from twothirds to one half, which seems to me to be a fairly penny-pinching sort of operation, anyhow.

* I would think that there would be a reasonable argument that could be made out to try to coerce the Minister for Health to do something about his sister department, the Department of Social **Security**, seeing whether some good sense could be brought to bear to ensure that subsidies- as low as they were before with two-thirds of the salary of welfare officers being found by the Government- were restored to a reasonable level and also with a view to seeing that the 50c a day pittance paid to Meals on Wheels was increased to a figure more in line with the actual cost.

* But no one has seen fit to talk very much about the tremendous happenings around the world in the last two weeks, their great import to Australia, and their effect on Australia and on the **security** of this nation.

* They have never cared about the **security** of this nation.

* The package included a special new **security**, the Australian Savings Bond, which was outstandingly successful in supporting the February loan raisings.

* The Government will proceed with a review of the income **security** system as a whole, including the effectiveness of guaranteed minimum income proposals in overcoming poverty.

* The nation's **security** is a prime concern of the Government.

* The Government will watch the international situation closely to ensure timely warning of any changes adverse to the nation's **security** interests.

* -I propose to speak on the need for a maximum **security** veterinary laboratory in Australia.

* If the worst came to the worst, a maximum **security** diagnostic laboratory would reduce this period.

* In the event of a major exotic disease entering Australia, veterinary authorities would be severely handicapped by the absence in this country of a laboratory with a great enough degree of microbiological **security** to enable highly infectious material to be handled without any danger of the disease agent escaping and causing further outbreaks.

* Should vaccination be adopted for control and eradication, maximum **security** facilities would be essential for testing and potency and safety of the vaccines used.

* Moreover, if it became necessary to vaccinate livestock against foot and mouth disease, maximum **security** facilities would be required for both the production and the testing of a suitable vaccine.

* This testing can be carried out only in a maximum **security** laboratory.

* If the station is to draw livestock from countries where diseases such as foot and mouth, rinderpest and blue ton gue are endemic, separate maximum **security** laboratory facilities must also be provided in which special tests can be carried out to ensure that livestock held at the station is completely free from exotic diseases before being allowed entry to Australia.

* A maximum **security** laboratory would, in addition to facilitating the importation of livestock and acting as an insurance against the introduction of exotic diseases, provide a valuable and much needed facility for research on virus diseases already endemic in Australia.

* Research on these viruses; several of which affect man as well as livestock, has been hampered to date by a lack of a maximum **security** laboratory.

* The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories is currently building high **security** not maximum **security** facilities that will enable it to produce live attenuated vaccines for use against a number of exotic diseases including bluetongue in the event of their entering the country.

* Because of the risks involved, only maximum **security** facilities can be used for foot and mouth disease vaccine production.

* If the laboratory is to deal effectively with any exotic disease that might be introduced, it needs to be manned by a permanent team of highly trained and highly competent virologists who are well versed in **security** procedures.

* I trust that we will act to ensure that Australia has a maximum **security** veterinary laboratory and avoid potential disaster.

* The fart is, sir, that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  might take a view about **security**- a view that he is entitled to have- and you might share that view.

* The specific point I ask you to heed is that I believe the question of the **security** of this Parliament is something about which all honourable members ought to be in agreement, consulted about and involved in.

* I believe that you,  Mr Speaker,  would be doing yourself and this House a great service if whatever **security** measures were taken enjoyed the confidence of all honourable members.

* I believe that whatever **security** measures have to be taken ought to have full regard to the very important privileges and rights that are attached to this Parliament.

* I am also conscious that within the parliamentary democracy it is fundamental that people who are elected to come here and serve and those people who serve the members and senators must have **security** or they will not be able to fulfil the functions for which they were elected.

* For that reason I have been very anxious that there be no greater inconvenience than is absolutely necessary for the level of **security** which we would wish to have.

* I am bound to say that even with the level of **security** which we have now adopted there will be risks entailed for all members of the Parliament.

* States item for the Department of Social **Security**.

* I will not cite the figures in respect of the total expenditure of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Expenditure for the Department of Social **Security** is down from $68.75m to $60m.

* So, the total drop in the appropriation for capital works and services of the Department of Social **Security** is $8.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 7 March 1978: 
1 ) How many persons who, after receiving unemployment benefits, had those benefits terminated on the grounds that they were ineligible or received other social **security** benefits during (a) 1976 and (b) 1977.

* property confers advantages on its owner independent of, and additional to, the income it yields: it serves as a reserve of spending power in emergencies and thus reduces the need to save out of income, it provides **security** for old age and heirs, it provides opportunities for reducing income tax liability by income-splitting, it gives the owner access to credit, it is a necessary condition of business enterprise, and it confers social status and prestige.

* In October of last year a lady doctor from the Department of Social **Security** visited that little girl at Singleton.

* I immediately contacted the Department of Social **Security**, but I did not have success in persuading the Department to alter its decision.

* So I took the matter to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* A fortnight ago the Minister took up the matter with the Director-General of Social **Security**.

* Let us hope that what I have said in this speech will come to the attention of the Minister and the Director-General of Social **Security** and that some action will be taken to assist Priscilla 's parents.

* Of that increase, $2 10m was for social **security** and welfare.

* Is there any member of the Opposition who says we should not have provided $2 10m in the field of social **security** and welfare?

* No analysis has been made of why the existing **security** arrangements were wanting.

* No explanation has been given of why the conference took place in a venue that local **security** authorities advised was not suitable because of the difficulty of maintaining adequate **security**.

* The beneficiaries of this incident, because of careful use of the media, were the **security** services, the very services which failed us.

* The impetus is given to allocating more funds to and expanding police forces and **security** forces.

* It placed **security** matters ahead of economic matters at a time when a dramatic increase has occurred in unemployment, which is not solely attributable to school leavers, the currency is under threat and Australia's access to international markets is deteriorating.

* We cannot build tolerance and liberal attitudes if people's minds are preoccupied by the material issues that affect their lives- prices, employment, personal **security**.

* That simply means, in plain English, that if the Minister for Social **Security** believes that a health fund is not bowing to his wishes all he has to do is say: 'You bow to my wishes because I will satisfy myself that you are not acting in the interests of the contributors and I will put an inspector into your organisation.'

* The Minister further states: 
**Security**, he is not.

* God knows where the Minister for Social **Security** is tonight, because he is not in the House nor have I received any apology from him for not being here for the debate on this very vital Bill.

* We recognise that in this country we need to be internationally competitive if we are to provide real **security** for any sector of manufacturing industry.

* Departmental practice for the classification of documents is laid down by the Protective **Security** Handbook, issued in June 1978.

* The following are the relevant extracts from the Handbook: 
National **Security** Information 2.1 National **security** information is information affecting the defence, **security** or international relations of Australia.

* According to the estimated prejudice to national **security** which might result from unauthorised disclosure, national **security** information should be given one of the four national **security** classifications: TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL and RESTRICTED which are defined hereunder: 
The record stands.

* I believe the Liberal-Country Party coalition is the one best fitted to look to Australia's **security**, the one most likely to create the conditions for Australia's growth, the one most likely to tackle the causes of poverty at their roots, the one most likely to leave to the individual the maximum chance of using his talents to advance himself and his country.

* No special priority is given to these courses over social **security** measures.

* None of these elements can produce progress, and without progress **security** will turn out to be a delusion.

* We also have to have **security** of tenure for anyone investing and we have to have reasonable private enterprise.

* I think that **security** of tenure is so vital to rnining investment- to me it is as vital as the stable economic conditions that we must have, such as a low rate of inflation and so on, in this country- that we ought to take cognisance of a mining Bill which is before the Western Australian Parliament at the moment.

* But one of the things I am worried about is that this mining Bill seems to reduce **security** of tenure, which might frighten investors.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 15 August, 1978: 
-by leave-On 28 May last year the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  announced that a working party of officials from his department and the Departments of Social **Security**, Education and Employment and Industrial Relations would begin a full study of the problems associated with Aboriginal unemployment.

* His  official Press statement described the problem in these terms: 
We talk about the philosophy spelt out by the Prime Minister a few days ago, but answers given to questions asked of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in another place have contradicted that time and time again.

* Senator Grimes  asked the Minister for Social **Security** whether she would give a detailed statement on cuts to the proposed Children's Commission expenditure.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has an obligation to the Australian community and to people interested in child welfare to spell out the answers to the questions.

* I shall quote some of the final sentences of Richard Hall's book on **security** services which deal with the concern that we have about this clause.

* Referring to domestic **security**, he wrote: 
In my view this clause has been drawn too wide.

* Under this legislation it is open for people in **security** organisations to interpret the actions of such people as actions which will, in the final analysis, lead to the overthrow of the state- to the overthrow of the government of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a territory.

* In the absence of a unilateral decision by that Government to pay its social **security** pensions to former German nationals in Australia the position could be achieved through an appropriate reciprocal agreement.

* The general question of Australia's participation in reciprocal agreements on social **security** with other countries, including West Germany, is one to which the Government is giving earnest consideration.

* Because of the differences between the schemes of social **security** it is difficult to establish a basis which is appropriate to people 's needs while ensuring that financial commitments arising from additional undertakings are kept within responsible limits.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Opposition will not oppose the second reading of this Bill.

* I note that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is not in the chamber at the moment.

* I think that the Minister for Social **Security** was less than fair to the honourable member for Mackellar during his second reading speech in introducing this legislation to the House.

* In the first place there are those, although not affected by the previous Government's legislation in this field, covered by the comprehensive social **security** benefits with the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

* These prohibited areas are declared as such to enable the Government to control entry in the interests of **security** and safety.

* There are established pastoral activities in the areas, and additionally, tourist and mineral exploration activities are permitted insofar as **security** and safety requirements allow.

* The Woomera Prohibited Area will need to be retained for reasons of **security** and safety in carrying out this work.

* Were correct and proper procedures followed by the Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Social **Security** in 1973 with respect to the letting of tenders for two major computer installations?

* What the Government has done has been to say that we believe that if there is any possibility of an officer having a preferred position, having access to confidential information, of being in a position where he might improperly see that a contract is let without all the open scrutiny and without the complete **security** necessary in determining the way in which the tenders are let, then that tender should not be let to that party.

* I think it is important that we look at the whole of the circumstances surrounding the involvement of the Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Social **Security** in 1973.

* Those tenders were let after there had been a visit overseas by officers of the Department of the then Minister for Social **Security**, along with an official of the company concerned.

* Those two standards which he might have been prepared to follow as Minister for Social **Security** are not good enough for this Government; they are not good enough to meet the wishes of the Australian people; they badly need to be roundly condemned.

* From my own observations there have been significant advances in the stability and **security** of the three and four corps areas of South Vietnam - that is, the Mekong delta area and the provinces surrounding Saigon.

* On 29th May 1968 the United Nations **Security** Council adopted mandatory sanctions against the illegal regime.

* Clause 3 of Resolution 277 adopted by the **Security** Council on 18th March 1970 calls upon member States to take appropriate measures at the national level to ensure that any act performed by officials and institutions of the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia shall not accord any recognition, official or otherwise, by the component organisations of their State'.

* Unless the registration is cancelled Australia, not just New South Wales, is in breach of the **Security** Council resolution.

* Apparently the European countries have a right to do whatever they wish in terms of economic **security** but we, as a developing industrial nation, have no right to give degrees of protection if we have problems.

* The Commonwealth Employment Service acts as an agent for the Department of Social **Security** in reporting on whether suitable employment for a given individual is available.

* From time to time Ministers for Social **Security** and Ministers responsible for the Commonwealth Employment Service have established working parties of officials from both departments to examine the administrative arrangements appropriate to these provisions of the Act.

* The Government has decided, having regard to current practice, that it would now be appropriate to establish such a group to review urgently these administrative provisions and to report urgently to my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  and myself.

* In fact, if one looks at the record of speeches that have been delivered thus far in this Budget debate they will see that at least the honourable member has been honest in his references to the enormous cost of providing social **security** benefits in this country today.

* I believe that the Budget and its import, in addition to the economic climate, have to be considered separately from the stance of what are the inescapable demands of responsibilities upon the government of the day, and the area of social **security** is certainly one of them.

* -We have just had about11/2 hours of concentrated legislation dealing with my particular interests of social **security**, health and veterans' affairs.

* I would like to refer to some of the continuing problems associated with health expenditure and expenditure on social **security** items.

* I would like to deal firstly with social **security** payments.

* I rise tonight to express the gratitude of my electorate, particularly the aged people of my electorate, to the very generous, the very sensible and the very just decisions of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in respect of the aged persons' homes policy.

* The electors of Macarthur have every reason to be very pleased with the Minister for Social 
**Security** and her Department, and certainly with the Government 's policy.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Amounts paid by the Department of Social **Security** to each airline for air travel within Australia during the last 2 years is as follows: 
-The House is debating a surprising Bill introduced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  last Wednesday.

* I know that this was a substantial piece of **security** for people such as myself, even elected for seats such as mine.

* The Budget estimate is based on a higher average number of beneficiaries than in 1977-78, but this is partly offset by savings stemming from the review of Department of Social **Security**'s systems and procedures.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 26 April 1977: 
What expenditures have been made in recent years under major programs administered by the Department of Social **Security** in the electoral divisions of Hughes, Cook and Cunningham.

* Although the **security** of tenure of such reserves is less than that of national parks they nevertheless protect substantial areas of rainforest.

* I appreciate the fact that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has acknowledged my representations to him on this matter and has pointed out that a report from his Department on the current maximum subsidy limits has been referred to the Social Welfare Commission for consideration.

* I did ask the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to be in the House this evening but he apologised and said that he was unable to be here.

* In the few moments left to me I would like to mention that the Department of Social **Security** has become our largest Government department in terms of Budget expenditure.

* There are many areas in Australia where I feel that the setting up of an office of the Department of Social **Security** is necessary.

* The city and shire of Swan Hill, together with its surrounding shires, comprises one region which has inadequate access to social **security** services.

* The decentralisation of the Social **Security** Department would contribute to the needs of this large region.

* I have asked the Minister to give me an assurance, if he can, as to the possibility of this progressive, expanding region of Victoria centring on the city of Swan Hill being granted a branch of the Social **Security** Department.

* It is not only a matter of defence or **security** but also matters which would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Department of Social **Security** makes a contribution towards the cost of these facilities but does not have full financial responsibility for them.

* 3893 relating to airport **security**.

* Is he now able to say (a) whether the number of Commonwealth Police in service as at (i) 31 March 1979 and (ii) 30 April 1979 was adequate to meet internationally accepted standards of airport **security**, and (b) what was the (i) establishment and (ii) number of Commonwealth Police in service at each Commonwealth airport for duties associated with airport **security** as at 31 March 1979 and 30 April 1979. 
am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I might say, despite the Minister's noisy interjections, that he is in a fix because of his inadequacies in this matter.

* Under the legislation of a Labor government they will be in a position of **security** compared with their present position.

* This matter refers to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation - the Commonwealth secret service - which is administered by his Department.

* If the Commonwealth requires them for **security** reasons, they most certainly are being misplaced when they knock on the doors of aged pensioners who are not offending in any shape or form.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Neither the Minister for Social **Security** nor any doctor has the legal authority to grant or refuse payment of a handicapped child 's allowance.

* The Director-General of the Department of Social **Security**, who has responsibility for assessing entitlements, may require the child to be medically examined or he may obtain medical advice from a legally qualified medical practitioner.

* The Department of Social **Security** has no information on the first part of the question.

* The proposal comprises: An operations building to accommodate area approach control, flight service centre, the necessary control equipment and training facilities; a services building containing a transformer for the provision of primary power, essential power generation and air conditioning plant; an air traffic control tower accommodating an elevated control cabin, support control equipment and essential power and air conditioning plant; and associated site works, car parks, roads and engineering services, sewerage and drainage and **security** fencing to the operations building and services building area.

* the Prime Minister's attempt to suppress yesterday's statement by the Minister for Social **Security** condemning the Government's handling of the economy; 
Surely the situation has got to a critical stage when a senior Minister, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  who is fourth in the order of precedence in the Labor Government, can tell a meeting of his colleagues that the Labor Party is 'presiding over the destruction of the Australian economy'.

* Questioned about the statement this morning both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** failed to confirm or deny the statement.

* Honourable members may recall that back in 1965 when the economic sanctions were first imposed at the request of Britain the matter was taken up through the **Security** Council of the United Nations and a resolution was passed imposing sanctions to which Australia subscribed at the time.

* subject as prescribed by the preceding subsection, aid granted under that subsection may be of such a type (in money, in kind, or by way of services) and may be granted in such circumstances, on such terms and conditions and, where granted by way of secured loan, on such **security** as the Director thinks fit.'

* So government must take action to ensure that people's financial interests and the **security** of those interests are protected.

* There is not adequate **security**.

* They have found **security** and prosperity here and have made a valuable contribution to our country.

* A standing inter-departmental committee on refugees comprising a senior officer of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as chairman, and senior officers of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Employment and Industrial Relations, Social **Security**, Finance, Health and Education with other departments and the Public Service Board to be co-opted as necessary, will be established.

* 1) Has his attention been drawn to a report, in the  Australian Financial Review  of 24 August 1 977 to the effect that the American Express International Banking Corporation had withdrawn a proposal it had submitted to the Government to take over **Security** Dealers Pry Ltd following a request that it do so.

* We have to be thinking of the pattern and the volume of industry and its employment capacity, not to mention national **security** and other considerations, 5 or 10 years hence.

* Which of the locations have (a) permanent and (b) part-time **security** coverage.

* Are **security** arrangements for the storage of weapons and ammunition at unpatrolled locations, such as Australian Defence Reserve depots, adequate to prevent weapons falling into the hands of criminals or terrorists.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* ( 1 ), (2 ) and ( 3 ) Yes, A letter in the terms indicated was recently received and the correspondent informed that the Government had recently considered the general question of Australia's participation in agreements on social **security** with a number of countries, including West Germany.

* Because of the differing social **security** systems in Australia and West Germany the development of principles for an agreement which would be satisfactory has yet to be completed.

* Two or three speakers on the other side have said that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has refused to cost his scheme.

* He said, as I have said and as the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  has said- as several of us have said- that the best expert extimates of the way the exponential growth of health cost is going now is that if it continues at the present trend it will reach 12 per cent by the year 2000.

* These are legitimate social **security** functions in relation to which the community has a responsibility.

* The Opposition has made much of the scheme that it, as a government, brought in after World War II as being a great advance in the field of social **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who spoke earlier in this debate pointed out that what we are debating today is a system of payment.

* Much has been made of statements by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** that our first nationalisation project would be health insurance.

* Copies of press releases issued by the Minister for Social **Security** are distributed by hand to the Press Gallery, by distribution from the Ministerial Document Reproduction Unit, by mail by the Information Section of the Department of Social **Security** and by publication in the Australian Government Digest 
The cost of producing and distributing press statements is included in costs relating to salaries and administration of the Social **Security** Depanment and, in respect of costs incurred by the Ministerial Document Reproduction Unit, of the Depanment of the Media.

* Discussions with  Dr Bemporad  also covered Article 35 (Social **Security**) of die Migration and Settlement Agreement which requires the two Governments to study the possibility of entering into a reciprocal agreement on the "payment of the benefits contemplated by the respective social **security** systems.

* After reviewing problems relating particularly to age pensions and invalid pensions there was agreement to exchange further detailed information on the social **security** systems in each country, lt was further agreed that following this the subject would be re-examined at the expert level.

* It is true as the honourable member for Mackellar says that the means test is very embarrassing to people, it is confusing to people and it makes decent people tell untruths to the Department of Social **Security**, which results in investigations and increases the overhead costs of administering the means test.

* Opinions may vary on what is an acceptable level of defence spending, bearing in mind the need to allocate resources over a host of Commonwealth agencies, ft does not accord with repeated statements by successive Treasurers and Ministers for Defence that there would be a steady increase in defence spending in the interests of long-term **security**.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Listening to the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr Ruddock),  with his constant talk of eligibility, reminded me of the mealy mouthed language which flows so often from counter clerks in social **security** offices, who are only keen to administer the rules.

* The same kinds of considerations arise in relation to pensioners and other social **security** matters.

* At the moment, of course, there are no rights possessed by anybody but the hope is that this Parliament eventually will create rights for social **security** beneficiaries and if that does happen the enforcement of those rights will become a special area of law.

* -We created social **security** appeals tribunals but this Government has done nothing except take technical points on that also.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The reports of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty cover a wide area and involve many Departments at both Commonwealth and State level as well as local authorities and voluntary agencies.

* Recommendations of the Poverty Commission relating to income **security** have received detailed consideration in my own Department and are currently being examined by the Income **Security** Review Committee in accordance with its terms of reference.

* The International Standards and Recommended Practices concerning **Security**, as agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, deal with broad airport **security** measures and do not specify the.

* The assessment of the number of police required to provide for airport **security** is a matter that is under continuous review.

* The Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales agreed today that there had to be a complete review of **security** arrangements relating to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting.

* Having regard to the discussions among the Heads of Government which are to be held at Bowral, additional **security** precautions have been decided upon.

* Certainly I discussed matters with those people responsible for **security** arrangements on the night of the bombing and very shortly after, and with Premier Wran.

* As Prime Minister of Australia, I had an obligation not only to all Australians, especially those Australians in the vicinity of the Hilton Hotel, but also I had a very particular obligation to 1 1 other Heads of Government and to all the visiting delegations to satisfy myself that those people responsible for **security** were doing everything possible to make sure that no other bomb would be exploded.

* Obviously Premier Wran and I had discussions with those responsible for **security** to achieve that purpose.

* Whether or not this claim is granted depends on a decision of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Data relating to the numbers of Unemployment Benefit recipients are the responsibility of the Department of Social **Security** and, if the honourable member requires any information concerning these, he should direct this question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* ls it also a fact that all members of this Branch will be photographed and screened and that their portraits will be filed in the archives of the Australian  **Security**  Intelligence Organisation to be turned up when the revolution comes?

* In view of the extraordinary nature of the proceedings in the social **security** conspiracy trial involving Greeks, will the Minister seek from the Attorney-General a firm undertaking that the Australian Legal Aid Office will not interfere with the conduct of individual cases by private practitioners to the detriment of the defendants?

* Recently in this House we have heard comments from such people as the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  which have overemphasised the circumstances surrounding living in the urban areas to the complete exclusion of rural and provincial city areas.

* It is time, as we approach the winter recess, when the Government will not have to endeavour in this House to defend the indefensible, to consider the financial **security** of this country.

* The cost during 1972-73 of some of the major expenditure commitments undertaken by the Labor Government include: Increased social **security** pensions, $57m; increased war pensions, $8; defence Services pay, $28m; Aboriginal Advancement Trust, $llm; defence service homes, $5ra; State housing assistance, $6m; and State employment grants, $26m.

* The Labor Party will honour all Australian treaties and alliances which respect the freedom and **security** and the peoples in the treaty areas and their right to determine their own forms of government without external interference.

* No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national **security** or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

* We are inclined to the view - while in no way minimising the importance of guaranteeing **security** to the representatives of foreign powers - that the matter would probably best be dealt with by making it clear (by statutory provision if necessary) that the reasonable apprehension of danger to embassies is a factor to be taken into consideration in the exercise of powers of temporary prohibition and the prescription of routes under the Public Order Act.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) Section 40 ( 1 ) of the Social Services Act provides that a pension shall be paid to the pensioner or, on behalf of the pensioner, to such other person as the pensioner appoints.

* Therefore if a pensioner appoints a warrantee, the Department of Social **Security** has no discretion in the matter, and no guidelines are required.

* Where the appointment is not made by the pensioner, the Depanment of Social **Security** satisfies itself that the proposed warrantee has taken and will continue to take an interest in the welfare of the pensioner.

* The Depanment of Social **Security** reviews warrants if at any time there is reason to believe that the warrant is being abused.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 29 March 1979: 
1 ) What is the number of recipients of social **security** benefits and the amount of those benefits paid by the Department of Social **Security** where the application for benefit followed, or was consequent upon, the dissolution of marriage.

* There was a crucial question to be addressed this year in framing the Defence budget, and it was this: Could we defer some of the defence development provisionally proposed for 1978-79. without there being a serious effect on the **security** which the defence program is designed to afford to the nation now and in the future?

* ls it a fact that a debate on the **security** of the Vietnam task force could not be effectively conducted without revealing troop movements and contingency plans, thus greatly increasing the danger to our troops?

* The Liberal and National Country Parties are committed to the preservation and development of a culturally diversified but socially cohesive Australian society free of racial tensions and offering **security**, well-being and equality of opportunity to all those living here.

* Actively pursue the extension of reciprocal social **security** and similar arrangements with migrant countries.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 14 November 1979: 
1 ) Is it a fact that at the Minister's request, the Department of Social **Security** is conducting a continuing review of the levels of all social **security** benefits and in particular, unemployment benefits.

* Does the **security** check of ministerial staff on which both previous questions have been asked relate to the past financial propriety of the members of that staff?

* Mr Acting Speaker,  let me refer you to the findings not of a party select committee or of any particular party but of  Mr Acting  Justice White in his initial report on Special Branch **Security** Records.

* How do we as a Parliament listening to all this talk about parliamentary privilege and the rights of members contemplate a situation in which all honourable members representing the Government are prepared- and presumably the Prime Minister is prepared- to accept the situation in which they know that every member on this side of the House, and every Labor parliamentarian throughout Australia, has been the subject of a **security** dossier?

* He was written to by the Premier of South Australia who asked the Federal Government to ensure the destruction of any files held by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in regard to innocent people.

* He says that he made it clear in his reply that ASIO would not destroy records and files of actual or potential **security** relevance.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The majority of clients from the office that operated from the Northland Shopping Complex will continue to receive Social **Security** services from the relocated Preston Office.

* I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation whether he is aware that President Nixon recently ordered a tightening of **security** in relation to public accessibility to parked aircraft and the handling of cargo and baggage.

* Will the Minister do everything possible to ensure that our own airlines **security** policy is so designed as to minimise public exposure to the activities of the mentally ill and the criminal?

* They lack flexibility in the undertaking of research and also, of course, there is always a **security** problem with the sort of research which some scientists may desire to undertake in regard to our resources of the sea.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
False allegations have been made by the Minister for the Capital Territory.

* I take it, and I say this in all seriousness, that the Minister had a clearance from the Cabinet to make a statement on **security** at this time, something which normally the Government of the day refuses to do.

* Do I take it that because the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party, came into the House and gave a clearance for this junior Minister to make a statement on **security** that we can expect the Government, at any time when serious allegations have been made, to make a statement about **security**?

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has been blamed for a Watergate-style break-in at the Labor Party 's national headquarters in Canberra just after the 1 975 election.

* **Security** sources in Canberra say ASIO agents entered the premises at night and forced open a filing cabinet crammed with documents from the office of the former Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam.

* I know that individual honourable members can make allegations against governments, against ASIO and against other **security** forces operating in Australia but never has the Labor Party used this subject in the way that the Government is using it now.

* From now on will **security** matters be allowed to be used in politics?

* The Minister for Social **Security**, as I said, wrote to me asking whether I would agree to the publication of documents.

* There is nothing of national **security**.

* It was opened by  Senator Lewis  almost immediately after his swearing in to this Parliament on behalf of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who, at that stage, had responsibility for the Australian Assistance Plan- the scheme under which this office was established.

* In Geelong an officer is working in the immigration area with the Department of Social **Security**.

* When we look at the acceleration in money supply for the latest quarter annualised at 14 per cent, we can rest assured- we can do so with no sense of **security**- that the rate will accelerate further.

* It would give some assurance to the **security** of employment of those who are still engaged in the coalmining industry in the rich Hunter Valley area.

* We will then be able to see the letters that have been written between the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on the arguments about trade training.

* It is because he is locked in a mortal battle with the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Labour could not roll Treasury, the Minister for Social **Security** and the Prime Minister's Department, so that proposal has been abandoned and there will be another way of looking at it.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill 1979 will, together with the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 and the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1979, which have been introduced in, but have not yet passed the Senate, provide the statutory framework for fundamental reforms to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization.

* These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** constituted by  Mr Justice  Hope after a thorough and searching examination of the needs of the nation for a **security** service.

* The legislation was foreshadowed in the statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the House on 25 October 1977 when he outlined in broad terms the Government's decisions to implement reforms affecting the intelligence **security** agencies recommended by  Mr Justice  Hope.

* The legislative reforms themselves are so fundamental and wide ranging that a completely new Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill rather than amendment to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act 1956 has been drafted.

* Mr Justice  Woodward has instituted a rigorous system of internal checks to ensure that the Organization's intelligence collection is geared as closely as possible to the assessed national **security** priorities and therefore that resources are most efficiently deployed.

* The Organization produces regular assessments and reports on national **security** matters and participates with Government departments on a wide range of matters of national **security** interest.

* Honourable members will appreciate that there have been substantial changes to the overall management of the intelligence community following the Prime Minister's statement to the House of 5 May 1977 outlining new intelligence and **security** arrangements in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* Overseeing the functions of officials and constituting a final venue for review and decision is the Intelligence and **Security** Committee of Cabinet composed of key senior Ministers.

* I shall now discuss the terms of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill.

* Mr Justice  Hope pointed out that the justification for the existence of a **security** organization in a democratic country should be reflected in its charter and, in particular, its functions as set out in that charter.

* These recommendations by  His  Honour are reflected in the terms of clause 1 7 of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill which states the functions of the Organization as: 
To obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to **security**.

* For purposes relevant to **security** and not otherwise to communicate any such intelligence.

* To advise Ministers and authorities of the Commonwealth in respect of matters relating to **security**.

* First, recognising the key position of the Director-General and the need for a bi-partisan approach to the **security** of the nation, the Bill will require consultation with the Leader of the Opposition before appointment of the Director-General.

* Additionally, amendments moved by the Government in the Senate require consultation with the Leader of the Opposition before appointment of an acting Director-General- sub-clause 14 (2)- the Director-General to consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of keeping him informed on matters relating to **security**- clause 2 1 -and a copy of the annual report of the Director-General to be given to the Leader of the Opposition- clause 94.

* A further major consideration is the creation in Part IV of the Bill of a totally new statutory framework for the preparation and communication of ASIO **security** assessments in respect of individuals and the giving to most persons affected by prejudicial **security** assessments of a right of appeal to a tribunal presided over by a judge.

* The effect of this Part is that, where a **security** assessment has been made in respect of an employee of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth contractor or, broadly speaking, in respect of a person for the purposes of the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 or the Passports Act 1938, that contains an opinion or information prejudicial to his interests, that person must ordinarily be given notice of the assessment.

* In determining the procedures to be followed by the tribunal, regard has had to be had to the special needs of **security**, particularly preservation of secrecy as to identity of informants.

* The statutory procedures for notification of **security** assessments and for rights of appeal in large part implement the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Hope.

* They represent the first attempt, at least in a common law country, to provide a comprehensive statutory framework regulating the making of **security** assessments of individuals and providing a right of appeal to an independent judicial tribunal.

* Clearly, the Government must, in the ultimate, bear the responsibility for the **security** of the nation.

* It must also bear the responsibility for the general direction of the activities of the **security** organisation.

* At the same time it is proper that the Organisation should be under the control of the Director-General and that the Government should not be able to override the opinion of the Director-General on whether **security** requires or does not require the collection of information on an individual, whether information held concerning an individual should be communicated or on what advice should be given by the Director-General to a Minister or a department.

* However, while we must seek to express in appropriate statutory form the proper relationship between the Government and the DirectorGeneral of **Security**, I must observe that the personal calibre of the holder of that difficult and lonely position will remain of the utmost importance.

* The legislation that I am today introducing represents a balance between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient **security** service and the need to preserve our individual rights and freedoms.

* Australia faces a number of serious threats to its internal **security** including persistent efforts on the part of hostile intelligence agencies to obtain intelligence from within Australia.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 June 1977: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Let every Australian listen to the list that Chou gives of the areas of American aggression.

* First, South Korea, where in 1950 the United Nations **Security** Council declared there was clear aggression by the North against the South.

* That was in January 1950, but in June North Korea invaded the South and right from the beginning Peking declared its support for the aggressors, ls it any wonder that the United States acted quickly both in terms of **Security** Council action and in terms of its own defence?

* It is true that many of these people may now, as a consequence of their loss of real income, to some extent be able to recoup that loss by becoming entitled to Australian social **security** pensions.

* I know that in some instances it is social **security** pension they would receive in Australia.

* At a time when we are showing increasing concern about the relationship of pensions to pre-retirement earnings, we should have some concern about the effect upon this group of persons who perhaps are getting no benefit under reciprocal agreements or under the Australian social **security** system.

* 1 ) Did the use of illegal surveillance at the Australian Embassy in Belgrade constitute the removal of authority from the Ambassador and his effective replacement by an officer of the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation. 
)

* What action was taken to protect the Ambassador and his staff from domination by **security** officers.

* I should have thought that the present arrangements provided **security** for private medical practitioners in Australia.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has always had authority to tap telephones.

* As well as maintaining our traditional alliances I venture to suggest that there is room for many foreign and defence policy initiatives in the southern hemisphere- initiatives designed not only to strengthen our national **security** but also to preserve the **security** of our vital trade routes.

* It is a path of **security** and freedom for all, one that will lead to greater opportunity for all.

* Because of the thrust of change that the Government seeks to bring about I ask: Why the interesting approach in the **Security** Council in June of this year?

* To use one of the Prime Minister's favourite phrases we are, together with Austria, one of the most respectable countries in terms of the **Security** Council so far &lt;as the Middle East dispute is concerned.

* Why were we not playing a role in seeking some accord and an approach towards a solution in the **Security** Council?

* It is a matter of grave disappointment that we did not try to initiate a new solution fair to both sides in the atmosphere of the discussion within the **Security** Council.

* Indeed, rather than placing an emphasis on increased assistance channelled to areas of high unemployment, the Budget has running through it a vindictive strain which would have the Department of Social **Security** expanding its budget, not to provide special assistance for the unemployed but rather to increase the policing of them.

* This is a cognate debate on 3 social **security** Bills.

* The requirements of eligibility for personal care subsidy as they are summarised in the recent annual report of the Department of Social **Security** are simply put this way: 
I take the point of the honourable member for Murray.

* I am aware that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is conscious of this problem.

* Like other social **security** legislation that has been introduced by the Government, the Bill appears to me to be important not only for what it does, but also for what the 
He had a very good base to work from.

* I particularly welcome the view of the Minister for Social **Security** that residents of aged persons homes should have the right to elect representatives on management committees.

* I will not argue again - I think I have it in Hansard on 2 or 3 other occasions - about the insurmountable problems which presently exist when attempts are made by anyone other than the Director-General of Social **Security** to secure detailed financial statements of aged persons homes.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I now touch on that section of the Budget dealing with allocations to the Joint Defence Space Research Facility at Pine Gap.

* No doubt honourable members will have seen recent articles in the Press indicating that it has now been revealed by an American scientist named Phillip Klass, that the Pine Gap establishment is a top **security** United States base which is one of two vital links in a satellite system protecting the United States against a nuclear attack.

* This is difficult to understand as I have no doubt I would have been screened and the screening would have shown that, prior to entering this Parliament, I was Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party and could hardly be called a **security** risk.

* Undoubtedly those people who are aged need **security** of income; undoubtedly those people who are aged need **security** of accommodation; and undoubtedly those people who are aged need **security** in the possibility and actuality of ill health.

* Yet, in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  which dealt with the Nursing Home Assistance Bill and its provisions for deficit financing, the Minister says to the charity nursing homes that the option is entirely theirs- the option to determine whether they will enter this scheme or stay under the present nursing home benefits scheme.

* Faced with this problem, the threatened countries turned to collective **security**, as is permitted under the United Nations Charter.

* Collective **security** not only confers benefits; it also imposes commitments.

* Collective **security** could easily have stopped him early in bis career, but countries which did not feel themselves directly threatened refused to intervene, and the consequence was a world war in which tens of millions died.

* To withdraw our Army from Malaysia and Singapore, despite the firm conviction of those countries that the presence of these troops has a stabilising effect on the area; to eliminate national service, despite the fact that this would cripple the effectiveness of our Army; to pour scorn on the SEATO Treaty, despite the fact that Thailand and the Philippines regard it as a valuable deterrent to external aggression; to emasculate the ANZUS Treaty-the ultimate guarantee of our **security** - by converting it from a military treaty to an economic development agreement; and, finally, the claim that Australia's strategic frontiers are her natural boundaries.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1) It is estimated that at 30 June 1977 there were 14,160 persons in receipt of Social **Security** pensions in the Electoral Division of Kingston.

* The second proviso concerned the character and manner of review of decisions relating to refusal of passports, citizenship and entry and re-entry, where the decision was based on **security** considerations.

* Here, the Department felt that the agreement of the Director-General of **Security** was required and that proper safeguards should be introduced to protect **security** (see paragraph 1 13 et seq of our Interim Report and paragraph 172 below).

* For the potential immigrant overseas, there are issues such as **security** clearances, criminal records and illnesses which might be such that they could not be brought into the open without revealing sources or causing unnecessary embarrassment.

* If the United States does not ratify the SALT II Agreement there will be grave consequences for our **security** and for global stability.

* However, we are at a point when it is essential that we focus our effort on convincing the United States to decide, in its proper constitutional process of Senate ratification of SALT II, to make the choice which enhances our national **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I draw the honourable member's attention to the following statement contained in the second report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** (para 118): 
I have not been able to determine accurately what proportion of adverse and qualified assessments resulted in action prejudicial to the persons the subjects of the assessments because it has not always or uniformly been the practice of employer authorities which receive ASIO's **security** assessments to inform ASIO of the decision they reach after consideration of those assessments.

* I would also draw the honourable member's attention to the statistics on page 133 of the Second Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** and to the footnote on page 46 of that Report.

* ASIO's function in the provision of **security** assessments is advisory only.

* However, I am informed by the Director-General of **Security** that it is unlikely that more than one or two people in the last three years have been rejected for employment in the Australian Public Service or for promotion as the result of an adverse ASIO report.

* With the introduction of new procedures for **security** checking and with the establishment of a **Security** Appeals Tribunal, under legislation shortly to be introduced, accurate records will be available.

* I find it less easy to excuse the deceptive and misleading presentation of these things in the speech made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The Minister for Social **Security** has not said this, but the public had better realise it.

* Is the Minister for Social **Security** aware of the many anxious inquiries being received by honourable members from constituents regarding their position under the hospital provisions of Medibank as from 1 July?

* Worse still, many people in the community during those years sought the **security** of a salaried job in preference to the uncertainty of private enterprise or businesses that were going bankrupt in great numbers.

* However the amendments proposed in the Bill follow the amendments already dealt with in respect of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 (No.

* That was dealt with in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill.

* In all matters of **security**, as the Leader of the Opposition will concede, I see that he has access to information whenever he requests it.

* In matters affecting the nation's **security** it is necessary to move with prudence.

* I wish to stress also the extent to which Australia nowadays and in the future must accept the primary and independent responsibility for safeguarding our **security** and strategic interests.

* The second argument by the Opposition is that the war in the Middle East will affect Australia's **security** because it will disturb the global balance between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on which our **security** basically rests.

* I wish to direct my remarks in the main to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill and the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Bill.

* I want to make it clear that we do not hide the fact that the Chifley Labor Government brought about an Australian **security** organisation.

* The United States asked what type of **security** organisation we had and we had to confess that we had virtually no **security** organisation.

* So that we could be reassured by the United States that it would be forthcoming with modern arms the United States asked us to set up an Australian **security** organisation.

* I am speaking off the cuff, but from memory the Australian **security** organisation was set up under  Mr Justice  Reid.

* When the present Opposition came into power it put the **security** organisation under the control of a military person- I think it was  Colonel Spry-  who was not trained to the same degree as a member of the judiciary in the freedoms and rights of the British people, which applied also to the Australian people.

* During the long period of office of the present Liberal-Country Party Opposition it used the **security** organisation as a political police force.

* If changes had not taken place and the present Opposition had remained in power one could well say the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation was going to follow the same pattern as the American CIA which has brought disgrace to that country all over the world.

* I applaud my Government for taking the effective steps that it has taken in connection with the administration of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and for transferring the responsibility of telephone tapping to the highest man in this land, the Prime Minister.

* A national consultative group on social welfare is being established to advise the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on current issues in social welfare which come within the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government.

* Of course in each State and Territory a small consultative committee on social welfare will be established to advise the Director-General of the Department of Social **Security**, through the appropriate State Director of the Department, on administration at the State level.

* As I understand it, after the Minister for Social **Security** and the Government had studied the report of the Commission the Minister met with her respective State Ministers, had discussions with them about the future of the AAP and suggested that the future administration of the scheme may be better vested in the various State governments and in local government itself.

* It rests on the **security** aspect.

* If the honourable member for Blaxland would compare the **security** report which was presented to the Government in which he served for a period with the **security** report which I tabled in the House yesterday, he must be prepared to concede, despite his obstinacy, that it is like comparing chalk with cheese.

* - Mr Speaker, I come to what is the central argument in this matter; that is, the **security** aspect.

* The **security** people were worried because of knowledge that some Japanese Red Guards were in the vicinity.

* The journalist goes on to say they were told to be at the airport three to four hours before the flight took off to undergo a **security** search.

* The last illustration he gives is that when the Prime Minister visits, say, the United States of America and lands at a commercial airfield, an enormous strain is placed on American **security** resources to implement protective measures at the airport.

* This involves the use of hundreds of **security** personnel, disruption, and inconvenience to other passengers.

* The fact of life today is - 
The Department of Social **Security** regularly receives, from the Commonwealth Employment Service, reports concerning individual claimants for unemployment benefit.

* The headings of discussion in the Conference were: The Enlarged European Community and the Commonwealth', 'World **Security**', 'The Future of Territories in the Commonwealth', 'Commonwealth Immigration Policies', 'Parliamentary Government (in its various aspects)', and 'Economic Problems and Social Problems', the last two being taken in committee session.

* Nevertheless, the delegation did take part in debate on the European Economic Community, World **Security**, the Protection of the Environment, Commonwealth Immigration Policies and the Status and Role of the Parliamentarian in contemporary society.

* Under the heading of 'World **Security**', the Conference welcomed the report from the South Asian members that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh had now seemed to reach a working accommodation, which has led to the easing of tension and created a climate in which the 3 nations on the sub-continent can now work together to fight the problems of want, poverty and development.

* On the other aspect of **security** let us turn to our foreign policy and the question of alliances.

* Whilst it is true that the Australian Government is honouring its policy  pledge  to increase all social **security** pensions twice yearly by payment of $1.50 per week, it is not true for anyone to assert that material improvement has taken place - the continuing and increasing rate of inflation has prevented improvement.

* In fact, the statement made by the Minister for Social **Security** today to the effect that this matter should be considered in the context of the Government's total social **security** program rings a little hollow because tomorrow he will be the Treasurer of Australia and later this year he will prepare a Budget to which he has already committed himself and will honour the commitment and instruction of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to make that Budget a tough one.

* The amendment moved by the Minister states that the Government's total social **security** program should be commended.

* But in February this year the  Chairman  of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in a letter to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said the Commission could not adequately assess the effectiveness of safeguards and **security** measures in countries to which the US sent nuclear materials.

* Like the US, Australia would be handicapped in ensuring the **security** of Australian uranium.

* But this Government has retained the terms of the Memorandum, including specifically the quite unsuitable control provisions of the Atomic Energy Act; and it has widened the areas in which regulations involving **security** can be made.

* These **security** provisions are quite irrelevant to a commercial operation unless they involve those parts of the fuel cycle which deal with plutonium or enriched uranium, that is, those parts of the fuel cycle which might be targets for terrorists.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** aware that the means test for eligibility to receive the benefits of the pensioner medical service and other ancillary benefits has not altered since 1960?

* It is because most of us have the lynch mob mentality of people with jobs, **security** and a good deal of privilege.

* 1 was quite clear that the Minister was deliberately saying that certain people who write in newspapers and certain members of the Opposition had raised this matter and were asking questions about it for the purpose of undermining **security**.

* It means, I think, specifically that those members of the Opposition who have asked questions about this matter have been doing so to undermine the **security** of Australia.

* Working to undermine **security**' is a common expression that has been used.

* The Australian people are entitled to expect a Budget which enshrines the principles of economic **security**, education opportunities, equality through social welfare, **security** of employment, and wage and income levels commensurate with skill.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
and (2) My Department's IYC Unit was advised of the program proposed for the Festival, including the IYC segment and listed the event, along with many hundreds of events and projects in the July 1979 'Catalogue of National Events and Projects in Australia'.

* While the IYC Unit has undertaken the gathering of the information contained in the catalogue, it in no way reflects the attitude of the Department of Social **Security** to these projects, nor does the Department carry any responsibility for the nature or viability of projects listed.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said, this Bill consolidates and extends- to my view it extends very considerably- the help we are giving to these centres.

* In accordance with the practice of successive Governments I do not propose to comment on any **security** measures which may have been adopted as a result of the visit of this Group.

* 425 of the **Security** Council referred to by the honourable member called for, among other things, strict respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognised boundaries.

* I have indicated to him in those discussions, and would confirm now, that the Government regarded Resolution 425 as a worthwhile outcome of the **Security** Council's debate on this very serious situation which had developed, and considered the establishment of UNIFIL, to which the honourable member referred, to be a positive step.

* UNIFIL 's task, of course, will be an extremely difficult one, but we nevertheless trust it will be able to pave the way for the early restoration in southern Lebanon of the authority of the Lebanese Government, and for the normality and **security** which the people of southern Lebanon have awaited for so long.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 19 April 1977: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 7 March 1978: 
1 ) How many persons who, after receiving unemployment benefits, had those benefits terminated on the grounds that they were ineligible or received other social **security** benefits during (a) 1976 and (b) 1977.

* I will not detain the Committee for long, although I believe that what I am to say is, if not in itself tremendously important, at least deals with the most important subject before this Parliament, namely, the **security** of the Australian people.

* I do not believe that this **security** can in the long run be differentiated entirely from the **security** of the other peoples of the world.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Government would like to see a secure and lasting peace established in the Middle East and hopes that at the forthcoming examination by the **Security** Council of the situation there all parties will take the opportunity to direct their efforts to arriving at a peaceful settlement as soon as possible.

* The Government will certainly be concerned during their deliberations to adopt a balanced and constructive approach to the issue: however, it believes any efforts by the **Security** Council and its members to achieve some progress towards a settlement on the occasion can only be useful if, as the Secretary-General has observed in his current review of the situation in the region, the parties concerned are prepared to avail themselves of these efforts and to work for some agreement between each other.

* We do not have in mind an independent Australian initiative at the forthcoming meeting of the **Security** Council.

* 1 ) Has the Attorney-General 's Department been notified  by the Department of Social **Security** of any submissions from the Victorian Council for Handicapped Readers regarding provisions of the Copyright Act and the reproduction of literature and dramatic works for the blind and disabled without infringing copyright; if so, what action does the Government propose to take on this matter?

* Certain people both inside and outside this House ask why there should be any **security** at all there.

* The result of this questioning is constant attempts to penetrate **security** at Pine Gap by sections of the media and certain honourable members opposite.

* The **security** of this country is helped by its research programme.

* Such action could only help to reveal details of the highest national **security**.

* I will refer the other details of the question to the Minister for Social **Security** in another place.

* In the absence of a unilateral decision on the part of that Government to make its pensions available to Australian residents who are not German nationals, the pensions could be paid in Australia if an appropriate reciprocal arrangement on social **security** were concluded between the two 
Governments.

* The general question of Australian participation in reciprocal arrangements on social **security** agreements with other countries, including West Germany, is one to which the Australian Government is presently giving very serious and urgent consideration.

* What **security** measures are in force in the transport of the enriched fuel.

* What measures does the Government take to ensure that workers involved in the transport of enriched fuel and the general public are (a) provided with adequate **security** and (b) not exposed to health risks.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-I ask the Treasurer: Why has the Government found it necessary to tax payments made to such people as rehabilitees, people in sheltered employment, and people receiving tuberculosis allowances, including housekeeper allowances?

* Has the Treasurer, in consultation with the Minister for Social **Security**, discussed the possible additional costs to be borne by the Government as a result of a likely increase in the institutionalisation of the handicapped flowing from the Government's decision?

* As this House will be aware the particular situations of my Department and of the Department of Social **Security** have been kept under constant review and adjustments to ceilings have been made periodically following the several reviews which have taken place.

* In addition, special arrangements have been made between the Department of Social **Security** and the Public Service Board to ensure that emerging staff problems are monitored and attended to promptly.

* For example, the staff of the Department of Social **Security** grew by almost 900 during 1976-77 largely as a result of changes to ceilings as the work load in the Department grew.

* As I have mentioned, there were the substantial increases in the Department of Social **Security** and my own Department.

* (Oxley- Minister for Social **Security**) -  Mr Speaker,  I draw the attention of honourable members- 
However, **security** relating to new naval construction is a matter of concern, as I said recently, because ali reports indicate that there are in the Dockyard a number of men whose allegiance would be to the Communist Party as well as to this country.

* The guarantee will be subject to appropriate **security** arrangements approved by the Treasurer.

* The Australian Labor Party believes that maternity leave is a basic element of a woman's right to work, her job **security** and her ability to compete on equal terms in the work force.

* By the end of World War II all European countries had introduced basic rights to maternity leave benefits and employment **security**.

* For example, in Belgium maternity leave of six weeks before the expected date of birth and eight weeks after the actual confinement may be taken by any worker; a manual worker receives full pay from her employer for one week and social **security** benefits amounting to 80 per cent of earnings for the remaining 13 weeks of leave; and a non-manual worker receives full pay from her employer for one month and social **security** benefits for the remainder of the leave period.

* In France maternity leave of six weeks before the expected date of birth and 10 weeks after confinement may be taken by any worker; and workers may claim social **security** benefits amounting to 90 per cent of normal earnings.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
In what countries are Australian social **security** benefits at present being paid.

* We must not be lulled into a sense of false **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
This Bill represents a very welcome change from the historical attitude of Liberal Party and like-minded governments to the problem of crime.

* I am sure will be a very good investment in the future **security** of Australia, the **security** of our children and a better investment than the expenditure of lives and money in a futile war, such as the one in Vietnam.

* I pointed out the other day that there are nearly 800,000 recipients of social **security** benefits who will no longer be able to benefit from bulk billing.

* In addition to persons who are actually receiving social **security** benefits, other people who are poor and who are sick, intermittently ill, sometimes with chronically ill children, are in receipt of very low incomes.

* The Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  represents the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in this House and he must be aware of the potential extra cost involved in moving people from the health field into the social **security** field.

* It seems to me quite remarkable that having appointed such a person and such a secretariat this Government then introduces legislation which, from the point of view of the Government and the Department of Health, at best will shift costs from the Department of Health to the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 

 Mr SINCLAIR (New England- Minister for Shipping and Transport) (.I.IK a.m.] - Without going into clause 8 and the earlier provisions of the Bill (et me assure the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Jess)  that in terms of this proposition the SI 00m will not be invested until such time as the provisions of clause 24, setting out when and under what circumstances the second $50m will be available, are met.

* In any event there is a specific requirement that only that part of the Corporation's borrowings which are attracted in terms of the **security** as a result of this ultimate SI 00m will be used for the purposes of the Corporation.

* Department of Social **Security**: Mobile Office in Country Areas  (Question No.

* 1924) 
The Opposition invites the Government to compare standards of disposable income, **security**, housing, food costs and the like of Australian families now with what they were in December 1975.

* If that is the case, we ought to ask ourselves, firstly, this very simple question: What is the greatest destroyer of living standards, job **security**, personal **security** and family **security** of Australians?

* Nothing so undermines the **security** of a family, the sense of wellbeing of a family and the sense of togetherness of a family and gives it a greater sense of desperation than a spiralling level of inflation.

* The fourth on the list of the Ministry is the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* All one needs to do is to cite the deplorable Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation exercise to recall how this man, in an endeavour to protect his colleagues in the left of his Party, was prepared to breach every area of ministerial responsibility by taking one of the groups responsible to him - the Commonwealth Police Force - into the offices of another, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, in order to pursue what I suspect was only a personal vendetta.

* I believe it is deplorable that in such a direct and irresponsible action this man could so have disrupted the **security** capacity of this country.

* The number of 1,458 assignments given **security**, increased efficiency and volume of production makes it unique in the State lo dale in the ratio of farms served lo capital cost.

* I wish to refer briefly to a few of the benefits that will be derived from this scheme, with **security** of production as a result of irrigation.

* Its purpose was to root out subversion within the community and to protect the **security** of the country.

* More than half the 36 adult Aborigines resident at present on the Lake Tyers property are living on social **security** payments or waiting for approval as social **security** beneficiaries.

* The aspirations, determination and self-respect of the Aborigines of Lake Tyers, no less than the health of Aboriginal children throughout East Gippsland- 
The predicament of Lake Tyers is symbolised by the 3 Chairmen who have held office within a 2-year period and had their spirits broken in doing so, by the management committee members who have resigned their positions and the shareholders who have gone away or who now rely on the Department of Social **Security** for their incomes and upon alcohol as a substitute for self-respect.

* Finally, let me say something of the implication for Australian **security** of the current war.

* Australia has contributed towards the maintenance of **security** in South Vietnam and continues to give help in the way of economic assistance, defence aid and training.

* Australian **security** is best promoted if, drawing on increasingly self-reliant military strength, we continue to recognise and support the **security** interests which we share with those who are part of our special strategic environment.

* -Does the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** recall the election promises in 1975 and 1977 that the real value of pensions will be preserved ' and that 'the politics have been taken out of pension increases by linking them automatically with the consumer price index'?

* I do not believe that even in a small matter like this - it is a symbolic matter and perhaps many people would say it is not small - our policy should be directed to the real **security** of the Australian nation in circumstances which may not be entirely safe or entirely secure.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The types of problems that I see for the industry are that, if we accept that the 2 Japanese firms are to come into the industry and if we accept that economic viability or an ability to compete in the market place is based on production runs, then we must also accept that S firms cannot operate within the market that exists.

* The plans now before us constitute a drop in **security**, if such is possible, for people in the industry in my area and in South Australia because of some changes which have taken place.

* Our social welfare policy and approach seek to enhance the **security**, dignity and self-reliance of each individual.

* More money will alleviate the stress on these families, provide greater **security**, and increase the families' choices in the way they organise their lives.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has announced that the Government is agreeable to funding the staffing and administrative costs of the 37 Regional Councils for Social Development which have been funded during the pilot phase of the Australian Assistance Plan for a maximum period of 12 months from 1 July  1976,'  which involves a maximum commitment of $3m for the year 1976-77.

* I understand that officers of the Department of Social **Security** during this transition period of one year will be available to assist with the transfer of the Plan to the States.

* The aged who have saved and invested during their working life to ensure that they will not have to depend entirely on social **security** payments find the tax man reaping his share, after they have been taxed all the way through their working lives.

* The fundamental aim of any social **security** scheme should be to raise the individual to a level at which he can help himself.

* The Government is doing this by a unique device of stimulating voluntary insurance by government aid which tremendously increases the value of the premium in medical **security**.

* For the information of honourable members I present an interim statement on the activities of the Department of Social **Security** for 1 978-79.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
 Foreign policy is an integral part of the total national policy of all countries and will be seen as serving that country's own national interest.

* Foreign policy must serve the interests and promote the welfare and **security** of the Australian people.

* These were first, our own national **security**; secondly, a secure, united and friendly Papua New Guinea; thirdly, achieve closer relations with our nearest and largest neighbour, Indonesia; fourthly, promote the peace and prosperity of our neighbourhood.

* Instead, our national **security** is jeopardised.

* Mr Speaker,  I seek leave to make a short statement about one part of the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* In responding to this motion I first thank the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for his courtesy in allowing me to look at these reports last evening and also for the great pleasure of joining him at dinner and meeting the charming, intelligent  chairman  of the Commission.

* (Extension of time granted) I thank the Minister for Social **Security** and the House.

* But over the last fortnight the Australian Labor Party has been asking me, the Army, the Minister for Defence  (Mr Fairbairn)  and, indeed the Government as a whole, to disclose not only the dates of the return of 3 and 4 Battalions but also the disposition of our own forces, enemy forces, movements into the province and all the information that would jeopardise the **security** of our Task Force in South Vietnam.

* Yet the very topic we are discussing is 'the **security** of the Task Force'.

* It cannot demand information and also talk of the need for proper and adequate **security**.

* As ( said, it is, in itself, an attack on the **security** of the Task Force if the Government is to be charged with the responsibility of giving the details requested by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in his speech.

* The main basis of the planning of this withdrawal is, in fact, the **security** of the force and the Government will not, in any way, be moved by the remarks of members of the Opposition to give the sort of telegraphing of which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has spoken.

* Members of the Opposition have spoken of the **security** of our Task Force and have suggested that the phased withdrawal prejudices **security**.

* All these and other matters have been carefully considered - particularly the **security** of our forces - and this has resulted in a thoroughly workmanlike plan which anticipates that the bulk of our troops in Vietnam will be home by the end of the year.

* The recent operation was not 'needless or pointless' as the Opposition has stated but was necessary and proper to ensure the **security** of the province and the continuance of the Army's duty to carry out its allotted task.

* The Opposition knows as well as I do that such patrols are absolutely essential to the **security** of our own forces.

* It has been evident that the degree of **security** has fluctuated over the years.

* Yes, heavyweight **security**.

* Pensioners and other social **security** beneficiaries now know the exact extent to which their incomes would be reduced in the unlikely event of the Opposition being in a position to give effect to its theories.

* Social **security** payments, low cost housing, housing loans- 
Honourable gentlemen should address their minds to the amount that will have to be slashed from the expenditure of each department to meet that colossal reduction in overall government spending.

* Let the pensioners and social **security** beneficiaries of this country ask themselves what level of pension could be paid in the face of a reduction of the Estimates by one-eighth.

* It is evident that the Indonesian authorities have launched a number of development projects, although some of them seem to be more related to military and **security** needs than to the immediate needs of the people.

* It notes that the population of 688,771, which was recorded by the Diocese of Dili in 1974 had declined to 329,271 at the end of 1978, based on an assessment completed at that time by the Indonesian Defence and **Security** Authorities responsible for East Timor.

* There have been some six separate accounts of bizarre executions of captured Fretilin leaders, possibly including Alarico Fernandes, the former Fretilin Minister for Information and Internal **Security**, who surrendered to the Indonesians some 1 2 months ago.

* So it was not any fault of the Department of Social **Security** that the total vote was not expended.

* Can the Minister tell the House whether the Government of South Vietnam has indicated what measures it intends to employ to ensure the continuance of **security** in the area that we are vacating?

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Of the four organs of the United Nations- The General Assembly, The **Security** Council, The Trusteeship Council, and the Economic and Social Council, only two, the General Assembly and the Trusteeship Council, passed resolutions in 1971 on Papua New Guinea.

* After receiving inquiries from dismissed workers, my office made the normal check with the Department of Social **Security** and was informed that as the workers had contributed to their dismissal unemployment benefit would not be available.

* The local Social **Security** office informed my office that the decision would have to be ratified by Sydney or Canberra.

* There followed a series of accusations that the management had engineered the strike in order to close the works and ultimately the Department of Social **Security** declared that unemployment benefit would be available.

* I had already announced my intention to have the whole matter determined by the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal in view of the confused situation and in view of representations to me by former employees who had been on recreation leave, on sick leave, on night shift and in other situations and who were denied benefits.

* I do not think the **security** of Australia or a situation where, as you know,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  as I know and as the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  and others in this House know, we have Australian troops still at war with troops dying in the field is a fit subject for ridicule.

* The Government has made it quite clear in the statement of the Minister for Defence that Australia is not going to retreat into isolation, that Australia realises that it lives in this region of the world and that within our limited capacity, as far as we can, we will stand up to support our allies and play our part in the defence of the **security** of this region.

* Without that **security** what is the use of economic aid and helping people to raise their standards of living and everything that goes with it?

* Anybody who has been in that position takes no delight in asking the younger generation of Australians today to go forth once again, unfortunately, in the interests of the **security** of Australia and our allies.

* If we have a job to do in the interests of the **security** of our nation everybody has the duty as well as the right to play his part.

* Many of these tenants are reliant upon Commonwealth social **security** and welfare payments and, indeed, are in need of assistance in providing a home for their families.

* Australia will use its best endeavours to ensure the continuing **security** of the Loan and the smooth devolution of responsibility with respect thereto.

* The Minister for Social **Security** will remember frequent submissions I have made to him recently about many proposals put forward in the interim report of the committee of inquiry into aged persons housing which was tabled in this Parliament last year.

* Interest rates paid by borrowers tend to vary in relation to term, credit ratings, sources of finance, **security**, etc The following yields represent no more than a broad guide to interest rate levels in each market: 
My question is directed to the Minister for Defence.

* Can the Minister inform the House as to the present and future operations of this important organisation, particularly as they affect the **security** and employment opportunities of all employees?

* To many individuals, the possession of money connotes more than the realistic, practical use that the rational man ascribes to it; it symbolises not only economic, but social and emotional, **security**.

* All of these important things arise when a person's economic **security** is attacked in this vicious and unjustified way for which this Government is responsible.

* An article in the 'Financial Review' of 29th December pointed out that according to SO per cent or more employers, the following occupations are in a glut: Administrative work (women); agricultural economics; agricultural science; articled  clerks  (law); biometry, data processing (without computer training in course); economic research; editorial work: geography; journalism; market research; marketing (general); psychology; stockbroking and **security** analyses.

* Can the Minister say when the New Zealand high **security** animal quarantine station on Somes Island In Wellington Harbour will be in operation.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 August 1978: 
-There are a few matters in these estimates for the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that should concern all honourable members.

* For example, it is disturbing to note in the Estimates that an amount of $55,000 has been allocated for the current year on top of the $ 178,000 which was expended last year on compensation for business affected by **security** arrangements.

* It concerns me, when I look at these estimates and recall another incident that occurred in the chamber this afternoon, that the **security** arrangements clearly are inadequate.

* I must express my concern that the sorts of **security** arrangements that exist in overseas parliaments do not appear to have been extended to our Parliament.

* In that context, I am concerned that there appears to be a great degree of resistance to the proposition that members of Parliament should co-operate with the **security** arrangements made in terms of passes and so on.

* -I wish to raise the question of children's services in this debate, as they were outlined in the appropriations for the Department of Social **Security**.

* I have music for the Minister's ears because not only is the Opposition going to support these 3 Bills but it is going to commend the Government and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for the reforms that have been included in the Bills.

* These announcements were made following a report presented by a working party of officers of the Department of Social **Security** and the Treasury.

* Surely the whole thrust of a social **security** program should be to keep people as they are aging out of institutions, whether they be run by the State, whether they be run by the Government, or whether they be run by somebody else.

* We face the hazard of potential electronic bugging of the telephone by courtesy of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I think it is important that, if we are to have physical **security** in the building, there ought also to be reasonable **security** about what we say and do within the building.

* Something ought to be done to ensure reasonable **security** for members.

* The Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  is left out, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  is left out, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  is left out.

* None of them shares the Minister's sanguine view about the future **security** of the South East Asian region.

* The countries in the region believe that this Government is isolationist and unwilling to play a role as a partner in preserving the **security** of the region.

* I wish to stress ... the extent to which Australia nowadays and in the future must accept the primary and independent responsibility for safeguarding our **security** and strategic interests.

* The average householder is satisfied to enjoy the use value of his land and ' the **security** it offers and,- in general, he cares little for its exchange value.

* While the **security** of Australia has never rested solely upon the American alliance, that alliance remains a key element in it.

* And whatever the outcome of the events now unfolding in Vietnam, the basic elements of Australia's **security** remain untouched.

* Who rules in Saigon is not, and never has been, an ingredient in Australia's **security**.

* Our strength, our **security**, rest on factors and relationships ultimately unchanged by these events.

* Above all, Australia's **security**, as with the peace of the world, rests ultimately upon making the detente between the United States and the Soviet Union a success and upon associating China in a wider detente.

* These are the great relationships and the great factors which determine the **security** of Australia.

* This is one of the reasons why we were there, as well as indirectly assisting the long term Interests of Australian **security** and the **security** of the people of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia as well.

* As the Prime Minister recently reminded the House the Government looks to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to provide timely advice on all matters which might affect the **security** of this country, including improper activities by any foreign intelligence service in Australia.

* In the 1973-74 Budget the former Government announced that all pensions paid under the social **security** legislation to people of pensionable age would be subject to tax.

* The Teaching Service is intended to provide continuity of service and **security** Ibr teachers working in Commonwealth schools, to facilitate movement between mainland Commonwealth school systems, and to provide a base service for selected teachers in Papua New Guinea.

* Therefore, I draw your attention to page 98 of Hansard, the second column, wherein the Minister for Social **Security** made a remark to me which was grossly offensive and which I asked to be considered offensive.

* I therefore ask that you require the Minister for Social **Security** to withdraw his offensive remark.

* If the Minister for Social **Security** does not feel impelled to offer an apology then I have nothing further to say.

* However, this Repatriation Bill, like the social **security** Bill presented previously which it follows closely, has a few hidden and very nasty surprises.

* The honourable member for Barton  (Mr Reynolds)  mentioned that the Government was carrying out the same actions in this Repatriation Bill as in the social **security** Bill, but that is not quite as good an operation as he might think.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 November 1978: 
1) Is the Department of Social **Security** providing funds for the construction of home units for old persons in Francis Street, Yea, Victoria.

* The House condemns the Budget because (a)  lt  breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for  1971-72 a  fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**'.

* The primary duty laid on this Australian Parliament is the duty of ensuring Australia's **security**.

* Already the **security** which we thought we had on our northern frontiers seems to be vanishing.

* Is there any real **security** for Australia in believing that the communist forces- 
I want the House, if it thinks that there is some **security** in this changing of sides, to look at what happened in Europe last month at the so-called Conference on **Security** and Co-operation which was held in Helsinki.

* I was recently in the United States of America where, I discovered, social **security** payments are now adjusted on that basis each year.

* With these requirements in mind, the Australian Labor Party has pledged itself to undertake a wide ranging social welfare programme, not only aimed at rooting out poverty but also aimed at progressively removing the very real disadvantages of social discrimination and at establishing economic **security** for all in ill health, unemployment, invalidity, widowhood and age.

* On the one hand Labor will set about establishing a meaningful system of social **security**.

* The comprehensive social **security** approach will also include universal health insurance.

* Let me develop some aspects of Labor's social **security** goals.

* If the honourable member for Oxley had read the  Sydney Morning Herald  on 3 May he would have seen the commitment by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to the acceleration of the development of government supported aged housing to overcome the huge backlog.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has been in discussion with her State colleague in Victoria, the Honourable Brian Dixon, and the Victorian Government has also decided to contribute $50,000 for the same purpose.

* The Commonwealth Department of Social **Security** is working with the State department to determine the distribution of those funds for people in necessitous circumstances as a result of the deplorable strike in Victoria.

* At least if developers are to be allowed to develop land after they have accepted money on it, a government could give more stable guarantees and **security** to purchasers.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  ( 1), (2), (3) and (4) I am advised by the National Capital Development Commission that various surveys and investigations of the structural condition, internal layout and **security** of the present Parliament House have been carried out by the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of Construction in the past The results of the most recent investigations of accommodation in the present building and alterations to improve **security** will now need to be reviewed in the light of the Government's decision to proceed with the design and construction of a new Parliament House and to restrain expenditure of funds on the present building.

* -I call the Minister for Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 March 1979: 
1 ) Has the Department of Social **Security** denied unemployment benefits to 173 persons mentioned by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs in the House of Representatives on 28 February 1979  (Hansard,  page 433), for their failure of the work test.

* I am a little disappointed about the answer that the Minister gave to me, although in the end he did say that he would discuss the matter with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I admit that the law as far as social **security** is concerned stands at exactly the same point at this present moment as it was under the previous Government of my political persuasion, but the point that I endeavoured to make this afternoon is that the primary producer at the moment is facing an extremely difficult situation.

* Minister for Social **Security**, because I know that it also comes into his portfolio, to look into this matter was that I have 3 instances in my area where the primary producer- the man- may have to leave the district to go to Sydney to find employment.

* But quite seriously, I should like the Minister to look at this matter to see whether in conjunction with the Minister for Social **Security** something cannot be done to help these people in the particular circumstances and difficulties which they face at the present time.

* At no time were the adopted given names of the children notified to the Department of Social **Security** for child endowment purposes.

* I regret any instance of distress caused to the family but, on the other hand, if the family had advised the child endowment section of the Department of Social **Security** of the change of name, prompt action could have been taken to change the records.

* The establishment by the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Labor and Immigration of offices on the eastern shore of the Derwent have assisted thousands of people.

* Let us have a quick look at the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The Government has an expenditure review committee- I call it the Big Five, the super brains of the Cabinet- of which the Minister for Social **Security** is a member.

* I say to the Minister for Social **Security**: 'Why not scrap this Bill altogether and extend the existing service?'

* The Minister for Social **Security** refers to it as being a free scheme.

* Unfortunately the experience of democratic societies of **security** organisations has not been good.

* Let us look at the Central Intelligence Agency in America, the kindred body of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The tapping of telephone lines, the installation of microphones, the creation of a vast body of **security** police- all these things are commonplace.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The Department of Social **Security**, in conjunction with the Australian Telecommunications Commission is reviewing the eligibility of fringe benefit pensioners who receive the Telephone Rental Concession.

* , (4) and (5) It is the responsibility of the Department of Social **Security** to ensure that benefits paid under the Social Services Act and concessions granted by the Commonwealth are received only by those persons who are legally entitled to receive them.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Labor will update the income tests for social **security** payments and fringe benefits in line with inflation.

* It has already been admitted by the Department of Social **Security** that there are no administrative difficulties in correcting these anomalies that 
That is certainly a more explicit commitment.

* Again, during the election in December 1977, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said in an advertisement publicised throughout this country: 
-No, even better than that, the excuse was the Government's success on the inflation front.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said: 
I would like sincerely to congratulate the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  and the Government on the White Paper.

* I have some understanding of the constraints under which such a paper is written- **security**, of course, being one great problem.

* Because of the vital importance of the **security** of the nation and the immense cost of effective defence, it is of the first importance that the national aims and objectives should be stated clearly and simply.

* Yet this alliance, however strong it may be, must not lull us into a sense of false **security**.

* This was a tragedy and a great national loss because the loss of family **security** and cover could mean financial hardship for thousands of families should a breadwinner suddenly die.

* By joining a common pool of people concerned about the same issues, a person can provide for himself or herself and for dependants, financial **security** which would otherwise be impossible to attain.

* Second, the clear failure of existing social and economic structures to meet the needs of modern society, particularly in relation to education, social **security**, health, industrial relations and urban and regional development.

* Legislation will be introduced to provide for self-government on 1st December 1973, or as soon as practicable therafter In providing for the transfer of further powers and functions to the House of Assembly, including control of the Public Service of Papua New Guinea, my Government will legislate to protect employment **security** of overseas officers who were appointed by the Australian Government.

* My Government has already announced, in accordance with its election program, a wide- ranging series of measures to improve Australia's social **security** system.

* It will propose a number of measures by which: the means test will be ended during the current Parliament; all Australians entitled to social **security** payments may receive them wherever they choose to live without the need for reciprocal agreements with other countries; and by which there will be twice-yearly increases of $1.50 each in the basic rate of pensions until they reach 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
Has his attention been drawn to a report in "The Australian' of 7th April 1971 that a Government spokesman said after question time the previous day that the Prime Minister had given a very high **security** classification to the communication received through the British Government on the sale of Australian wheat to China?

* In the area of social **security**, health and welfare, this socially irresponsible ad hoc decision making is most pronounced.

* The decision to means test family allowances was in direct contradiction of the assurance given by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* I believe that the recently announced reversal of policy may mark a victory for the Minister for Social **Security** and will be a very serious setback for the Prime Minister whose credibility is running out at an unprecedented rate.

* I do not propose for one moment to trace all the labyrinth of the Opposition's statements in the debate this morning but only to refer the Opposition to the last page of the statement I made to this Parliament where I made it plain that the facts of that statement had been checked with the relevant permanent heads, namely, the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board and the permanent heads of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Trade and Resources, the Department of Defence, the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of Finance and the Australian Statistician.

* We have the circumstance in which the present Leader of the Opposition, as Minister for Social **Security**, knew perfectly well that an improper course had been followed- he said so himself; he repeated it today- in May 1973.

* If it was to be a technical evaluation in Canada of IBM equipment, how were people in the Department of Social **Security** to find out about the equipment without someone from IBM being there to advise them at that time?

* Indeed, on the one hand, the Leader of the Opposition is still seeking - 
The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Education are now working closely together and we must hope that they will find solutions.

* In the United Nations **Security** Council the power of veto is in the hands of the British, the French, the United States, the USSR and China.

* I believe that there is more **security** in democratic nations than in undemocratic nations.

* I sat in on the **Security** Council debate a few weeks ago when the Kampuchea and Vietnam fracas was discussed.

* As Minister for Health for a period in charge of quarantine matters, I was privileged to initiate some moves to prepare for an eventuallity such as the outbreak of bluetongue by the provision of animal virus laboratories, high **security** virus laboratories and on off-shore animal quarantine station and so on.

* As the virus is now already in Australia, will this obviate a lot of the very costly high **security** provisions that were contemplated before the virus got here?

* If we were not sure that the virus was already here and we were testing potentially infected specimens either from within Australia or from the forthcoming off-shore quarantine station, we would require very high **security** measures to prevent the spread of the virus into the rest of the community.

* As the Government's case seems to be based on the fact that, for **security** purposes, the Prime Minister needs his own aircraft to travel overseas I ask the Minister: What was the purpose of the decision of the Prime Minister to buy two of the aircraft?

* One thing one has to remark is that this is in complete contrast to the very real concern expressed by an apparently less influential Minister, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in the Senate last week.

* The Minister commented blithely that numbers had increased during the past year in the Departments of Social **Security** and Employment and Industrial Relations.

* I ask honourable members to imagine the distress of counter staff in the Commonwealth Employment Service, in the Department of Social **Security**, who, because of understaffing, are faced with many more clients than they are able to deal with.

* This has resulted from the provisional antidumping action by the Commonwealth Government in the form of **security** deposits, pending the outcome of the Tariff Board inquiry into the dumping of cheese onto the Australian market.

* By the action taken by the Opposition in the House of Representatives, the **security** of a basic grant to every child attending a non-government school is preserved.

* Those people who are lucky enough to find a job are unable to look to the future for the hope of **security** of employment.

* The August figures for unemployment mean only that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  is wielding the axe in her Department in order to ease the embarrassment of the disastrous record of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  and the Fraser Government generally.

* This Department has introduced deliberately narrow requirements for identification of those people seeking social **security** benefits.

* I am sure that no honourable member who keeps in touch with his electorate office would deny that problems related to petty bureaucratic nit-picking in the Department of Social **Security** emerge frequently in the daily routine of electorate staff as they help to untangle bureaucratic tape and humbug.

* -Briefly, I would like the indulgence of the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  to make it perfectly clear that whilst the Opposition can in no way oppose the altered administrative arrangements under the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation legislation, in the event of a change of government it is the intention of a Liberal-National Country Party government to reverse this Government's decision and to return administrative control of ASIO to the Attorney-General, for reasons that were adequately canvassed during the course of the debate.

* This is similar to provisions in other legislation administered by the Department of Social **Security** and corresponds with an equivalent provision in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Bill 1974.

* Many of the men and women who will benefit from the improved services for the homeless are now receiving income **security** benefits at rates and under conditions which, in accordance with the Government's enlightened and progressive policy, have been liberalised dramatically since the end of 1972.

* The Ontario Health Minister - the man who will be running the scheme, the equivalent of our Minister for Social **Security** - is quoted as having said about the scheme: It is up to the politicians to reform the monster before it bankrupts the economy and destroys itself.

* There is an interesting question on the notice paper in which I asked the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to tell me just who are uninsured.

* After we saw the Green Paper, we had a succession of statements by the Minister for Social **Security** saying what he would not do in relation to what was contained in the Green Paper.

* If they were alive today they would have been handed SOc a week each extra for 1970-71 in this Australia that they both fought to build in war and in peace, this Australia of the mineral boom of Hamersley and Gove, and today of uranium in the Northern Territory: this Australia of record growth rates, of **security** and peace which is the envy of the world.

* What  1  refuse to accept is that workers in a particular field, such as miners at Mount Isa or drillers at Kambalda, should feel that they have exclusive rights to bonuses for success and that the benefits should not go also to the teacher who trains their children, the policeman who guards their **security**, the postman who delivers their mail and, if you like, the income tax clerk who assesses their two returns.

* The first is the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  who is culpable to the Australian nation for not advising this Parliament and the Australian people of what steps have been taken to determine the size, structure and role of the Papua New Guinea defence forces during this period of self-government prior to independence when I would remind honourable members that we are still internationally responsible and answerable to the United Nations for matters of internal **security** but particularly of defence **security**.

* It could be called upon if the Chief Minister and his Ministers raters decided there was a need to use it in circumstances of internal **security** matters or as an aid to the civil power of the police.

* My personal view, as was known, was that the boundary ought to be moved, but moved in a way that would not disrupt the lives of the people of the Torres Strait Islands and would give them **security** in the future.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
It is no use the honourable member interjecting while he is out of his seat.

* It is because the Government regards migrants as people who ought to be treated in a sub-standard manner with regard  to  social **security** and other conditions.

* Perhaps such umpire could be an officer of the Department of Social **Security**.

* An injured worker receiving such payments is also entitled to apply for social **security** sickness benefit but commonly there is no entitlement or only partial entitlement to receive such benefitas distinct from applying for it- because the rate of workers compensation payment is too high.

* As I have mentioned, this is because the Department of Social **Security** still takes into account the full amount of his lump sum payment, averaging it out as if it were still being paid in weekly or fortnightly instalments.

* I repeat that I do not raise this issue to argue against the policy of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I want to discuss a matter that is of major importance not only to the **security** of Australia but to the **security** of all nations.

* They believe that they cannot reasonably be expected to stop their nuclear testing while nothing is done to reduce the nuclear capacity of the Soviet Union - which is their next door neighbour and which they believe is threatening their **security** - and of the United States.

* There is nothing more certain than that in the ultimate analysis the Australian people alone will be responsible for the safety and **security** of our land.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
It would not be appropriate, for **security** reasons, to make information about any steps taken by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to reduce losses through fraud publicly available.

* That on December 10, 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* Thus approximately 60 per cent of total outlays are involved in carrying out programs in the Departments of Defence, Health, Education and Social **Security**.

* There may be some scope for further expenditure cuts, but I submit that these will be minor in relation to overall expenditure growth which will rise substantially due to inflation, continuing programs in the major portfolios and wage and social **security** indexation.

* Australia is obliged by a **Security** Council resolution of 27 May last to close down the Rhodesia Information Centre in Australia.

* The deadline is the 1 1th of next month when the **Security** Council is to review such sanctions.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
Whether the Australian Government Insurance Corporation will be a viable proposition or not will depend upon the Australian people and the business the Corporation attracts.

* So it might be, for the very good reason that it might offer better bonuses or better **security**.

* This is one of several completely new breakthroughs for which this Government is responsible in the field of social **security**.

* This Government will go down in history not only for this measure but for the social **security** it has brought to the people of Australia.

* This a breakthrough for the permanent social **security** of the people of this country.

* I mentioned these things to justify my statement that this Government will go down in history for its forward moves in social **security**.

* But when a Minister, as the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  did today, sets up a pathetic Dorothy Dixer with the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  and then proceeds to misrepresent me and other members of the Opposition and, indeed, the policies of the Opposition which are in black and white for him to read, that becomes a serious matter.

* The Minister for Social **Security** made that cheap gibe at me, saying that I am interested only in the proprietors of nursing homes and not the people in them.

* The Minister for Social **Security** will correct me if I am wrong; but, if my memory serves me correctly, no increase has been given in nursing home benefits since we left office.

* The Advisory Council consists of the Chief Officers and Senior Administrative Officers of the State Health and Hospitals Departments or Commissions and of the Australian Government Departments of Health and Social **Security**.

* The 4 changes to the unemployment benefit system which were outlined by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  both in January this year and again last week can be denned as follows: Firstly, the definition of 'suitable employment' is to be widened after a reasonable period of time; secondly, unemployment beneficiaries will be required to lodge income statements personally at Commonwealth Employment Service offices each fortnight; thirdly, unemployment benefits will not be paid to school leavers during the long vacation period; and fourthly, persons who become voluntarily unemployed will not be paid unemployment benefit for a period of 6 weeks after registration with the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* This is a very elastic provision both for the Department of Social **Security** and for the Government to apply policy in order that those people who have a case and require assistance most certainly will receive it.

* We were told by the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  of the vast number of appeals- some 62.6 per cent- that were upheld by the Department without reference to the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal.

* Will the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  be the next one?

* What schools in Australia need, whether they be classified in the lowest categories or the highest categories is **security**, and what they do not have under the legislation as proposed by this Government is **security**.

* What they would have under the policies as enunciated by the Liberal and Country Parties would be this **security**.

* Anybody who has had any experience in managing any organisation would know that you need to know what **security** you have for the future.

* They are deprived this basic **security** by the legislation proposed by the present Government.

* What we seek to do is to provide **security** for all independent schools, no matter what category they are in.

* We believe it is vital for a successful Service that people should have the **security** that flows from a successfully operating fund.

* Their Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund does not operate with the same **security** as the Superannuation Fund.

* These are the trends: Commonwealth expenditure on social **security** and welfare programs has increased from less than 1 7 per cent of the total outlay in 1 967-68 to more than 27 per cent today, 10 years later.

* All these things have to be loaded on to the costs of any economy and these are some of the reasons why pensioners and others dependent on social **security** payments are not receiving the payments they should expect to receive.

* Other members of the Opposition have made reference to the lack of portability in the Australian social **security** payments, particularly in regard to age pensions.

* But I do want, before I finish, to stress the important points the Labor Party has been advocating in respect of social **security**.

* The honourable member for Parramatta was talking about a sensible and rational approach to the question of funeral benefits, pensions and social **security**.

* Honourable members on the Government side talk about rationalising the social **security** system.

* I told the honourable member for Griffith then that some $75m of the allocation of $3, 800m in the current budget for our social **security** system goes into administration, which is perhaps 2 per cent of the whole.

* I think the figure cited by the honourable member for Griffith was that it costs $8,000 to administer the social **security** system for every person in Australia on the poverty line.

* Our total social **security** payments are $3, 800m and the total budget is $23,000m.

* The Australian social **security** system does need a thorough overhaul but, like a lot of things in this life, steps should not be taken which produce irrevocable and irreparable damage to some while things are being worked out.

* If the Government does not know exactly where it is going in the field of social **security** payments the logical step for it to take in a compassionate and humane society is to continue existing benefits until they can be replaced adequately.

* It should continue on until it has done something about the total social **security** system.

* I would be the first to admit that our social **security** system is complicated, inequitable and perhaps often wasteful in some areas.

* In my view the repatriation system has many techniques which would be of advantage if applied to the social **security** system.

* Some of the standards that we apply to pensions in the repatriation field could easily and equally be of benefit to pensions in the social **security** system.

* The Speech lists very important matters such as social **security** which will affect the basic welfare of Australians.

* I believe that the Government is to be congratulated on the progress which has already been made to see that all Australian citizens have available to them a wide range of social **security** benefits when and if they need them.

* For instance  1  would like to see more local participation in the field of social **security**.

* We should look to the **security** of this country and not sweep the matter under the carpet.

* Is it to cause us to abandon our future, our **security**, our defence and our relations with the one country that could stand between us and what is an ever-growing threat in the north?

* There is the ever important consideration of the **security** of Australia and every person in this nation.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1) and (2) A capital grant of $21,645 under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act has been approved for the Country Women's Association (Yea Branch) towards the cost of constructing two self-contained units for aged persons' accommodation at Railway Place, Yea, which is adjacent to Francis Street, Yea.

* The Act provides for the formal documentation of the grant by an agreement at the discretion of the Director-General of Social **Security**.

* The capital of the corporation, including the uncalled capita], will provide **security** for those who lend to it.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and his Department have had the benefit of the opinions of all these parties throughout the extraordinarily limited time which has been available for public debate.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has also sought to mislead the public about the extent of health insurance cover.

* Clause 130 of the Health Insurance Bill seeks to provide certain protections, but sub-clause (3) of that clause provides substantial opportunity for the waiver of such protections and clause 131 actually allows the Minister to delegate these powers of waiver to any officer of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Minister said that the Government was going to build ships overseas because the **security** of Australian shipyards was not good enough.

* The **security** of overseas shipyards is no better than that of our own.

* They are looking for **security**, and that is what most workers look for.

* The Government should reach some basis of understanding with these people, because once again their concern is for the **security** of their position and their future.

* The White Paper on defence calls for the most wide-ranging debate in the community on an extremely important topic which the White Paper points out is the first priority or first duty of the Government, namely, the **security** of the nation.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Before I turn to that part of my speech I draw the attention of the House to an excellent statement made by the Ambassador for Canada in the United Nations **Security** Council on 24 February this year.

* In that speech to the **Security** Council,  Mr Barton  emphasised that one could not look at the present violence in Indo-China independently from what has become known as the Vietnamese refugee problem.

* It is to Canada's credit that it was the first nation in the **Security** Council debate to appreciate the link between the situation of violence and the refugee problem.

* Tonight I want to examine what the Government has described as its new and comprehensive commitment to regional **security**.

* This is what the Government represents as Australia's role in regional **security**.

* The legislation provides for the collection of information and I am not sure that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is the best body to do that.

* 1 would also like to state that if we are to achieve closer liaison between Australia and New Guinea in the fields of agriculture and livestock production, which 1 believe is needed over time, serious consideration must be given - apparently this Government will not give it, but a Labor government certainly will - to the establishment of what is called a high **security** quarantine station in Australia.

* Australia is one of the few developed countries which do not have a high **security** quarantine station for the introduction of plant and animal material.

* If we are to develop more closely with New Guinea we need to have high **security** quarantine stations in Australia.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 17 August 1977: 
Social  **security** payments will be tied to a pro portion of the average weekly earnings.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
This is a most explosive factor.

* They, believed that the Government would look after their **security**.

* At great personal inconvenience and expense he arranged the finance, borrowed on the **security** of a maturing life insurance policy, paid a deposit of $50 to secure the contract, $695 for excavation and $1,200 for concrete work.

* Has each member of his personal staff undergone a **security** clearance.

* Has any member of his staff ever refused to undergo procedures for **security** clearance.

* Were any submissions received from the United States Government or representatives of it which relate to **security** clearances of members of his personal staff.

* If so, would certain classified material have been withheld if **security** procedures were not adopted.

* I believe that every Australian values our **security**.

* The list, incorporated in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  has been accepted by the Australian Optometrical Association, after being drawn up by an independent ophthalmologist.

* Clause 8 of the Bill provides for the Minister for Social **Security** to draw up a common form of undertaking.

* The Bill, by clause 18, empowers the Minister for Social **Security** to make special arrangements in these cases.

* We have heard 2 speeches from the Government side - one from the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  who gave us a rather academic lecture, and the other from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  who attempted to give a great list of excuses for the Government's action or lack of action.

* The history of the dealings between the project managers and the Department of Social **Security** has not been particularly happy, to say the least.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  with whom I join in urging the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to reconsider this matter, and I over the last few days have approached the Minister's office on a number of occasions and also have discussed the matter in depth with the project managers.

* This delay, according to our system of government, regrettably is to be referred to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Its problems have been aggravated not so much by over production by what we call the established wheat farmer but by the new men who went into the industry in recent years because of the stabilised price, the guaranteed returns and the **security** that they gave.

* High interest rates will always kill, restrict and restrain development and **security** amongst those people who must pay them, irrespective of whether they are home builders, developers or farmers.

* Look at law reform, in particular: The legislation on the Ombudsman, on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, on criminal investigation, on the Federal Court and associated courts.

* The ADAA is another casualty of the dishonest and destructive Fraser 
As the honourable member will know this matter has also been referred to the United Nations **Security** Council not because we felt that any action could be taken there but to inform it.

* The various members of the delegation of the Djakarta Conference countries have put their cases individually to all members of the **Security** Council.

* We feel it would be imprudent if any further action were taken because in the face of Communist hostility it would mean that the **Security** Council would be divided.

* and (3) It has also been the long standing practice of successive Governments not to disclose matters relating to **security** intelligence.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 29 August 1979: 
However, I commend Labor on one of the decisions which it made in early 1973, and that was the payment to unemployed adults of the same benefit as was paid to other social **security** beneficiaries.

* The Department of Social **Security** conducted a survey of 112 000 beneficiaries, and one result of that survey showed that 30 per cent of payments to those people were terminated.

* They have suffered real poverty because the departments involved- the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security**- have been too slow in assessing their situation.

* I believe that the Department of Social **Security** and the Commonwealth Employment Service are not sympathetic in treating the selfemployed.

* Finally, I refer to the standard of advice and service given at counters in Commonwealth Employment Service offices and Department of Social **Security** offices.

* To be fair to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, let me say that this happens more in the Department of Social **Security** offices than in offices under his jurisdiction.

* Total seasonal carryon requirements were provided year by year upon a crop lien and properly mortgaged **security**.

* I think it is time that somewhere along the line we set out the guidelines to establish the necessary confidence and **security** in the financial market in this country to encourage investors, whether they be private or from the merchant banking fields, insurance corporations or government, and to galvanise the internal capital to preserve and maintain these resources which are the real wealth of this country.

* I challenge the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who has just made that absolutely unsubstantiated smear to give the Parliament any of the information upon which such a scurrilous claim is based so that it can be judged by this House.

* It has become absolutely and completely typical for the Minister for Social **Security** again and .

* Anyone who heard the Minister for Social **Security** speaking a few minutes ago about the problems of aged persons homes and hostels would, I think, clearly understand precisely what terrifies us about the Labor health scheme.

* Another point made toy the Minister for Social **Security** is that one of the main reasons why migrants will not stay in Australia is that we do not have a universal health scheme.

* -Yes, the Government is aware of the resolution before the **Security** Council.

* As honourable members will be aware, sanctions voted by the **Security** Council are binding on all members of the United Nations.

* Meanwhile, however, in common with the United States and the 
United Kingdom which are sponsoring the negotiations, and in common with the United Nations members generally, Australia will continue to apply sanctions as voted by the **Security** Council.

* I commended the Government in the Budget debate on many measures within the social **security** field.

* I think the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr 
In supporting the Bills, I would like to make just a few comments.

* I am therefore very pleased to see that a special committee within the national commission on social **security** is attending to that because I know of one or two circumstances myself which are undesirable.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**,  upon  notice: 
Recent debates on defence have not produced the quality which this House is capable of displaying in consideration of Australian **security** policy.

* When I spoke to the Parliament last August about the strategic prospect, I said that our situation (was) favourable and that various important factors and trends in the international situation (supported) Australian **security** into the longer term'.

* Our defence policy is not geared simply to some specific threat or pressure against Australia's national **security** or immediate strategic interests.

* Therefore, any concern that West Australians have about their economic and military **security** in terms of the State's natural resources should be shared fully and equally by the rest of Australia.

* The implications for the **security** of Indonesia and Australia would, to say the least, have been disturbing if this scenario had unfolded.

* I do not underrate the importance of health and the need for physical and social **security**.

* However, for me it is the **security** of the nation upon which all other **security** rests.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 28 May 1979: 
Minister for Social **Security** 
Minister for Social **Security** 
 On Tuesday afternoon this week, a matter of public importance was discussed in this House which stressed the need for the Government to make a statement on the 'Plight of the People of South Vietnam in their courageous defence against the blatant invasion by North Vietnam and its serious implications for the **security** of Australia'.

* The Government has been able gradually to increase the degree of **security** it could afford the villagers against the threats of coercion of the Vietcong.

* When the increase in publicly provided benefits in education, health, social **security** and so on is added in, his total real income rose by 9.3 per cent.

* by leave - The honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  inquired at question time this morning inter alia whether a representative of IBM was accompanying officers of the Department of Social **Security** presently in Canada.

* At that time I had no knowledge of the matter but undertook to check his claim./ Perhaps I could commence by pointing out that the Department of Social **Security** currently is engaged in an intensive investigation and planning exercise to determine the computer equipment which will be required for its future operations.

* I should point out that most of the equipment used by the Department  of  Social **Security** is IBM equipment.

* But would social **security** beneficiaries want to receive increased benefits at the cost of death and injury to people elsewhere on the globe?

* The new and enlightened Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has brought a new dimension in the all-important field of social **security**.

* It is simply not true to say, as many members of the Opposition have said, that our enlightened legislative social **security** program will encourage people not to work.

* The decision to provide aid for aged relatives is a real and positive break-through in social **security**.

* National superannuation and the means test are being dealt with by a devoted, capable and very energetic Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Prime Minister has quoted from Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation files.

* Its purpose was to help, jointly with the United States and others, to sustain and develop the confidence of the Government and the people of the Republic; to help defend it; to develop its capacities to deal with both overt aggression and externally promoted insurgency; and to enable it to make its own decisions about its future in a context of greater **security**.

* **Security** throughout the country has improved remarkably.

* There, the **security** situation has markedly improved.

* In coming to this judgment we have on each occasion considered several factors, including whether the forces and administration of the Republic have been ready and able to assume increased responsibility for local **security**.

* This does not mean that **security** in the area is yet fully achieved.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 14 November 1978: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Tonight we are dealing with the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Bill.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said in his contribution to this debate, the Bill does not go  to the  fundamentals of the human problems of those among us who are for a variety of reasons unable to live what we fondly call a normal life.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The grants have been publicised as being provided by the Commonwealth.

* The approvals have been the subject of joint press releases by the Minister for Social **Security** and the former Victorian Minister for Community Welfare Services, the  Hon.

* In addition, the Minister for Social **Security** wrote to all Federal Senators and to appropriate honourable Members on 28 December 1978, advising them of those projects approved for support under the Scheme 's second year of operation.

* There has been a fantastic increase in social **security** benefits.

* Quite clearly, in the preparation of the Budget the Government will have to consider the wide range of demands which are put before it for improved benefits, for instance in the field of social **security**, and measure these demands against the resources which can be made available.

* The Government, on its record, has been outstanding in the range of priorities and the generosity with which it has responded to that range of priorities that it has taken up in the field of social **security**.

* We now pay unemployment and sickness benefits at the same rate as our other forms of social **security** benefits.

* This year in the Department of Social **Security** we will be spending over $3,000m in support of various forms of programs for which my Department is responsible.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'provisions for the granting of supplementary assistance to pensioners should be considered only in context with the Government's total social **security** program upon which it should be commended.'

* Is the Department of Social **Security** also seeking an office in Northcote in which to locate approximately SO staff.

* If so, will he consult with the Minister for Administrative Services with a view to seeking the establishment of a Commonwealth Government office in Northcote housing both the CES and the Department of Social **Security**.

* It would be necessary to refer to the British Department of Health and Social **Security** for advice as to whether sickness benefit would be payable in the circumstances mentioned.

* This is what the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is trying to thrust upon us, despite his denials.

* It states: 
When one looks at the actions of the Minister for Social **Security** in recent months one sees that he is starving out the various nursing homes.

* I say to the Minister for Social **Security**: Just because you will succeed with a joint sitting next week, do not take this as the green light to move this nation along the path of madness and of no return.

* With reference to the proposed surcharge tax on income from deposits in building societies, credit unions and savings banks, as well as retirement benefits, will this tax also apply to interest on Special **Security** Bonds.

* That this House calls on the Government to immediately reintroduce six-monthly indexation of social **security** and repatriation benefits.

* The pensioners and social **security** beneficiaries of Australia must by now be convinced that talk is indeed cheap.

* On 12 October last year this House made the pretence of debating amendments to the Repatriation and Social **Security** Acts.

* The Government abolished six-monthly indexation to save $4m on war pensions and $27m on social **security** benefits.

* Making political footballs out of the two million men, women and children directly or indirectly dependent upon social **security** payments is less than cheap.

* In 1976 the present Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman),  who was at that time Minister for Repatriation, had this to say on behalf of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle): 
The Government has given a commitment to protect social **security** pensions from erosion by inflation through automatically adjusting pension levels each six months according to movements in the CPI.

* Social **security** beneficiaries are slipping further and further below the poverty line.

* I put it to the House that it is unfair and cruel to raise the hopes of the pensioners and other social **security** and repatriation beneficiaries in this country.

* It was told to the Senate this afternoon by the Minister for Social **Security** and it has been claimed in Press reports that it was told to Government members by the Prime Minister at their joint party meeting, that no matter what this House decides on this particular matter, the Government will not go ahead with six-monthly indexation, that no money will be provided.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 May 1978: 
1 ) How many persons have been removed from the unemployment benefit list as a result of the present survey by inspectors of the Department of Social **Security** and the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* Were the amendments proposed by the Opposition to be accepted, one would get dangerously close to ministerial directions being required to be carried out in detail by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* It ought to be noted in passing that ASIO, when it was first set up under the Chifley Government, was set up under significant advice from the British domestic **security** organisation which had a military origin.

* For reasons of common sense, for reasons of what occurs elsewhere in Australian society, for reasons of what occurs with respect to other organisations in Australian society, and for reasons of no guarantees as to the nature of appointments, it ought to be quite clear to this House that there ought to be no judicial review but that rights are to be determined within the valid aims of the **security** organisation.

* In matters of **security** it is undesirable that official spokesmen for government, responsible in this area, should make comment that creates unnecessary disturbance in the public mind.

* Accordingly, I was disappointed to read in the statement to the House by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner),  representing the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack),  this comment: 
Australia faces a number of serious threats to its internal **security** including persistent efforts on the part of hostile intelligence agencies to obtain intelligence from within Australia.

* I repeat the comment I made that the level of the **security** problem in this country is an informed one, a proper one, and it is put in an appropriately restrained way.

* There is no dispute from this side of the House about the need for a **security** service.

* The Labor Government established the Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation.

* But having said that we are committed to the functioning of **security** services, it does not follow ipso facto that we wish to extend immunity to **security** services from any form of criticism.

* There must be criticism of all the functioning bodies serving a democratic system and, although a degree of secrecy must be respected for our **security** agencies, that secrecy must be kept at the minimal practical level.

* The emotionalism which has been associated with so much of the objection to constructive critics in the past in my view has been couched out of concern to protect our **security** agency from any sort of criticism rather than a genuine concern about establishing or maintaining the minimal level of secrecy consistent with the democratic rights of the community and, on the other hand, an appropriately effective functioning of a **security** service.

* The published and unpublished- I stress the unpublished partreports of  Mr Justice  Hope are a disturbing documentation of a **security** service that had been in disarray, a **security** service that lived on a reputation that was undeserved in the 1960s and early 1970s.

* It is obvious that in some cases the Minister responsible for ASIO had been making available **security** files to at least one government backbencher in an effort to embarrass members of the Opposition or people in the community.

* The honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  was expressing some concern about the Opposition's request that there should be more access to information coming from **security** services.

* Let me quote from the fourth report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* One has only to reflect on the spectacular activities of the Central Intelligence Agency- harmful and illegal- or the tactics of blackmail, physical threat, public smearing and so on by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, especially in relation to the late Martin Luther King, to feel that there is a justifiable case for making ASIO or any **security** institution accountable to the maximum which is practical within our society, and consistent with the needs of secrecy for its operation.

* This can be achieved by maximising ministerial responsibility, guaranteeing bipartisanship by increasing access by the Leader of the Opposition to **security** matters; periodic judicial audits of ASIO's operations; a proper and independent system of financial accountability; annual parliamentary reports and a so-called sunset clause which would guarantee periodic legislative initiative to continue the operations of ASIO.

* A former Queensland police commissioner resigned after complaining of political interference, and a former South Australian police commissioner was dismissed for withholding **security** information because he said he owed a duty higher than loyalty to the government of the day.

* Nowadays the Prime Minister embraces an almost paranoid obsession about **security**, particularly his own personal **security**, that was utterly lacking in his cavalier attitude to the manipulation of **security** records 1 3 years ago.

* There should be explicit provisions governing the relationship between the responsible Minister, the Attorney-General, and the head of internal **security**.

* Whilst the Attorney-General ought to know of the existence of individual files, their contents should be withheld unless the Director-General of ASIO considers the Minister's access is wholly in the interest of national **security**.

* The issue of bipartisanship in the operations of **security** is not insignificant.

* In the original Bill, the only access to **security** matters by the Leader of the Opposition was one of consultation by the Prime Minister before the appointment of the Director-General of ASIO.

* This does nothing to provide a deterrent to political interference, deterrence that would come from the Leader of the Opposition knowing, in detail, what our **security** organisations are doing.

* The Hope report observed: 
If there is to be a bi-partisan approach it is necessary that the Opposition Party or Parties should be informed about **security** matters, and the appropriate way to do this is by consultation between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and by reports by the Director-General of **Security** to the Leader of the Opposition.

* The other provides that the Director-General should consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition to keep him informed on **security** matters.

* Yet there is no legislative guarantee that these regular briefings are a balanced account of **security** situations.

* They would in no way hinder the proper operation of **security** in matters that are properly the concern of **security**.

* But their guarantee by legislation would help prevent improper or overzealous use of ASIO 's powers, and they would go a long way towards ensuring that the cloak of **security** is not abused for political advantage.

* The principal Bill makes no provision for a proper independent system of financial accountability, despite the fact that **security** has been one of the real growth areas during the present Government's term of office.

* Once this Bill becomes law, a person subject to an adverse or qualified **security** assessment must be told about it and may appeal to the **Security** Assessment Tribunal for a review.

* We believe that unfavourable assessments made before the start of this Act should be notified to the persons concerned and they should then have access to the Commonwealth Ombudsman who could decide whether a formal appeal should go to the **Security** Assessment Tribunal.

* There is also provision in clause 59 for ASIO itself, through the Director-General, to decide whether certain documents or information will go before the Tribunal on **security** grounds.

* **Security** agencies have frequently demonstrated an obsession and misunderstanding about some political ideas that amounts to paranoia.

* Workers 'sick leave, annual holidays, superannuation, trade union membership and eligibility for social **security** employment benefits are all factors that need to be discussed if we are to acknowledge that there is an ever increasing place for part time employment.

* He talked about **security** matters in Singapore.

* Honourable members opposite talk about **security** and keeping the Parliament informed on these matters.

* It is also because the location and role of the squadron were known to other countries that the Leader of the Opposition's charges that this Government has endangered Australia's **security** are equally without substance.

* The **security** of this nation does not depend on clandestine, underhand operations behind the backs of our friends or without the knowledge of our own countrymen, as the honourable gentleman would seem to imply.

* All of us know that a Labor government would quickly sell out our **security** and become embroiled in a tangle of domestic issues leading to extravagant inflationary expenditure.

* That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* It has to do with the **security** provisions that will now prevail around this Parliament.

* Perhaps a case can be made for some form or other of **security** to stop people coming in here and throwing stones at us or putting bombs in the place or all the rest of it, but I am not sure that this proposal will help the situation.

* The other day we gave certain support to the general idea regarding **security**.

* This unit had permanent **security** coverage.

* This unit had part-time **security** coverage.

* The unit had permanent **security** coverage.

* The unit had no **security** patrols at night.

* **Security** arrangements are kept under continuous review, and improvements as resources permit is a continuing activity.

* The Department of Social **Security** is currently acquiring computing facilities for 3 different purposes: They are: 
In relation to the equipment mentioned under (b) and (c) in the preceding paragraph, I should point out that this equipment is designed for use both by the Department of Social **Security** in connection with its current responsibilities and for the proposed 'Health Insurance Program.

* 3m for the purchase of computing equipment by the Department of Social **Security** and this is the sum that was appropriated by Parliament in Appropriation Act No.

* The Government has delayed the implementa tion of necessary measures to protect the future **security** of permanent overseas officers in the Public Service.

* The executive of the Association listed the first source of low morale as concern for job **security** and provision for retirement.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 27 September 1978: 
1 ) In respect of each computer owned or operated by the Department of Social **Security** and statutory authorities and business undertakings under the control of the Minister, what information stored therein can be sold, hired, lent or given to any person or organisation other than properly authorised employees of the Department of Social **Security**, authority or business.

* -I draw the attention of the House to the presence of  Mr Chalid  Mawardi,  Chairman  of the Indonesian Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and **Security**.

* The Government is negotiating permanent access, particularly in the beef and dairy industries, so that **security** will exist upon which farmers can plan for the first time.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 18 October 1978: 
If so, will the Department of Social **Security** investigate a program known as the 'Block Parent Program', operating in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, which allows interested adults, usually aged persons, when approved by authorities, to act in loco parentis on certain occasions, whereby children who are lost, endangered, frightened or ill are able to gain refuge in the home of an approved block parent.

* I refer to the transfer of control of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to the office of Prime Minister.

* A government will defend a police force, or in this case the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, just because it comes under the control of the Prime Minister.

* I hope that the new Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  will in his reply or at some time during the debate- if not during this debate then after he has thought about itgive some assurance that the Government does not see proposed the new section 6a of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill as preventing criticism of the holder of the position of Director-General because of his judicial background.

* We need a system of social **security** which gives comprehensive protection.

* Let us look at some of the proposals on social **security**.

* We have the power to do it and having the power we must fulfil the responsibility to introduce these things; to give people a sense of **security** and to assure them that the community is concerned about their welfare and that in times of crisis need especially there will bc adequate support for them.

* In this area of social **security** we must, as a moral responsibility in the community, introduce a system of guaranteed minimum income for those people unfortunate enough to live in the area defined as one of relative poverty.

* It can be read narrowly, which is the way he chose to read it, that is that before the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation regards activity as subversive there were to be three elements.

* I would not mind accepting the judgment of the present Director-General of **security** as to how that might be read, or the judgment of  Mr Justice  Hope or somebody like that.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has instructed his Department to pay unemployment benefits to people who cannot obtain jobs reasonably similar to those which they have previously held.

* I believe this is in complete contradistinction to the attitude adopted by the Minister for Social **Security**, who displays reckless regard for taxpayers' funds in relation to unemployment benefits.

* Because the parties have made an agreement concerning the conclusion of the debate I conclude by saying that the Minister for Social **Security** and his Government should not continue to misuse taxpayers' funds by making the unemployment benefit available to people who refuse to accept jobs open to them or who conduct themselves at job interviews in such a way that they are regarded as unemployable.

* We understood from what the Minister has said that if a person's general demeanour - namely, his long hair and unkempt appearance - is such that he is unable to obtain work from an employer he has every entitlement to the unemployment benefit which is provided to him by the Minister for Social **Security** from the taxpayers' funds.

* There would have been no opportunity to seize if it had not been for the efforts of the allies in South Vietnam to preserve the freedom and **security** of that country.

* Apart from the protection provided to a small South East Asian country it was in the interests of the **security** of this country for us to be in South Vietnam.

* I believe that the Australian Government and the Australian people can be proud of the part they have played in protecting a small South East Asian country and helping to preserve the **security** of our own great country.

* We cannot have confidence in the **security** and independence of democratic institutions of government if there is to be this unbounded power which presumably can be infected in its use by certain blandishments and approaches.

* As the second question of the day , the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  asked of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  a perfectly proper question.

* The Minister for Social **Security** gave an answer which took up less than 4 columns of Hansard.

* In the case of last Thursday the Leader of the Opposition has never denied or qualified the accuracy of the reports to which the Minister for Social **Security** and I have referred.

* That was the statement for which the 'Sydney 
Is it a fact that, while the **security** of the tower is very satisfactory, for the Civic exchange physical **security** is minimal.

* Is he satisfied with the **security** of these exchanges.

* This is in line with the legislative action that was taken to remove any doubts that the diplomatic appointments of  Sir John  Latham and  Sir Owen  Dixon in 1940 and 1942 respectively, and the appointment last year of  Mr Justice  Woodward as Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, may have had on their judicial offices.

* We on this side believe that the defence of this nation - its safety and **security** - should have top priority.

* As I said earlier, the defence and the **security** of Australia must, at all times, be paramount.

* If so, do the opposing definitions used by the Taxation Commissioner and the Department of Social **Security** disadvantage the individual and benefit consolidated revenue as a consequence.

* Why does the Taxation Commissioner treat a de facto spouse as single while the Department of Social **Security** treats a de facto spouse as married.

* Department of Social **Security**- Assessment of noise in workshops at Queen Elizabeth II Rehabilitation Centre.

* Department of Social **Security**, Perth- Assessment of noise of office machinery.

* The third disturbing aspect is the fact that the unemployment benefit funds are actually coming from the budget of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and not, as they should, from the budget of the Department of Social **Security**.

* In the majority of these cases the Aborigines want to work because they want to earn their social **security** moneys.

* However, the Opposition finds it wholly objectionable that, together with the funding cuts already effected in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, unemployment benefit payments should have to come from the scanty funds of that Department and not from the funds of the Department of Social **Security**.

* A report entitled 'A Place of Dignity' was tabled by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on 9 June 1978.

* Following correspondence between the Prime 
In April 1966 I asked, apropos to the commitment of April 1965, whether the position was still the same as  Mr Hasluck  had told the then honourable member for Yarra and he said 'Yes' and I asked him was this the reason why we had not made a reference to any request in our notification to the **Security** Council - as he had told me - and he said that we did not spell it out to the **Security** Council, we gave a comprehensive reply.

* The Government proposes that all pensions, excluding supplementary payments, paid under the social **security** legislation to people of pensionable age, including wives of age pensioners, will be taxable.

* From the wide publicity which has been given to some 'Socialists' who have been allowed to visit Australia - and the word 'Socialist' is a somewhat imprecise euphemism in such circumstances - it will be perfectly evident to all honourable members that the Australian Government's attitude to the entry of such people is essentially flexible, although careful attention must always be paid to national **security**.

* That means that those persons affected by the estimates for the Departments of Health, Social **Security** and Veterans' Affairs will have a substantial improvement in their positions compared with their positions over the past few years.

* As to the broad aspects of social **security**, it is vitally important that the Government maintains compassionate programs for people in need within its budgetary requirements and capacity.

* The special reports branch of my Department will maintain the closest possible liaison with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, the Commonwealth Police and State law enforcement agencies.

* Officers of this branch are neither police officers nor **security** officers.

* The Leader of the Opposition also referred to the resolution adopted unanimously by the United Nations **Security** Council.

* During the session Australia will be elected a .member of the **Security** Council.

* Filled with optimism this group of nations envisaged the development of a system of collective international **security**, a system that the League of Nations had failed dismally to create after the First World War.

* In the **Security** Council the frequent use of the veto by the Soviet Union served constantly to paralyse the organisation in matters concerning world **security**.

* If we exclude the Korean war in which the United Nations participation was secured only through the absence of the Soviet representative on the **Security** Council - a situation which is unlikely to occur again - the only major operations have been in the Congo and Cyprus.

* In the Indo-China conflict - perhaps the most serious issue in international **security** since the end of the Second World War - the United Nations has played no role whatever.

* It is a sad commentary on the United Nations that most changes for the better in world **security** have taken place outside the world organisation.

* Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was saying that most changes for the better in world **security** had taken place outside the United Nations.

* I would like to go on to say that the detente in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States owes nothing to the United Nations General Assembly or to the **Security** Council.

* One issue which posed a sudden serious threat to global **security**, the Cuba crisis, was settled by a direct contact between Washington and Moscow.

* In the IndoPakistani war the **Security** Council did, after much debate, reach a resolution urging a cease fire but only when the war had virtually come to the end desired by the Soviet Union.

* Influence on matters concerning world **security** still remains the province of the great powers.

* It was originally intended that the **Security** Council should occupy the role of the supreme tribunal of internatonal peace and **security**.

* The presence of the People's Republic of China on the **Security** Council has meant that the trend will be towards more vetoes, more verbal confrontation and even less agreement than there has been in the past.

* As is already the case in the General Assembly, not all of the decisions of the **Security** Council will necessarily be in Australia's interests.

* Australian membership of the **Security** Council will therefore not necessarily mean that Australia will be contributing towards the improvement of world **security**, decisions on which will in the future, as in the past, probably be taken outside the Council's chambers.

* The **Security** Council is an important forum for debate and for the expression of views.

* It will give Australian representatives a unique opportunity to familiarise themselves more fully with the present trends in great power relationships, particularly as they impinge upon the prospects of **security** in the Asian region.

* The scheme was administered by the Universities Commission in co-operation with the Directorate of Manpower under the National **Security** Regulations in force at that time.

* the Treaty, the question of a report to the **Security** Council has not arisen.

* In April 1966 I asked, apropos to the commitment of April 1965, whether the position was still the same as  Mr Hasluck  had told the then honourable member for Yarra and he said 'Yes' and I asked him was this the reason why we had not made a reference to any request in our notification to the **Security** Council - as he had told me - and he said that we did not spell it out to the **Security** Council; we gave a comprehensive reply.

* It was admitted by the Minister that we had never had a request under the SEATO treaty and that is why we did not report the matter to the **Security** Council or ask for United Nations action in the matter.

* Within a few months we will be taking further action to overcome this thoroughly undesirable situation where social **security** benefits provide a living standard below a poverty line defined by the researchers who set it as being at a very austere level.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has made promises in regard to pensions.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has an unworkable health scheme which has been rejected not just by the Senate and this Parliament but by his own Party because, search as one would in the Queen's Speech, one can find no mention of such a scheme coming back in.

* He raided the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation on 16 March 1973.

* It will be realised that the social **security** systems of various countries differ from one another and differ from our Australian system in different ways, so that no firm rule can be set for the details of these agreements; each one will have to be drawn up in terms of the mutual relationship of our Australian system to that of the participating country.

* Indeed, this is the principle which migrants themselves have endorsed in their journals: They say, very rightly, that those who have earned their pension by their contribution to the Australian scene should, by virtue of that contribution, have the right to take their pension home, lt is for this reason that, with the exceptions for invalids and widows, we have prescribed a qualifying period of 20 years - which is more generous, for example, than what is done in Canada, where the qualifying period is 25 years for portability of the old age **security** pension.

* The Bill before the House, while not confined to migrants, is the latest of a series of measures introduced by this Government to assist migrants who have need of Australian social **security** in their widowhood, ill health or old age.

* While substantial restructuring and readjustments in the industry are inevitable the scheme now before the House will provide some cushioning of these effects and will be a steadying influence on those lenders who are concerned to realise on their **security**.

* This role was exercised initially by means of National **Security** Regulations which provided for a Stevedoring Industry Commission under the chairmanship of the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.

* The inflexibility of the size of the labour force- the redundancy problem and the difficulty of reducing effectively the size of the workforce as well as maintaining a skilled work force not composed entirely of the more elederly workers, as well as the financial **security** of the waterside worker.

* To fawn upon them is, I believe, only giving away the safety and **security** of this country for years ahead.

* I hope that we in Australia do not become lulled into a false sense of **security** by feeling that the United Nations has all the solutions to the problems confronting the world today.

* We say that these problems are complex and we also say that in the interests of Australia and its future this Government has done much for our safety and **security**.

* The report on the survey conducted recently by the Department of Social **Security**- I refer to the booklet entitled 'A Place of Dignity' which is the report on a survey of homeless people and homeless persons assistance centres- opened with the comment that an estimated 10,000 homeless men and women in Australia were being assisted by welfare agencies.

* The most recent survey conducted by the Department of Social **Security**, as set out in this booklet entitled A Place of Dignity', also found that there was a high rate of illness and disability amongst the homeless persons surveyed.

* It goes on to say: 
That is pretty sophisticated and fancy language but it is interesting to note that the most recent survey undertaken by the Department of Social **Security** states that these structural kinds of causes were not advanced as being of any significance.

* The most fundamental, of course, is the political philosophy of the Labor Government which relegates defence to a priority so low that if the people on the other side of the House were frankly prepared to admit it, they would say that they are not seriously concerned with the defence and **security** of Australia.

* I have regretfully come to believe that despite the greatly increased service input into the Defence Department, the proposed re-organisation is a mistake of unprecedented magnitude- far beyond that of the short-lived pentropic division and with far greater implications for the defence and **security** of Australia .

* This refers to someone who has the responsibility of defending this nation and who has the responsibility of making sure that everything is just right for the **security** of this nation.

* The honourable member, when he was Minister for Social **Security**, had the idea that they should all be closed down and put into the hands of charitable organisations.

* Those of us who have observed the reaction to the performance of the previous Minister for Social **Security** will know that Labor has left us with a legacy of a huge shortage of nursing home beds.

* I refer once again to the treatment of the private nursing homes by the Minister for Social **Security** in the Labor Government,  Mr Hayden,  when, in effect, his actions virtually closed the doors of many nursing homes.

* In addition to communications, the Post Office provides part of the machinery of the social **security** system, and many other kinds ot business are transacted at Post Office counters.

* The Prime Minister must realise that such action on his part cannot contribute to the stability and **security** of the Khmer Republic.

* Everybody realises the necessity for adequate **security** in such situations.

* Since then we have had an inquiry in respect of the adequacy of our **security** in Parliament House and certain proposals have been made in connection with that.

* I did observe that Army officers were used on traffic control, and presumably they were being used for the maintenance of **security**.

* One wonders whether the Victorian Government conceded that the Victorian Police were inadequate in their capacity to control traffic or indeed to sustain the **security** that was necessary.

* I have no doubt in my mind that the police could have dealt adequately with traffic control and **security** at the funeral last week of  Sir Robert  Menzies.

* As we know, there is very little in the way of **security** employment associated with CYSS programs.

* I can quite honestly say to the Government that nobody in my electorate believes that the Government is doing anything in terms of maintaining substantial programs, offering **security** of employment to people or offering **security** even for the trainees who embark upon programs and then find that they are suspended in mid-stream.

* It transpired during the course of the interview that the third party with the two Immigration officials was allegedly an Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation agent and that this ASIO agent informed  Mr Vorstman  that if he was prepared to become an informer for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation - that is an informer on the Communist Party, on political activity and on general radical movements in the community - this would favourably influence the outcome of his application for Australian citizenship.

* It would be highly undesirable for the Department of Immigration to be working hand in glove in this way with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* But it would be even more undesirable that an ASIO agent in company with officials of the Department of Immigration should be in a position to say to  Mr Vorstman  or to any other person seeking Australian citizenship that although he was having difficulty and had been having difficulty for some time in obtaining Australian citizenship a more favourable attitude might very well develop on the part of officialdom if that person became an informer for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* We are deeply concerned to enable them ... to have some **security** in their relationship with the land and, in particular, to give continuing Aboriginal groups and communities the opportunity of obtaining an appropriate  title  under Australian law over lands on reserves which they are interested in to use and develop for economic and social purposes.

* Apart from this, all the Opposition has said is: 'Take the matter to the **Security** Council'.

* Last week, the Government with other governments including those of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Japan called for an urgent meeting of the **Security** Council.

* Our **security** and economic prosperity depend upon it.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
What expenditures have been made in recent years under major programs administered by the Department of Social **Security** in the electoral divisions of Chifley, Macquarie, Mitchell, Parramatta, Prospect and Werriwa  (Hansard.

* If the honourable member would like to come with me at some time to the St George electorate and support me and find out some of the difficulties and problems of other ethnic groups, including the Greek people, and then come with me to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to try to help obtain some of the grants we are hoping to get to assist the ethnic people in the St George and surrounding areas, then he is very welcome.

* If he would like to come to the opening of the Rockdale Macedonian community child care centre, which is now being built with a federal government grant of $200,000 in Arncliffe, when the Minister for Social **Security** opens it in a few months time, and praise the Government, he is more than welcome to come along and be party to those proceedings.

* Obviously the legislation provides for improvement in benefit rates for a number of beneficiaries of the social **security** system.

* That legislation would, if in isolation from the general improvement benefits, result in disadvantages being imposed on a number of social **security** beneficiaries in the community.

* Such is the nature of the penalty, the fine if you like, which social **security** beneficiaries have to pay because of the curious philosophy of the Prime Minister when he" says that he wants less dependency on government services, he wants a situation which will allow people to retain more of their income so that they can provide more for themselves.

* It cannot be suggested that the continuation for 3 months of the married rate of pension in the event of the death of one partner is some sort of substitution for the deprivation of the funeral benefit, as is implied in statements from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and from some members of the Government.

* I move on to children's allowances as a further illustration of the cold neglect that Liberal governments of the past assumed casually and of the cold neglect that this Government is seeking to reintroduce by the way in which it is treating social **security** benefits.

* The only period of government in which some semblance of concern was reflected by a substantial improvement in the rate of initiatives in social **security** matters was that period administered by a former Prime Minister, John Grey Gorton, a bigger man than just about any of his detractors can ever hope to be.

* I challenge the members of this Government to explain why they were prepared to tolerate so much deprivation for so many people dependent on social **security** benefits for so long.

* Frankly, all of these people are under threat because of statements which have been made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who for some reason seems to feel that these women will be strengthened and their moral fibre will be enhanced if in some way the benefit is attenuated or perhaps even destroyed.

* As we are dealing in this cognate debate not only with social **security** matters but also repatriation amendments, I again say that many of the things I have said about social **security** apply with equal force to repatriation benefits.

* I should like to give the House examples of some false statements - I am not allowed to use the word 'lies' - which have been made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in his campaign to denigrate the medical profession by attacking medical fees to draw attention away from the problems that will come into Australia if we ever socialise medicine.

* I believe that the Minister for Social **Security** is acting very much as  Dr Goebbels  acted in the Hitler regime in Nazi Germany.

* I have 7 specific examples of false statements by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I referred also to the special services which were being provided by the Department of Social **Security**, the offer of temporary accommodation help by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson),  the assistance from other departments and the donations totalling $600,000 that the Australian Government had made to public relief funds.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The disturbances in Iran, the instability in the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan, also have important implications for Australia.

* Western governments have made clear their wish for continued good relations with Iran and their hope that after a period of great difficulty and uncertainty for the Iranian people and the region, stability and **security** will now return.

* We ought to do what we reasonably can to promote conditions there which will bring about stability and **security**.

* The outlook beyond that is uncertain, a fact which must remind us of the added **security** that accompanies a high level of selfsufficiency and the necessity for this Government's oil policies.

* The then Minister for Social **Security**, the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden),  in his second reading speech said: 
The speech from which that quotation is extracted was made on 27 November 1974.

* In fairness, I must say that it brought a reasonable response from the spokesman for social **security** at the time- it was Don Chipp as a matter of fact- who said- I quote him word for word: 
This Bill, as innocuous as it is, represents a green light that this scheme is going to go on in the future even though no money is involved in its passage.

* An internal report within the Department of Social **Security** some time ago stated, in part: 
It is obvious that the Government is hell bent on cutting social **security** payments and reducing the value of the pensions- the value we put into them.

* I ask the Minister for Defence representing the Minister for Repatriation and, if necessary, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social **Security**: What action has the Government taken to restore the medical benefits of the wives of totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners who were so affected by the last Budget?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* by leave -  Mr Speaker,  the Government has been reviewing the position of Australia's military forces in Vietnam in order to determine what further withdrawal options are open to it, having regard to the **security** situation and the intentions of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam and of our other major allies.

* These consultations have confirmed our assessment that steady improvement is being achieved in the **security** situation.

* The pacification programme has also achieved notable successes, and its contribution towards improved **security** in the rural areas has necessitated the enemy concentrating his effort against that programme.

* Turning to the overall **security** of South Vietnam, it is undeniable that there has been satisfactory progress towards the objective of establishing the circumstances in which South Vietnam can determine its own future.

* This timetable will permit detailed adjustments to be made between the Australian, South Vietnamese, and United States military, authorities in relation to the **security** requirements of the areas involved.

* But perhaps more than ever before, the Government of the Republic acknowledges that getting on top of the internal threat to **security** and the development of progressive government in the provinces are tasks best performed by themselves once a sufficient degree of **security** from massive external attack has been established.

* As to the future of our forces in Vietnam, the Government will keep the matter under constant review, bearing in mind the **security** of our own forces and our obligations to the Government of the Republic of Vietnam.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security** upon notice, on 2 June 1977: 
1 ) Is it a fact that since 8 May 1973 people who leave Australia have been entitled to continue to receive social **security** benefits.

* Twenty-five per cent of total outlays of this Government of $24,32 lm, namely $6, 187m is being spent on social **security** and welfare.

* Under the heading 'Social **Security** Benefit Rates' the Hayden Budget Speech stated: 
We guarantee that age, invalid, widows' pensions, war and war widows' pensions, and other weekly social **security** and repatriation benefits, will in future be adjusted automatically, every half year to changes in living standards.

* The Labor Party would however retain the power of conscription, in the words of the Labor Party platform, 'should the **security** of Australia be threatened'.

* Our defence capability would be thereby considerably impaired, with obvious implications for our national **security**.

* The Government's decision and consistent policy to maintain national service on a continuing basis is a policy which is in the best interests of the defence **security** of Australia and is certainly a policy which has been endorsed by the majority of Australians, as evidenced in continuing gallup polls which have taken place on this subject in recent years.

* National service must be seen as one aspect, an important aspect, of the defence effort expended in this country to ensure national **security** by maintaining effective defence forces and in particular an Army of a size consistent with this goal.

* -This evening I want to register my strong personal objection to the so-called **security** measures adverted to just a few moments ago by the Government Whip, the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bourchier).

* They are very serious matters which warrant the kind of **security** measures and the infringement upon the rights of members of this Parliament and of Australians to enter the parliamentary building in the course of their normal activities, that we are now witnessing.

* Let us have a look at the first incident after these so called **security** measures were announced.

* 1 ask the Minister for External Affairs: What steps have been taken to see that South African Airways comply, as Qantas Airways Ltd already complies, with the United Nations **Security** Council's embargo on trade with Southern Rhodesia by discontinuing the sale of air tickets to that country7 What steps are being taken to see that Qantas complies with another aspect of the embargo by discontinuing its advertising in newspapers in Southern Rhodesia?

* National **Security** Regulations 1939.

* I indicated that the Bill does give effect substantially to the second and fourth reports of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** headed by  Mr Justice  Hope.

* I indicated that the purpose of the legislation was to place the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in a new structure and that its powers and functions had been redefined as a result of that inquiry.

* I also pointed out that a major **security** appeals tribunal is to be established and that the Bill also deals with the staffing of ASIO.

* In supporting the legislation, I indicated why there was a need for a balanced approach- an approach which recognised the importance of obtaining intelligence and **security** information and balancing that against the needs of the community to have information in relation to the Organisation, but not so as to hamper the Organisation's work and effort.

* The Opposition has indicated that it does not oppose the concept of having a **security** organisation.

* I suppose it is my term when I say it, but it seems clear to me that what the Opposition wants to do is gut the Organisation and make sure that it is not an effective **security** organisation.

* If one wants that, if one wants the **security** organisation to be populated by people who are looking over their shoulder all the time to see who is watching them in that sense, then one will have an impotent organisation.

* It will be of more advantage to Russian **security** organisationsthe KGB or something of that nature- for them to know how much money is going into ASIO, where it is spent and what are its priorities.

* If one has obsessions about this Organisation, I suppose one would want to see that sort of information because one would not be concerned about our overall **security**.

* There are some people in the Opposition who have such a phobia about this legislation that in my view they are prepared to put those phobias above this nation's **security**.

* The Opposition, along with one of my colleagues on this side of the House, wants to ensure that all persons who are the subject of a **security** report will be notified of the existence of any adverse assessment about them.

* What the Opposition is saying is that if ASIO identifies a spy in the Commonwealth Public Service- someone who is in a fairly senior position and whose existence one does not wish to disclose for a whole lot of **security** reasons, such as wishing to see who his other contacts are- one ought to tell him that he has had an adverse **security** report, warn him that he had been found out and give him the opportunity to appeal.

* We need a defence force with capabilities affording the Government of the day the option of giving defence help to regional friends with whom we have common **security** interests, should they wish this- whether this be the south-west Pacific, Papua New Guinea, or other countries to our immediate north.

* It is in respect of armed threats within our own geographic environment that our allies could be expected to look to Australia to be reasonably self-reliant, and to make a maximum effort to look after its own **security**.

* Fortunately our present relations with our neighbours on the fundamentals of **security** are so good as to render this a somewhat theoretical question.

* -In rising to speak in the Estimates debate on health and social **security** I am mindful of the importance of this area to the Government.

* The social **security** and welfare budget is something like $3,44 lm of a total budget of $ 16,274m, which is 21 per cent of the total budget.

* In this respect I am referring not only to the money which we have seen spent in the last couple of months, at a time when the unemployment figures are rising, on a scheme to relieve the unemployment situation but also to the countless millions of dollars paid out in unemployment benefit through the Department of Social **Security** for which the country gets nothing in return.

* I suggest that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  should investigate ways and means of providing benefits for our communities in return for the moneys paid out in unemployment benefit.

* What **security** can others who need funds have in the future?

* They have no **security** whatsoever.

* What is needed above all else for Mount Lyell and Queenstown in order to provide the necessary **security** for the people of that region is higher copper prices.

* Where are they not only when it means getting money in the form of grants rather than loans for the people of Tasmania but also when it matters in achieving a more expansionary economic policy so that we will see higher copper prices and we will have some **security** for people in that area?

* Tamper unnecessarily with that system and one tampers with the **security** of ordinary Australians.

* In such a context vague talks on zones of peace have become not only highly improbable and impractical but also downright dangerous in the context of the **security** of Australia's vulnerable western coastline.

* I commend the Government's support of the United States' development of a base at 
Social **Security**: Reciprocal Agreements with Malta (Question No.

* 4638) 
Were there any amounts at that period paid to anyone such as **security** agents; if so, what were the amounts paid and the services provided.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 May 1979: 
How many (a) temporary and (b) permanent staff are currently located at the Department of Social **Security** offices at: 
Are Buddabuddoo people pooling social **security** income to buy farm equipment.

* The major conclusions of the Board of Inquiry were that various procedures relating to **security** of aircraft and hangars at the Naval Air Station were unsatisfactory .

* The aircraft in the hangar could not be securely  locked as  they were not fitted with approved **security** locks; 
What a delicate word to use, but I shall come back to that -  from outside the hangar, and the locks on the doors were not of an approved **security** type; 
As I understand newspaper reports, the manipulation he referred to consisted of using a broom handle to toss the lock open.

* This is a most curious set of **security** arrangements for one of the key defence establishments in this country.

* Such is the complex nature of the **security**.

* The Minister is a man who makes a profession so often of being a stern patriot in defence of the **security** of this country.

* Paragraph 393 (c) states: the offices and stores within the hanger were not secure as they were not fitted with approved **security** locks, nor were their keys returned on a secure keyboard; 
Apparently we are now going to run our armed Services on some sort of honour system.

* Paragraph 393 (e) states: the hangar should have been protected by **security** alarms.

* Although installation had been proposed in December 1973 and the need agreed, it had not been effected by the time of the fire; 
Presumably the tea lady knew more about the functioning of the Nowra base than did the people supposed to be in charge of the administration and operation of **security** arrangements there.

* Paragraph 394 also states: 
the procedures relating to **security** patrols were unsatisfactory in that the actual arrangements were not the arrangements ordered, and that the more experienced patrolmen did not carry out rounds of the required frequency or duration, and 
That is sheer neglect and laziness not just on the part of the people who neglected to perform those duties but also on the part of the people in senior positions at that base who were supposed to ensure that those duties were carried out.

* It seems to me that, as a simple principle, the Defence Services would apply some unexpected random checking procedure so that from time to time unexpected checks could be made of the standard of **security** at armed services bases throughout this country.

* I turn to page 5 of the report where, under 'Conclusions', paragraph 396 states: 
That the various proposals to enhance the **security** of the Air Station were not put into effect, we attribute to a combination of several causes.

* It reveals an absence of **security** and shows that people are able to jig open with a broom handle the door of the main hangar containing these aircraft comprising a large section of the Fleet Air Arm preparedness.

* It is apparent to me from the report of the Board of Inquiry that it clearly inferred that there are other authorities who bear considerable responsibility in this matter who remained indifferent to submissions about the need for adequate fire-fighting equipment and who established higher priorities than giving adequate attention to the needs of the **security** of the Nowra naval base.

* Let us not be under any misapprehension as to the lack of **security** at the Nowra naval base.

* Are they the top brass in the Navy who wanted more and better presentable capital equipment and were prepared to make that their priority at the expense of adequate firefighting and **security** equipment at the Nowra base?

* **Security** arrangements for all defence establishments in Australia; 
That goes nowhere near as far as all the other matters to which I referred.

* The **security** of this country cannot stand that sort of savage blow against its preparedness.

* As there is no other facility available for me within the procedures of the House other than giving notice at a later date I move: 
**Security** arrangements for all defence establishments in Australia; 
It was his fate, of course, going with the 8th Division to Malaya, to be taken prisoner and to be held by the Japanese.

* Those of us who sat with him in the Parliament and in Cabinets are well aware of his tremendously wide interest in what he conceived to be the basic welfare and **security** of the country.

* It contains nothing that would threaten national **security**.

* I do not think that it requires a lower **security** rating than it does in Australia.

* Most of those questions- the present Minister for Defence did not hold that portfolio at the time- were put aside on the ground that they concerned confidential or **security** information.

* The information in the answers had been refused to this Parliament because of **security**.

* Secrecy and the over-use of **security** breeds troubles for the departments which use it.

* I make the other point that the significance of defence to this country, to its **security** and to the.

* I am concerned that such reports have already been issued because I believe that  Mr Justice  Hope went into these matters with a great deal of care and a greaf deal of concern for the civil liberties of Australians, as one would expect, and I would believe that was one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition, in his time, in government appointed  Mr Justice  Hope to examine Australia's **security** intelligence services- not just ASIO but the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Division.

* It needs to be emphasised that in the fourth report concerning ASIO  Mr Justice  Hope's basic finding was that Australia needs and should have a **security** intelligence service to investigate and provide intelligence about threats to the internal **security** of the nation.

* His  Honour stated: 
I find that Australia faces and has faced, or may face, threats to its internal **security** and that ASIO should investigate espionage, active measures, subversion, sabotage, terrorism, the organisation in Australia of or assistance for violent political activity in foreign countries.

* The Government has no doubt that a more effective and efficient ASIO is of fundamental importance to Australia's internal **security** just as it has no doubt that it needs ASIS and the Defence Signals Division, as the judge also strongly recommended.

* We praise and thank  Mr Justice  Hope for his great concern to strike a proper balance between the need to respond decisively to threat to Australia's **security** and to preserve individual freedom.

* Therefore there is the question as to whether some future Labor Administration- if the Labor Party ever had an opportunity to be in government- would accept those findings or do what some of its members want to do, that is destroy the **security** intelligence services which Australia so sorely needs.

* I claim to have been misrepresented yesterday at question time by the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Birrell)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The Government's approach to social **security** matters is also exemplified by the date on which the benefits proposed in this legislation are to commence- 13 May 1976.

* The honourable member for Sturt, of course, is inclined to think that basically all is well in the social **security** system.

* Our social **security** system is the inherintance of the past.

* As one compares the benefits in the repatriation system with the benefits in the social **security** system one sees the anomalies that flow.

* No one doubts the intense interest of the honourable member for Oxley in social **security** and the welfare of pensioners and disadvantaged people.

* Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Government adopted a sensible approach to try to ease any difficulty which could arise as a result of the change to the means test.

* The long term program that has been developed by the Department of Social **Security** in respect to capital assistance over the next 3 years will, I am sure, go a long way towards overcoming some of the deficiencies that exist at the present time.

* I will refer some of the detailed points raised by honourable members to the Minister for Social **Security** in another place.

* Social **Security** Act which enable the Department to postpone benefit payments where a person is voluntarily unemployed.

* to (6) All aspects of the proposed closures including the question of **security** during emergencies and the effect on local employment have been considered carefully, and Telecom does not propose to depart from its long standing policy of progressive conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working, resulting in a gradual decline in the level of manual assistance.

* By the widespread use of automatic alternative routing techniques, and the establishment of manual assistance at the most strategic locations, maximum **security** within the network is achieved.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: 
What was the amount of welfare services provided through the Department of Social **Security** within the electoral divisions of Leichhardt, Herbert, Kennedy and Dawson during each of the years 1973-74 to 1976-77, inclusive, and what were the categories in which they were paid.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: 
1 ) How many farmers registered in each Social **Security** Regional Office received unemployment benefits during (a) 1978 and the period (b) 1 January to31 May 1979.

* For that reason, since the major withdrawal of British forces from this area, Australia has entered into an agreement not only with the United Kingdom but also with other small countries of the region for our mutual **security** - the Five Power Agreement.

* If one is not to neglect the very **security** of one's country one has to take into account the actual realities of the situ ation and not as one would wish them to be.

* It is no good having the most gold plated social services policy, health policy, education policy or any other domestic policies if in our anxiety to improve these fields we neglect the very foundation of the country's **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Under this Scheme, now administered by the Department of Social **Security**, a voluntary welfare agency may, if it meets certain criteria, be given a direct grant for the employment of a social worker to work among immigrants.

* The Government has embraced China, it has insulted the United States of America and it has raided the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* He also said that these proposals- are to give the industry some **security** against price fluctuation without distorting the underlying trend in market prices.

* So they should be, because then basic aim is to bring **security** against price fluctuations.

* This wheat stabilisation scheme will provide **security** not only for those directly involved in growing wheat but also for those indirectly involved.

* I know that a number of wellintentioned but rather ill-informed people are going around saving that by cutting out a nuclear program of peaceful development some kind of **security** is being given against nuclear war.

* There is no restriction upon mining and supply of uranium which can give the slightest **security** against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

* The plan is directed to what we want, namely, the **security** of the world from nuclear war.

* At that particular meeting representatives of over 90 governments strongly condemned hijacking and considered **security** measures to prevent criminal action on aircraft in future.

* A list of **security** measures at airports was drawn up at that time.

* The tenor of my remarks on the question of Japanese military efforts outside Japan was that the Japanese themselves had made it clear that they were not contemplating any sort of a military role beyond their own territory and thai their contribution to ' regional stability and **security** would be limited to the economic field.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on taking the opportunity to introduce these pension increases just about a month ahead of schedule.

* I hope that the Minister for Social **Security** can answer this when he is summing up.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** what he intends to do about handicapped children.

* I would like the Minister for Social **Security** to say whether his Government has considered the possibility of introducing a special benefit for handicapped children, reducing the age qualification for receipt of the invalid pension or introducing some other means by which these people can be accommodated.

* In February the Acting Minister for Social **Security**, in response to a letter from me last year concerning the payment of pension cheques into bank accounts, said that that matter had been accepted in principle but there were administrative difficulties to overcome.

* Honourable members will have just received a Treasury paper on taxation containing a table which shows that, of 23 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries studied, Australia's percentage of taxation to gross national product is the tenth highest if social **security** contributions are excluded and, if they are included, Australia ranks eighteenth in 23 countries.

* -Has the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** seen Press reports indicating that there is some confusion in Tasmania over the way in which claims for unemployment benefit from farmers are being processed and whether it is necessary for such claims io go to Canberra for approval if primary producers .are engaged in industries other than beef, dairying Or fruit?

* In addition, there is a crucial need for a uniform companies and **security** law.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
It is true that like most of us, and like Oliver Twist long ago, we would have liked more.

* The level of attainment in all three- that is, in the United States, Japan and the European Economic Community- sets not an upper limit but a base from which, hopefully, we can maintain in the future a level of access which will give to agricultural exporters in particular a **security** which they have never before enjoyed.

* The minimal access that has been secured through these multilateral trade negotiations does give to Australian exporters a **security** which I think is going to help to restore something like a correct perspective between the different sectors of the Australian community.

* The Government strongly supports the objectives of disarmament both because disarmament contributes to regional and global **security** and the improvement of relations between States, and because real and significant measures of disarmament make possible the freeing of resources which can be then applied to economic and social development.

* Increased numbers of people served by unemployment benefits administration in the Departments of Social **Security** and Employment and Industrial Relations.

* In marked contrast to the Fraser Government's savage repression of employment in vital areas of the public sector, stands its extravagant use of committees of inquiry and task forces whose reports are usually commissioned to enable the Government to pass the buck for its disinterest in positive and compassionate proposals in the areas of employment, health and social **security**.

* The problem with this Bill is not that it is concerned with efficiency and economy but that, given this Government's record, it will be used as an instrument for pursuing further false economies, for justifying staff cuts in areas such as social **security**, employment and health.

* In view of the fact that a person who incurs a debt as a member of a partnership remains liable for that debt after he has left the partnership, and that directors of corporations which are creditors of failed partnerships have a duty to their shareholders to pursue all persons who were partners in the partnership at the time the debt was incurred to seek satisfaction of that debt, I ask whether the honourable member's Bill will ensure that white collar crime of this type would be more difficult to perpetrate in the future and that persons who deceive the public in **security** transactions are brought to justice.

* One would have expected too that in this Budget the opportunity would have been taken to define a broad programme not only involving social **security** payments but actual welfare services and mobilising the resources available in the community against poverty in the community.

* This calls, of course, not only for the provision of adequate social **security** payments but the development of welfare services in the community; an appreciation that a complex of services has to be mobilised and integrated within the community to combat this problem.

* The Labor Party's programme is for national superannuation, national compensation and national health insurance as the first phase of a comprehensive scheme of social **security**.

* We will be backing up all that we are proposing for social **security** with the development of regionalised welfare services.

* It is all very well to say that Ministers should give evidence to committees on policy matters, that public servants should give evidence on fact and that matters which are confidential for reasons of **security** or because they represent the confidential advice of a public servant to his Minister should not be disclosed by public servants.

* matters relating to defence, internal **security**, confidential communications with other countries and with the States 
Documents that are given one of the usual **security** ratings as 'Confidential ', 'Secret', or 'Top Secret' would normally be included under one of the categories in paragraph 19 above.

* (Note: It does not follow that documents without a formal **security** classification may not be the subject of a claim of privilege.

* The classes of contributors are pregnant women and uninsured people who become recipients of social **security** unemployment, sickness or special benefits.

* I shall turn now to the group of uninsured people who become recipients of social **security** unemployment, sickness or special benefits.

* I noted in the latest annual report of the Department of Social **Security** that the total number of nursing home beds provided had risen from nearly 78 700 to nearly 85 300.

* I am sure that honourable members remember the period in which we were a government and the constant criticism to which we were subjected, and frequently the very bitter, personal condemnation of Ministers for Social **Security** in the Labor Government by the profit makers in the nursing homes about how tough we were and about how we were depriving the aged of beds.

* The tables are based upon statistics in successive annual reports of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Another aspect I wish to raise is the overall achievement in the field of social **security** and welfare by the Labor Government.

* In 197 1-72 when we came into office the percentage of gross domestic product spent on social **security** and welfare was 4.4.

* years I was Minister for Social **Security** to realise the enormous complexities and difficulties of introducing a simple guaranteed scheme with the vast range of different forms of benefits which are available and which ought to be overtaken by a more simplified, adequate system of guaranteed income.

* The office of the Minister for Social **Security**, and the Minister is in another place, is unable to clarify a little conundrum here.

* It hopes that some **security** will be given to this industry which is important to defence, and it trusts that the Bill will have a speedy passage.

* -We are discussing clause 5 ( 1 ) (b) of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill to which the Opposition has moved an amendment which seeks to insert the word 'unlawful' before the word 'activities'.

* The clause at present provides that activities regarded as subversion will include:  activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth; 
The Opposition seeks to insert the word 'unlawful' before the word 'activities 'so that before the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is able to regard an activity as a matter requiring attention that activity should be unlawful.

* For example, there has to be an intention to obstruct the defence forces in the performance of their duty, not just some activity that they may be engaged in but activity which is for the purposes of **security** or defence of the Commonwealth.

* Therefore the point is that although these activities may not be strictly unlawful under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, nonetheless the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation may feel that it is obliged to build up a file on those engaged in these activities.

* Within that context, I think it would be essential for a **security** intelligence organisation to be able to make a determination of its own as to whether activities, which under the statutory arrangements were lawful or unlawful, were directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth.

* I cannot imagine that the Defence Act or the various laws relating to the defence forces would allow members of the general population to obstruct, hinder or interfere with the performance of those forces when they were engaging in activities for the purposes of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth, without deeming them to be acting illegally.

* I would not want to have a situation in which a person employed by the **Security** Intelligence Organisation had to think about 400 times whether a particular activity was strictly legal or illegal before that person observed it as something which was potentially subversive.

* Under that decision, if it were enacted by a Labor government, the **Security** Intelligence Organisation would be quite restrained specifically by this clause from taking note of activities which could be absolutely subversive because of the particular quirk of the government of the day as to what it regarded as legal or illegal.

* What he does not like is any action of this Parliament to decide that we should reinforce the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to protect the members of smaller unions and give job **security**.

* They want job **security**.

* They are saying: 'Does the legislation of the 
Government give me more chance of job **security** or not?'

* What is more, the Opposition has not woken up to this fact- the electorate knows it will increase job **security**.

* In addition to communications, the Post Office provides part of the machinery of the Social **Security** System and many other kinds of business are transacted at Post Office counters.

* This Bill complements the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill 1979 and is consistent with the amendments moved by the Government to the Customs Bill 1979.

* The Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** recommended that ASIO's powers of interception should be extended to interception of information passing over all telecommunications systems and this Bill so provides.

* Recognising, however, that somewhat different considerations apply to interceptions for the purpose of inquiring into narcotic offences than apply in relation to **security** matters, the Bill provides for warrants to be issued by a judge of the Federal Court or a State or Territory supreme court authorising interceptions for these purposes.

* The Bill represents an essential complement to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill.

* Adequate provision for the **security** of Australia is a fundamental objective of the Government.

* They would be capable of further timely expansion to deter and if necessary counter any threats to the **security** of our national interests should the need arise.

* There is nothing equivocal about the Government's commitment to Australia's national **security**.

* This, like our recreational program, will cost money, but not nearly as much as our social **security** or health programs.

* Firstly, the Party changed its policy by deleting the word 'crucial' so that it is clear that it no longer regards the ANZUS Treaty as crucial in respect of Australia's **security**.

* There is a sharp divergence of opinion and I suggest that the current policy of the Opposition is one which is not in the best interests of the **security** of Australia.

* In addition I present an outline of that report prepared by the Commission of Inquiry together with a statement by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Wheeldon)  on the report.

* If the Department of Labour and Immigration has this information, it will be in a much better position to advise applicants for adult retraining as to what training will best guarantee their future **security** of employment.

* After all, if training more building operatives means less job **security** for the workers already in the industry, who can blame them?

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 10 April 1978: 
Have any Australian intelligence agencies within his Department resumed contacts with the South African Bureau of State **Security**.

* The new thinking in Asian countries amounts to a questioning or in some cases a rejection of the belief that the **security** of individual nations can be protected and national interests promoted on the basis of alignment with great powers and the cold war style of confrontation and containment of communism.

* For some time, a realisation that the approach to national **security** has been too negative has been growing.

* The enormous expenditure on defence - (According to the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1970 it was $US204,000m or the equivalent of one year's income of the entire population of the developing countries - has in most cases complicated national **security** problems rather than offer solutions to them.

* Despite great effort and expenditures, few countries would boast that a truly effective **security** system has yet been attained.

* At the same time, the belief is that good prospects exist for a new, stable balance in international relations, offering in the form of interlocking relationships, perhaps with super-power guarantees, an alternative to heavy defence expenditure as a measure to a better and more realistic **security**, and a future basis for disarmament and arms control.

* Although there has been a perceptible change in recent years, since the end of the Second World War the preoccupation of Australian Governments has been the search for **security** against external attack.

* Also, if taken too seriously, a treaty such as ANZUS can create a false sense of **security**, in that the real basis for the commitment of one country to another - close friendship and the identity of interests - may be ignored or treated too lightly.

* Political developments in Asian countries have been followed closely by the Government, but its paramount concern has been to determine whether Australian **security** has been endangered, whether communist objectives have been furthered and what defence measures should be taken to deter a possible threat.

* This means the undertaking of more purposeful steps to acquire a deeper understanding of the countries of the region and to participate with them in their search for greater co-operation, such as the search for a system of collective **security** that would obviate the need for heavy defence expenditures.

* I think that the honourable member for Griffith must realise that within the Department of Social **Security** there are people who probably are unaware of some of the massive social problems with which this Government is faced, with which governments of the past have been faced and with which governments of the future will be faced.

* It is only now that he is starting to mouth cliches that relate to some form of **security** and to notions of strategic bases that should have been accepted and analysed by this Government before today.

* One is a matter for the consideration of the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones),  one is for myself and the third and fourth matters are for the attention of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Perhaps I might refer briefly to the question affecting the Minister for Social **Security**, although I have no doubt that the Minister will provide the honourable member for Henty with a suitable reply.

* However, I am sure that the Minister for 'Social **Security** will sympathetically consider the honourable member's request.

* I acknowledge that the honourable member for Henty has always shown some interest in questions of social **security**; I would want to concede that.

* This was the proposition that the internal **security** of 
Papua New Guinea was more a matter for soldiers than for police.

* We sought the best and most effective ways possible of building up the police so that they and not the defence forces would play this role- I think it is a role that the police must play in any democracy- of the control of the internal **security** situation.

* I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong is aware of the statement made in August 1973 by  Mr Maori  Kiki, who is now the Papua New Guinea Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade, when he said that the Papua New Guinea Government has repeatedly stressed its view that the Papua New Guinea Defence Force should be used as a last resort for the maintenance of internal **security**.

* Let me tell the honourable member for Perth, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the entire Australian nation that we will fight this scheme continually and positively, and in the end we will defeat it because it is a bad scheme.

* We all know that the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  will not cost his health scheme.

* The entire social **security** and welfare, and housing expenditure by the Commonwealth comes to $2,975m.

* This health scheme would drag away all of that expenditure on those items of social **security** and welfare and of housing.

* The man who runs the Ontario health scheme- nowadays Canada is the criterion for all things, and Ontario is the place from where a lot of this health scheme was taken- said this: 
The honourable member for Perth and the Minister for Social **Security** said that the Government scheme is not so bad because if one does not like it one can insure oneself for treatment in a private hospital.

* They are seriously at risk because of the crude protectionist policies adopted by the Government I do not quibble with the concern expressed by Government spokesmen about job **security**, given the state of the economy.

* I remember as Minister for Social **Security** the distress with which I discovered that one of the highest levels of rural poverty existed in the northern rivers of New South Wales, and had existed there in the dairy industry for many years, within the electorate of the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and indeed within your electorate,  Mr Deputy Chairman.

* The Australian Government's support for Israel's right to exist and its attitude towards the territories occupied by Israel are both encompassed by our endorsement of United Nations **Security** Council Resolution 242 of 22 November 1967.

* ensure that baggage, cargo and mail are loaded only in accordance with the company's specified **security** procedures; 
Air Navigation Regulations No.

* The Secretary has exercised powers conferred on him by these Regulations to require the domestic airlines to observe **security** procedures at airports.

* It provides that an operator of an international airline service to or from Australia shall not cause or permit an aircraft used in that service to fly over Australian territory or land at or take off from an Australian airport unless an aviation **security** program prepared and submitted by the operator has been approved by the Secretary and that approval is in force.

* As to regional devolution of office representation of the Department of Social **Security**, that is currently under consideration.

* However, I suggest that the honourable member and anyone else who seems to believe that poverty can adequately be attacked simply by setting up an office of the Department of Social **Security** are badly self deceived.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Briefly, let me say in reply to the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr Ruddock)  that these matters are under consideration by my Government and by the States concerned.

* The **security** of dangerous drugs is the main consideration which exercised the minds of Ministers for Health in their conference when they discussed this matter earlier in the year, and no doubt they will be discussing it again at their meeting in April this year.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** been drawn to the public statements made by  Dr Hames  and  Dr Fischer  of Western Australia that they were withdrawing from the pensioner medical service because of intrusion and interference by the Australian Government in the manner in which they practise?

* That this House calls on the Government to reintroduce immediately six-monthly indexation of social **security** and repatriation benefits.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  will purchase two VIP jets- and rightly so, I suppose, for **security** reasons- at a cost of $17m and $20m.

* That restoration of provisions of the Social **Security** Act that applied prior to the 1 978-79 Budget is of vital concern to offset the rising cost of goods and services.

* Possibly the Reef is the biggest untapped reserve for commercial fishing and, as a result, we have foreign intrusion into these areas which is a danger not only to the defence but also to the **security** of this country.

* The other aspect in connection with the Reef that has come in for criticism, especially from this House, certainly in this decade, has been the lack of **security** and the fact that Taiwanese fishermen and other foreign intruders are able to get onto the Reef.

* We are suggesting that it is about time that **security** of tenure was available to people who do not get the so-called **security** of tenure through home ownership or so-called home ownership through the process of purchasing a house which is, as the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  suggested, increasingly taking a greater and greater proportion of people's lives and more and more of their resources.

* We believe that the people who do not opt for that form of tenure, the people who are prepared to rent, ought to be given some kind of **security**.

* When they are on low incomes, they ought to be able to depend both on **security** and on a measure of support from the Government.

* by leave- I wish to inform the House of decisions the Government has taken about the organisation of the intelligence and **security** services in Australia.

* These decisions follow the Government's study of one of the reports of the Royal Commissioner on Intelligence and **Security**,  Mr Justice  Hope, which he recently presented to the Governor-General.

* There is always difficulty in publicly discussing matters of **security** and intelligence.

* The Government however, intends to make public those parts of  Mr Justice  Hope's reports which can be revealed without prejudice to national **security**.

* Honourable members will recall that  Mr Justice  Hope was appointed the Royal Commissioner by the previous Government to make recommendations on intelligence and **security** services the nation should have available to it.

* The fundamental finding of the Royal Commissioner is that Australia needs a highly professional system of intelligence and **security** services, and that this need is now more apparent than ever before.

* The Commission's findings affirm the growing importance of intelligence and **security** services.

* Ministerial Committee should be supported by a committee of Permanent Heads, comprising Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet as Chairman, Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Secretary of the Department of Defence, Chief of Defence Force Staff, Secretary to the Treasury, Director-General of Office of National Assessments and the DirectorGeneral of **Security**.

* It will be able to co-operate with other agencies, for example, the Joint Intelligence Agency and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, in the production of joint reports and assessments.

* However, the responsibility for existing agencies in the community- for example, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and the Joint Intelligence Organisation- will remain with the present Ministers.

* Secondly, honourable members will note that the Royal Commissioner has stressed the need to achieve a bi-partisan attitude on these important questions of intelligence and **security** which affect the national interest.

* Matters of intelligence and **security** are of fundamental national concern.

* The decisions announced today demonstrate the Government's determination to see that Australia has the best possible system of coordination and control of intelligence and **security** services and that high quality intelligence assessments on political, strategic and economic matters are available to government.

* He has undertaken a thorough and painstaking study of the **security** and intelligence arrangements in this country and has presented a very valuable and creative report.

* We have been assured by and have ascertained for ourselves from the previous program of home savings grants that in this way the cost of housing is reduced over the life span of the occupant and that it provides an absolute **security** of tenure.

* The acquisition of a valuable asset does ensure this **security**.

* Not only does it ensure a **security** whereby people have a psychological outlook that is somewhat different because of that **security** but also it provides a value **security**, a financial **security**, a place that is one's own, an asset that can be called on in times of dire circumstance.

* The proposal comprises: An operations building to accommodate area approach control, flight service centre, the necessary control equipment and training facilities; a services building containing a transformer for the provision of primary power, essential power generation and air conditioning plant; an air traffic control tower accommodating an elevated control cabin, support control equipment and essential power and air conditioning plant; and associated site works, car parks, roads and engineering services, sewerage and drainage and **security** fencing to the operations building and services building area.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 May 1979: 

 More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMr SCHOLES (Corio) (5.32)-The Opposition raises this matter because it is of considerable concern.

* Some of the answers given by Ministers directly involved- I instance the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and her answers in this Parliament and in correspondence- also reflect a similar position.

* The Department of Social **Security**, which obviously is the Department dealing most directly with urgent cases, is almost crippled because of the indiscriminate application of staff ceilings.

* Members of the staff of Department of Social **Security** offices are overworked to the extent that quite obviously mistakes must happen.

* In the case of the Department of Social **Security** we have this sort of situation: In answer to a question by  Senator Grimes  the Minister for Social **Security** indicated that she was not aware of any problems within the Department of Social **Security** in South Australia.

* We all know that restraint is needed by governments- all governments- to 'restore private enterprise to some semblance of its former self, to reduce the size of the public sector in order to make room for private investment and to divert resources back to areas which are crucial to the long-term prosperity and **security** of the nation and to employment.

* Even the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  acknowledged this recently when he said: 
The Ranger joint venturers have pointed out that section 14 of the Atomic Energy Act, as it presently stands, does not provide them with adequate **security** of tenure.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
and (5) There are serious difficulties in attempting to provide valid and reliable international comparisons of unemployment benefit rates.

* The International Labour Office has stated ('Social **Security** for the Unemployed ', 1 976 page 18): 
These difficulties are compounded for comparisons between countries with social insurance systems providing partly or wholly earnings-related benefits and Australia's social **security** system with its non-contributory flat-rate benefits.

* The Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960 provides that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is the only Government body that the AttorneyGeneral may authorise to intercept telephone calls and enumerates the circumstances in which interception of telephone calls can be authorised.

* Section 6 of that Act empowers the Attorney-General, at the request of the Director-General of **Security**, to authorise the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to intercept calls: over a telephone service used, or reasonably suspected of being used, in activities prejudicial to the **security** of the Commonwealth.

* if the interception is likely to assist the Organisation in its function of obtaining intelligence relevant to the **security** of the Commonwealth.

* In accordance with the general practice of successive Governments I do not propose to provide information concerning the operations of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The adequacy or otherwise of physical **security** measures to protect telephone communications installations must be measured against the assessed threat.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has been blamed for a Watergate-style break-in at the Labor Party's national headquarters in Canberra just after the 1 975 election.

* **Security** sources in Canberra say ASIO agents entered the premises at night and forced a filing cabinet crammed with documents from the office of the former Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam.

* The politics of this country have reached a pathetic stage when the Prime Minister has to resort to the use of an internal **security** organisation to try to undermine his political opponents. 
)

* Social **Security** and Attorney-General's was established in March 1977 to prepare a paper on aspects of unemployment benefit payments.

* As the honourable member will be aware, on 30 March 1977 the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and the Minister for Social **Security** announced the establishment of, and the terms of reference for, an inquiry into unemployment benefit policy and administration to be carried out by  Dr David  Myers, former Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
A census of homeless people has not been undertaken in Australia.

* This is the finding of the Working Party on Homeless Men and Women which reported to the Minister for Social **Security** in June 1973.

* The Department of Social **Security** is planning to collect information throughout Australia on the numbers of homeless persons in need of assistance, as pan of an evaluation program.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 April 1978: 
1 ) How many persons have been employed by the Department of Social **Security** in each quarter in each State in (a) the pensions section, (b) the family allowances section and (c) the unemployment and sickness benefit section since I January 1975.

* How many applications for benefits have been processed by the Department of Social **Security** in each quarter in each State in (a) the pensions section, (b) the family allowances section and (c) the unemployment and sickness benefit section since 1 January 1975.

* The Board of Inquiry was convened by the Flag Officer Commanding East Australia Area under the authority of the Naval Defence Act and was directed to examine the **security** arrangements and fire prevention measures which existed before the fire, how the fire was fought and action taken to minimise loss after the fire started, and to make recommendations to prevent a recurrence.

* The Board of Inquiry was assisted by a specialist in fire services and **security** from the Royal Australian Air Force and by experts drawn from a broad spectrum of specialised agencies of Commonwealth, State and local governments.

* The major conclusions of the Board of Inquiry were that the material aspects of **security** of aircraft within the hangar and of the hangar itself were less than adequate; various procedures relating to **security** of aircraft and hangars at the Naval Air Station were unsatisfactory; certain persons did not carry out their **security** duties in accordance with orders; various proposals to enhance the **security** of the Naval Air Station had not been put into effect; the standards of construction of H hangar were below those considered appropriate today for the safe stowage of aircraft; and the response to the alarm was good, the fire could not have been extinguished sooner or more closely confined, the actions taken to fight the fire were sound and many men showed great courage and determination in fighting the fire and removing aircraft to safety.

* As honourable members will see from the paper I have tabled, the Board also drew conclusions on other matters of lesser importance dealing with inadequacies or deficiencies in the administration of **security** and fire protection at the Station.

* Ten officers have been dealt with for their failure to ensure adequate **security** of the Air Station and its valuable assets and for not exercising proper supervision of duty **security** personnel on the night of the fire.

* Immediate steps were taken to improve the **security** protection of naval aircraft and the base complex.

* The following specific actions have been taken: 
**Security** of aircraft has been considerably improved by employing sentries in hangars, by more effective mobile patrols equipped with two-way radios, by more frequent random checks by senior Station officers and duty officers, and by the introduction of guard dog teams.

* The **security** of the hangars has been upgraded to the extent practicable at this stage; doors can no longer be opened by outside devices, all padlocks have been checked in good order and the barring of external windows will be completed this month.

* Some $43,000 has been expended or committed on works to improve **security** since the fire.

* In addition, items have been included in the works program for this financial year to provide for improved **security** to a number of areas in the Station, principally to extend the facilities for the introduction of two new fire tenders, to improve the perimeter road, to provide a flammable stowage for one hangar, and to improve **security** and fire protection in a number of other buildings.

* Consideration is being given to a number of further measures including provision of additional **security** fencing, illumination and **security** alarms for other sensitive areas, illumination of the aircraft hardstanding adjacent to the hangars, and renewal of lighting in some hangars using flame-proof fitments.

* Considerable improvement in the Station's **security** awareness has been reported.

* It could be argued that fault lay in the system where physical improvements to **security** that had been requested were not provided.

* These points do not excuse the unsatisfactory state of **security** which existed at the Naval Air Station at the time of the fire and I do not condone or underestimate the faults and inadequacies that this inquiry has exposed.

* The most significant lesson from this unfortunate affair is that the **security** of valuable defence assets rests primarily in the hands of the users.

* But it is the personal and continual watchfulness of every officer and man that is our foremost defence for the **security** of our assets.

* The Chiefs of the three Services share my views in this regard whole-heartedly, and immediately following the fire they took steps to improve **security** awareness and training on the part of all members of the defence force.

* While the conclusions indicated that there was much that could be done to improve **security** by way of modern protection devices, firefighting equipment and provision of **security** personnel, all these must be weighed against competing demands for limited defence resources of money and manpower.

* That **security** procedures were not properly observed, and in some respects were inadequate, cannot be excused.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* 1 ) It is not possible to answer this question from statistics available to the Department of Social **Security** as the most frequent cases in which benefit payments are terminated are those in which it is found that the claimant has returned to work.

* In a small proportion of cases, payment of benefit is cancelled because the claimant cannot be located after two or more visits to the address he has given and he fails to comply with a written request that he contact the Department of Social **Security**, or for similar reasons.

* -The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman),  the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and honourable members on their side of the House have been looking around in their customary way as they have been doing for so many years for an opportunity to denigrate the health funds in order to promote their particular scheme, conceived in infamy and by a couple of academics.

* I challenge the Minister for Social **Security** to say that the officers of his Department who have had experience with this fund over the years would not acknowledge that this is the best organised, the best run and the most beneficial health fund in Australia.

* The Minister for Social **Security** did not conceive it; his present leader, the Prime Minister, conceived this process of denigrating the health funds in order to promote the great monolithic, compulsory health fund to be run by the Government which the Minister is in the process of foisting on us.

* The other and probably most important purpose in the mind of the Minister for Social **Security** is to use this legislation as a device against the stated decision of the courts of the land which found against him in New South Wales recently.

* I can remember that over the years first of all the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  when he was Leader of the Opposition and followed by the present Minister for Social **Security** when he was the shadow Minister for Health never used to talk about the special account.

* The only thing we heard from the Minister for Social **Security** and from the person who is described as his Leader was the inadequacy of the then Government's contribution to the hospital benefits scheme.

* Time after time the Minister for Social **Security** stood and talked about the $2 a day which was provided as a Commonwealth contribution to the hospital benefits scheme.

* The present Minister for 
Social **Security** knew this.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* We are inclined to argue that everything that happens in a **security** organisation must be taken on trust.

* I draw the attention of the House to some matters which were raised in the Hope report and which ought to be subject to scrutiny in this House, I refer to the question of the appropriate criteria to be applied in **security** matters.

* Mr Justice  Hope stated in paragraph 266 of his fourth report, volume I: 
For organizational reasons it may be necessary, and it is appropriate, that criteria for **security** checking purposes should be formulated.

* Thirdly, they should reflect **security**, and not other, considerations.

* But, in making **security** assessments, the DG is concerned with human beings, who are so infinitely various in all respects that a rigid system of criteria to establish loyalty and reliability, allowing no exceptions, must be unjust.

* It has been said that in **security** cases the nation must be given the benefit of any doubt.

* It is sufficient reason to overturn accepted norms as to the **security** of mail, the **security** of telephones and other elements that we take for granted in private life because the secrecy experts have decided that it is necessary that, for reasons of State it has to be and we simply have to accept it; ASIO has its reasons and they must not be questioned?

* I refuse to hand over my judgment, finite though it is, and the collective judgment of this Parliament, finite and imperfect as it is, to another organisation made up of human beings, even if it claims to be perfect and even if it says that the reasons that it operates in such a way are essential for national **security**.

* I draw the attention of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to the advertisement which, in the words of the honourable member for Prospect, who I believe is the secretary of the Government's health committee, is plainly fraudulent.

* It is due to be introduced on 1 July and everybody who knows anything about the Department of Health, the Department of Social **Security** and the problems facing the Government knows that is would be only with intense difficulty that the scheme could be up and running by 1 July.

* (b) 42 of these computers are operated by Departmental staff, 14 by staff employed by the Health Insurance Commission and 8 by the Department of Social **Security**, (c) None, (d) None.

* Honeywell H7I6 computers- Transmission and dissection of Social **Security**, Health and Health Insurance Commission data entry traffic between their data entry central/regional computers.

* Eight of the Honeywell computers are operated by Department of Social **Security** staff.

* Department of Social **Security** 
Depanment of Social **Security** 
* **Security** door locks and personnel checks control the access of all persons to and from the control computer sites, in addition to inbuilt program control to prevent and/or detect data corruption and unauthorised access to computer files.

* Authorised personnel of the Department of Social **Security** who operate 8 of the computers on behalf of the Department.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* 1 ) The Department of Social **Security** does not knowingly grant pensions or benefits to persons who have entered Australia without an entry permit.

* As a consequence it would be exceptional if any Vietnamese people who originally came to Australia as 'unauthorised arrivals' are receiving Social **Security** benefits while not holding entry permits.

* They will not stay unless there is a guarantee about the **security** of tenure and about the fundamental equality of the service in which they elect to teach.

* Australia concluded a reciprocal agreement on social **security** with the United Kingdom on 8th June 1953, and the agreement commenced to operate in 1954.

* Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social **security** .

* But the fact is that migrants who leave Australia, who have earned their pensions here, cannot have social **security** under the present arrangements.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the opinion expressed by the Livestock and Grain Producers ' Association in its submission to the inquiry into quarantine measures by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources that there was no justification for over zealous economy drives and staff limitations when these were considered against the potential massive costs of a breakdown in quarantine **security**.

* If so, what action does he intend to take to prevent such a potentially disastrous breakdown in quarantine **security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 14 November1978: 
What arrangements exist between Australia and New Zealand for the handling of social **security** payments to citizens of one country resident in the other.

* How many New Zealanders are presently receiving social **security** payments in Australia, by state of residence.

* How many Australians are receiving social **security** payments in New Zealand.

* What forms of identification are required for New Zealanders when registering for social **security** benefits.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 21 August 1979: 
How many officers of the Department of Social **Security** in each occupational classification have been involved in the apprehension of persons illegally receiving unemployment benefits in Australia, during each year since 197S.

* What have been the (a) salaries; (b) administrative costs; (c) court costs and (d) other costs to the Department of Social **Security** for the apprehension of persons illegally receiving unemployment benefits in Australia during each of the same years.

* This is an indication of the Government's commitments along with programs about which the community knows-programs that have been delivered during the past year to encourage people to own their homes and to establish the **security** and the base for their children which will provide for the citizens of tomorrow an opportunity for wellbeing and an opportunity to look forward with confidence.

* The difficulties of the last four years have caused a pause in the progress and the **security** of Australia.

* For our young people the challenge will be unlimited and must be seized upon by them to achieve progress, **security** and wellbeing.

* This is a very small sum to ensure the **security** of not just the city of Mount Isa.

* There is no need for me further to strengthen the points of view advocated by them, but 1 wish to participate in this debate for a few minutes to expose one of the neatest tricks of the year concerning Queensland in which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and those who have spoken from the opposite side of the House have deliberately glazed the truth.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 21 November 1978: 
How many officers of the Department of Social **Security**; (a) sought approval; (b) were granted approval and) (c) were refused approval to travel on Concorde aircraft during (i) 1976-77, (ii) 1977-78 and (iii) 1978-79 to date.

* How many officers of the Department of Social **Security** or the Minister's personal staff have travelled on Concorde aircraft without seeking approval.

asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 2 1 August 1979: 
If a contract of life assurance has superimposed upon its terms a set of tax rules entirely different from those existing when the contract was made, those most seriously affected would be the parties to or the beneficiaries under a contract providing for the payment of a sum of money upon a life assured attaining a certain age or upon prior death, i.e., upon those who have made provision for their own personal **security** or that of their family.

* What has to be made clear is that the Government's proposals will disadvantage millions of Australians who have vested their future **security** in schemes of life assurance.

* jeopardises the savings and future **security** or Australians holding life assurance policies; 
Has the Government made efforts to enable the United Nations **Security** Council, of which Australia is presently an elected member, to meet and discuss physical conflict and loss of life on and near  the  Paracel Islands involving China and South Vietnam?

* Social **security** is up by 13.7 per cent; education is up by 16 per cent, despite claims that it has been cut; health spending is up by 1 1 per cent, including 17 per cent in assistance to the aged; funding to local government through the income tax sharing arrangements is increased by 19 per cent; and road funding and payments to the States has increased dramatically.

* the requirements that the Bank should be satisfied that finance would not be otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions and that attention be paid not so much to the **security** that is available but rather to the prospects for success of the proposed venture - is particuarly relevant to travel operators.

* The Committee considers that it is for the good of the public of Australia that the rates of interest on moneys borrowed on the **security** of real estate should be reasonable.

* Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Parliament should have power, concurrently with the States, to make laws with respect to rates of interest and other charges payable in connection with loans obtained upon the mortgage or other **security** of land.

* The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Government both support the long standing resolutions which have been passed on this matter unanimously by the United Nations in the General Assembly and in the **Security** Council.

* It is a magnificent base and helps to bring **security** to this troubled area.

* What he said is clearly a criticism of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and of the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  because it was quite open to them to have the Bill and the papers ready for introduction into this House on an earlier occasion than this, but they were unable to do so.

* But there has developed a situation which indicates a very deep difference between the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* It began in February of last year when the Minister for Social **Security** said that he had told his Department to adopt a new philosophy towards social welfare payments and gave the direction to his Department that merely because an employer did not find a registered applicant's appearance acceptable, it was not sufficient reason to debar him from unemployment benefits.

* Mr Cameron said he and the Social **Security** Minister,  Mr Hayden,  were examining the conditions under which people got unemployment benefits.

* The other part of this particular matter involves criticism by the Minister for Social **Security** of the Victorian Premier.

* On 20 March, only a day or two ago, the Minister for Social **Security** in this House said: 
He went on to attack the Victorian Premier, but to know what was really in the mind of the Minister for Social **Security** instead of his comments applying to the Victorian Premier they should apply to the Minister for Labour.

* This is a curious business because on 27 February a letter was written by the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  on behalf of the Minister for Social **Security** to a colleague of mine on this side of the House.

* In that letter he admitted quite plainly - I quote: 
The Government obviously is concerned that some people are abusing the system yet the Minister for Social **Security** said that there is no evidence of that at all.

* W. G. Hayden, Minister for Social **Security**, have set up a joint working party.

* Why has the Minister for Social **Security** agreed to this proposal if there is no evidence at all of such abuse?

* The Minister for Labour has made a statement which, I suggest with a great deal of respect, has incurred the hostility of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* After some discussion with and representations to the Minister for Labour he passed the man's claim on for reference to and payment by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Department of Labour accepted the claim but the Minister for Social **Security** promptly rejected it.

* Possibly one might describe that as a reverse kind of situation because generally it is the Minister for Social **Security**- 
I am referring to the matter of a difference between the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Labour.

* On these occasions it is the Minister for Labour who has shown public responsibility and the Minister for Social **Security** who has shown public irresponsibility for attacking the Victorian Premier in the way he did, but basically attacking his own colleague for his colleague's statement of a few days before.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 24 May 1978: 
1 ) Has there been a change in the role of the Department of Social **Security** in the payment of United Kingdom age pensions.

* Can the Minister indicate whether many cases of hardship have been reported, resulting from changes in arrangements between the UK Government and the Department of Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) How many officers of the Department of Social **Security** are engaged in the administration of the Australian Assistance Plan (a) on a full-time basis and (b) on a part-time basis.

* How many (a) filled and (b) vacant positions are there in the administrative structure of the Australian Assistance Plan apart from positions in the Department of Social **Security**.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) How many citizens in the electoral division of Evans are estimated or known to be receiving (a) pensions and (b) other forms of social **security** benefits.

* How many (a) females and (b) males in part ( 1 ) are receiving such social **security** benefits, and will the Minister provide a break up of each of the various categories of benefits received.

* Do all Ministers as members of the Cabinet put themselves in a position where they must have available to them **security** information?

* If he is unwilling to take this course will he personally decide which papers have a **security** content and not distribute these papers to Ministers unwilling to have their staffs cleared?

* Here the Government has started out by asking itself the question: 'What can we do to weaken Australia's defence forces, her **security** and her alliances with her traditional allies?'

* He is described in a United States Senate -hearing on **security** as an agent for KGB, the- Soviet Police.

* But as we glance through this list of decisions announced in the Speech we see more and more that the, guiding light behind many, if not most of them, is mat the Government should be seen by Labor's left wing supporters to be doing those things that undermine our **security** or assist the communists.

* But even worse than this loss of efficiency and morale is the tragic blow to our **security** as a result of the incredible disclosures on our troops in Singapore.

* As a responsible government we had a policy in the field of intelligence that, where national **security** was involved we did not confirm or deny any speculation about defence installations.

* But now the present Prime Minister is rushing in to try to curry favour with some members of the, Press and Labor's left wing by making **security** leaks and disclosures about Australia's defence installations, even though he later admitted that some of the information obtained was extremely useful to Australia.

* The second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was vague, as was the first annual report of the Social Welfare Commission which, incidentally, this Bill seeks to establish although it has already produced an annual report, and also the booklet entitled 'The Australian Assistance Plan'.

* towards abolishing the Department of Social **Security** and other departments.

* They are the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**, who is obviously a strong disciple of Parkinson's law, the first annual report of the Social Welfare Commission, the Australian Assistance Plan compiled by members of the Social Welfare Commission and the transcript of the comments made by  Mrs Coleman  on the television program 'Monday Conference' a few weeks ago.

* Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** agrees with me.

* What is going to happen to the departments of Social **Security**, Health and Repatriation - to name 3 of them - which have social workers working for them?

* The Department of Social **Security** has hundreds of social workers working for it.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) In both Central and State offices of the Department of Social **Security**, the number of officers engaged in the administration of the Australian Assistance Plan is as follows: 
The number of positions in the administrative structure of the Australian Assistance Plan, apart from positions in the Department of Social **Security**, is as follows: 
-My grievance today concerns the financial plight of many primary producers, with the present gap in the income **security** system for all self-employed people in Australia.

* In theory there is no income **security** net whatever for self-employed small business people.

* Because of the very limited number of approvals for both unemployment benefit and household support the gap in the income **security** system is there just as much for farmers as it is for all small business people.

* That situation came about, to a certain extent, through the cooperation of senior officials of the Department of Social **Security** who arranged suitable criteria in relation to the work test and time periods in assessing eligibility.

* In relation to the unemployment benefit, we have to instil a more sympathetic attitude in many officers of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I believe that apart from conducting that review we should ask the new social welfare policy secretariat, under  Dr Sax,  as its first and most urgent job as part of an overall review of income **security**, to look at this great gap which exists in our income **security** net for all self-employed people and, particularly in this case, for farmers.

* Is it a fact that a project has been approved by the Minister for Social **Security** under the Australian Assistance Plan whereby more than $20,000 has been granted to the Western Metropolitan Adelaide Region for Social Development to expand volunteer, home English-teaching for migrants.

* If so, did the Minister for Social **Security** seek the Minister's advice prior to approving this project; if so, when, and what was the Minister's response; if not, why not.

* Since becoming Minister for Social **Security** I have also been disturbed by the restrictive regulations that some organisations impose on the freedom of their residents.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The existence of staff ceilings requires the Department to concentrate on essential work and priority is given to income **security** functions.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 September 1977: 
How many libraries are in the Department of Social **Security**, where is each located and what is the main purpose of each.

* When were the provision, number and purpose of libraries in the Department of Social **Security** last reviewed by the Department and /or the Public Service Board, and what recommendations were made at that time.

* What **security** of employment will there be for them?

* May I make this further point: There will .be no inducement for anyone to stay with this new Corporation either from the point of view of **security** or from the point of view of possessing a challenging job.

* In fact it can be truly said that the radiant light of the actions of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  who, as long ago as 1966 when he was in charge of social **security** legislation initiated measures designed to alleviate some of these problems has helped to a remarkable degree to banish sadness and darkness from the lives of many people.

* Some of these organisations have been in existence for many years, and have considerable assets and are recognised as good financial **security** risks.

* It would have been appreciated, too, if the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  had shown some initiative in the matter of meeting or subsidising the interest on the loans.

* This, we submit, is a a flat spot in our social **security** legislation and must be corrected.

* I do hope that the Minister for Social **Security** can inform the House that he at least is aware of this fact and, if so, that he intends to make positive moves to alleviate this area of great concern.

* Much remains to be done in the area of social **security**.

* I commend the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  for his sensible package of amendments to the 3 Bills.

* While congratulating the Minister for Social **Security**, I also congratulate the former Minister for Social Services, the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  and the LiberalCountry Party government of which he was a part, because most of the provisions we are considering tonight are updating now-ons from the 1972 package introduced by the honourable member for Mackellar.

* To say that he supports ANZUS but rejects its military emphasis is to ignore that it is essentially a **security** pact concerned to co-ordinate the efforts of the 3 parties for collective defence.

* At page 2648 of  Hansard he  said: 
The maintenance of our alliance with the United States under ANZUS remains most important for our **security** .

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Records are not maintained to show the breakdown by electoral divisions of expenditure under major programs of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Social **Security** Benefits in Municipalities of Broadmeadows, Coburg and Brunswick (Question No.

* 711) 
Accordingly, we in the Department of Social **Security** are carrying out quite an extensive survey to find out what the pattern of distribution is between sexes, age groups, occupation groups and geographic parts of the community of these people who are on unemployment benefits.

* Can he now inform the House what steps the Government has taken to assert this policy in the United Nations **Security** Council, particularly during the time our Ambassador there was acting as  President  of the **Security** Council?

* Does this show that it is not prepared to offer a measure of **security** to producers in the period until the benefits of controlled production can be achieved, and that it is prepared to jeopardise the livelihood of hundreds of producers?

* In correspondence with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the only information I am able to obtain is that in order to receive coverage for the child under any form of benefit other than family allowances the woman would have to resign her war widow's pension.

* She could then apply for a social **security** pension, which would result in a similar sum of money being available to her, but with reduced rights.

* However, I do dispute that the war widow's pension should then be used to deny the woman social **security** cover for the same child.

* Surely it is a simple matter of natural justice that the child and the mother should be entitled to the same rights as a civilian widow with a child on a social **security** pension, without having to accept the penalty that she must surrender her entitlements as a war widow.

* It may be an anomaly under the Act, but at this stage I have no indication that either the Minister for Veterans' Affairs or the Minister for Social **Security** is prepared to do anything about it.

* If the Repatriation Act is not to be permitted to cover such a child, I ask the Minister to ensure that arrangements are made so that the child is entitled to be considered for a social **security** pension in the normal way.

* after all that work and effort, she said that in Fitzroy just a toehold had been gained but little lasting value would result because of the lack of **security** and adequate equipment and the need for a team approach to the problem.

* People who are fearful of investing in short term securities because they fear a lack of **security** are driven to deposit in banks, thus earning interest on which they would be paying that extra 10 per cent surcharge.

* The Task Group comprises representatives from the Departments of Employment and Youth Affairs, Education, Finance, Health, Industry and Commerce, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Social **Security** (Social Welfare Policy Secretariat).

* Concessional interest rates have to be tied in with the type of **security** offered and the interest payments that were being made previously.

* As rural producers take advantage of it we can adjust the guidelines to encourage people to seek funds to gain **security**.

* I am afraid that the amount of $60m may be too small for the current year, but the Primary Industry Bank will give a better feeling of **security** to the people of rural Australia who will know that their debts will not have to be paid as fast as they would have to be paid through the normal trading banks.

* The system will still require a guaranteed form of **security** as good as that presently obtaining.

* What stifles borrowing in this country today, by both small business and rural industry, is the fact that the **security** requirements of the Australian banking institutions are so high.

* This Bill is important not only for what it provides directly but also for the further indication which it gives of the general social **security** principles on which this Government is operating.

* In his second reading speech, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  listed no fewer than 16 major provisions which are included in the Bill.

* Thirdly, and this time not through any electoral obligation but simply because of the Government's view that this is a proper course of action, the equality of various social **security** benefits is maintained.

* I have no doubt that both the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for Social **Security** will have an open mind on the subject - though I hope that it will not be so open as to embrace the solution offered by the honourable member for Mackellar, namely that all pensions should be fully taxable but that we should retain the age allowance.

* The best possible answer I can give to all that has been said by the Opposition this morning is not only to refer to the many telegrams of thanks from patients in nursing homes in my electorate which I have received since the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  promptly increased the subsidy by up to $20 a week for patients in nursing homes, but also to refer to a telegram received by the Minister from a person who I think the Opposition will recognise and, I believe, respect.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said that this year the Government will spend $14 lm supporting patients in nursing homes.

* I am reminded that it is not only the Minister for Social **Security** who is engaged in this enterprise.

* These centres cater for people other than aged people but their establishment helps aged people to stay in their own homes, because they have the assurance and the **security** to which the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  referred.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions: 
The **security** provided by the rule of law .

* is that **security** to which a man may confidently and calmly appeal even though every man's hand may be against him; the law's greatest benefits are for the minority man- the individual .

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
As indicated in my reply to Question No.

* 4528  (Hansard,  1 1 September 1979, page 982), the discussions in Malta, at officer level, were of a preliminary nature only and concerned general principles in relation to a basis on which Australia might commence negotiations for entering into a reciprocal agreement on social **security**.

* The general question of Australia's participation in reciprocal agreements on social **security** with a number of countries is under examination.

* The package which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has put forward is certainly acceptable as far as it goes.

* I would hope that the Minister, if he is still the Minister for Social **Security** in the future, will give consideration to this in the next revision of social **security** benefits.

* I know of one case recently in which for 3 months, no matter what was done in this city of about 10,000 people, the social **security** inspector would not accept that this woman had ended such a relationship.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 February: 
When was the attention of the Department of Social **Security** drawn to the findings in the (a) 1959 Annual Report of the Western Australian Department of Native Welfare, (b) 1976 report by the Western Australian Department for Community Welfare and (c) 1977 report by the Office for 
We ask the Prime Minister, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Government to drop clause 45 and give these people their due.

* As to nuclear fuels, these have a number of aspects, such as the scale and complexity of their use, **security** aspects and the international implications of dealing with fissionable materials which will be of national concern.

* It gives no **security** to the Aborigines.

* The latest moves by the Government of Papua New Guinea with which the Australian Government seems to concur, places the **security** of the people of the Torres Strait, particularly of" the islands of Dauan, Boigu and Saibai, in peril.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: 
Is this survey part of a general Government policy to reduce assistance to low income families and recipients of social **security**.

* Of course they may be receiving social **security** payments or they may be too old, too young or the wrong sex for any job that is available.

* Further, why has he been permitted to enter Australia and to engage in activities similar to those found to be a **security** risk in England?

* Will the Government make an investigation and, if these activities are found to be detrimental to national **security**, will the Government deport any KGB agents considered a **security** risk?

* Also, to help solve particular problems, companies which manufacture safes and **security** equipment are consulted.

* While these units have a high degree of **security** against theft and vandalism they are subject to a continuing process of design review and modification in detail to combat new modes of attack by thieves and vandals.

* An extensive field test of a preliminary model of a new type of 'local call only' public telephone, designed and made by the Department, which also has a high degree of **security** is currently being conducted in the Melbourne area.

* The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  says that the matter is to be considered to some extent by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* As is the practice in many countries, a passport is something to which a person should be entitled as of right, providing reasonable provisions are taken to protect the national **security**.

* Except for **security** reasons a person ought to be entitled to know why a passport has been refused.

* Passports can be refused because of criminal records, for **security** reasons, health reasons, matrimonial reasons or any other reasons which we do not know of or for no reasons whatever.

* Apart from the matter of **security**, not one of those headings to which I have referred would be the province of  Mr Justice 
The article goes on to talk about the plight of those persons who are living in nursing homes.

* I have endeavoured for some days to get the call during question time because this is a subject which I believe the Government and the Minister for Social **Security** are not facing in as responsible a manner as they should.

* There have been a number of letters to the editor in the Brisbane 'Courier Mail'- letters from matrons, from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  a fellow Queenslander, and then a reply from the matrons, as well as a number of articles.

* Even in the last election campaign the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in the Fitzroy Town Hall on 1 May 1974 said this: 
The Minister for Social **Security** said that: 'We promise urgent action on this matter.'

* I ask the Minister at the table if I could incorporate those 3 letters to the editor and the extract from the speech in Melbourne of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* As matrons of some of the most up to date nursing homes in Australia, we are dismayed and disgusted by the attitude of the Social **Security** Minister  (Mr Hayden),  towards patients in Queensland nursing homes.

* Bill Hayden, MP, Minister for Social **Security**.

* In reply to the Social **Security** Minister,  Mr Hayden  (C-M, 26 September) we, the Matrons, wish to declare that we are in fact not the spokesmen for the private enterprise nursing homes, but are speaking on behalf of our patients.

* The main purpose of this Bill now before the House is to make amendments of a formal nature to the Customs Act 190 1, so as to alter references in that Act to the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960 and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act 1956.

* These Acts will be repealed and replaced by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 and the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act 1979 respectively.

* The amendments proposed by this Bill, which also amends paragraph 2 19g (2) (b) of the Customs Act 1901 to take into account the revised terminology incorporated in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act 1979 in respect of activities prejudicial to **security**, will come into operation on the date of commencement of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Act 1979.

* I wish to direct a few remarks to the estimates for the Department of Social **Security**.

* That Department has direct outlays in the field of social **security** and welfare for this year estimated at some $4,772m.

* Direct outlays on social **security** and welfare in 1975-76 are equivalent to 21.8 per cent of the estimated total Budget outlay.

* That, of course makes our Department of Social **Security** one of the most important areas of government responsibility.

* There are one or two areas within the Department of Social **Security** to which I would like to direct specific attention.

* I believe that the Department of Social **Security** should look very seriously at making some commitment and some guarantee to these organisations so that they can borrow from outside the Department, carry on their programs and be guaranteed the funds when they become available.

* The same situation also exists in relation to the development and expansion of offices of the Department of Social **Security** throughout the nation.

* After many years of making representations in relation to Swan Hill, which is in my electorate, we were last year granted approval for the development of an office of the Department of Social **Security**.

* It was a much needed office because Department of Social **Security** services do not exist in that area within a distance of 240 miles.

* As a result the administration of social **security** benefits and payments did create anomalies and disadvantages for the people who live in that immediate radius.

* Once again I can only say to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Stewart),  who is at the table, that great consideration should be given to expanding these necessary resources and facilities within the rural areas.

* The same thing can also be said for the decentralising of these social **security** offices into other areas for the benefit of the people they would serve.

* On 22 April I wrote to the then Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden.

* Despite the fact that they were registered as unemployed, despite representations to Ministers, despite the fact that they had no income whatsoever for a period of some 18 months and even at the end of that time they had to borrow money to restock their properties, they were not entitled to any benefit through the social **security** system because of the criteria that existed.

* I believe that the criteria that exist within the social **security** system are an injustice and an inequity and I do hope that the Minister will look at this with a view to making some adjustment.

* The policy of monetary restraint which we are pursuing has led to adjustments to government **security** yields and to the raising of the statutory reserve deposit ratio.

* Has the Minister used all means available to convince the South Australian Labor Premier and his Government and the Labor Opposition in this House that this waste of time represents a disregard for **security**, production and national development?

* One is the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation being used as a direct arm of the Government of the day and being used simply in a direct political way as an instrumentality of the government, perhaps for the promotion of its electoral success and other things.

* Unfortunately the very personal qualities that make  Mr Justice  Woodward an admirable Director-General of **Security** I believe are wrongly put about in this debate by honourable members saying: 'There is nothing to worry about in the legislation; do not worry about it because we have such an excellent DirectorGeneral, somebody appointed by the Labor Government and kept on by the present Government.

* A democratic **security** service in Australia is a contradiction in terms.

* I believe that the history of **security** organisations, both here and overseas, is not a very encouraging one.

* There is much more evidence to suggest that **security** organisations in fact have contributed to the undermining of the democratic system in a variety of countries than they have actually assisted in preserving it.

* The first is recognition of the need for some measure of financial **security** for those who devote a significant portion of their working lives to parliamentary service.

* For the information of honourable members, the new direct billing arrangements could include persons in the following categories: persons on low income including social **security** unemployment, sickness or special beneficiaries; newly arrived migrants and some other ethnic groups; refugees who are financially disadvantaged; persons who suffer financial misfortune because of substantial medical expenses caused by prolonged or severe illness.

* This amendment ensures that the provisions of the Health Insurance Act remain in line with corresponding social **security** and repatriation legislation to maintain uniformity in the provision of 'fringe benefits' to pensioners.

* In his second reading speech the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  set out why the Government had seen fit to bring in these Bills and why it considered the legislation to be necessary.

* On page 4147 of Hansard, the Minister for Social **Security** gives the cost of the present scheme in providing direct subsidies to hospital and medical benefit funds, the cost of the pensioner medical and hospital services and the services provided for repatriation beneficiaries.

* He referred to the substantial indirect subsidy provided by way of taxation concessions and went on to say: 
The Minister for Social **Security** referred to these reserves as being unnecessarily large and he stated that approximately 15 per cent of the contributions to medical funds is lost in administrative expenses.

* My authority for saying this is a publication issued by the Australian Department of Social **Security** entitled 'Operations of the Registered Medical and Hospital Benefits Organisations'.

* When the Minister for Social **Security** claims that hospital fund reserves of SI 24m are unnecesarrily large, obviously he is speaking as a politician and not as an economist or a businessman with actuarial common sense.

* I do not think there is much doubt but that a Labor government would jack up taxes and reduce defence spending, thereby endangering the **security** of this country.

* The Fraser Government's failure to respond to the crisis in the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry, with appropriate policies to improve consumer demand and provide a viable future with resulting employment **security**.

* -Has the Minister for Social **Security** noted the recent report in the 'Bulletin' of 21 September concerning a Morgan gallup poll survey of the preference of people for the present health insurance scheme or 'a salaried medical service financed by a 1.35 per cent levy on taxable income'?

* Is the article in the 'Bulletin' illustrated by a photograph of the Minister for Social **Security** with the caption 'polls show no liking for his schemes'?

* It seems reasonable and sensible therefore that these funds should be invested to the best advantage consistent with **security**.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 27 September 1978: 
How many computers are (a) owned, (b) operated, (c) in the process of being purchased or (d) rented by the Department of Social **Security** and statutory authorities and business undertakings under the control of the Minister.

* Land prices will go on soaring and social welfare and **security** programs like Medibank are under threat.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
We agree with that.

* We tried to ensure that services for migrants would be available within the service departments and that there would be sections within the departments of Social **Security**, Health and Education to deal with the needs of migrants.

* The Minister went on to say that it is difficult also to get quick results in other areas; for example, social **security**, where it is necessary to settle principles on which discussions and negotiations for agreement can be reached with other countries.

* These people have invested in order to provide some **security** for their families.

* I must say that I feel that it is more than just a matter of philosophy, because I am certain that honourable members opposite would accept the point of view that I now put, namely, that it must be the basic and inalienable right of every Australian and his family not only to own a piece of his native land but also to have the **security** of knowing that the dwelling in which he lives is his for life and can be passed on after his life to those members of his family who may be in a position to occupy it.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  presented a program for aged persons homes.

* Under that program, thousands of aged people who considered themselves in some sort of **security** because they could get into aged persons homes that were planned for construction over the next 3 years now find that the proposed homes to which they were to go are missing from the list and that there are no plans to subsidise the respective homes over the next 3 years.

* The normal practice is to arrange their movement aboard Qantas flights on which **security** officers of that Airline are travelling.

* The Labor Party believes, quite as fervently, as does everybody else, that it is the basic responsibility of any government to ensure the **security** of Australia.

* This is very much within the consciousness of members of the Labor Party, and no policy of the Labor Party given effect to after the next election or at any time in the future would imperil the **security** of Australia.

* This is something which is of vital interest to the **security** of Australia 
Is the honourable member for Fraser now to say that the Australian Government is acting unwisely when it looks at the **security** of the Australian people?

* Britain is no longer in the position to intervene with conventional forces to defend the **security** of Australia.

* I believe that whatever be the responsibilities of an Australian Government, its first responsibility is the **security** of the Australian people.

* This Government has been betrayed that **security** by permitting the defence forces to be eroded and by the insults it has given to our allies 6n the very point of intervention to protect an innocent country from communist aggression because it was communist aggression.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The next question was: 'If "No", do you believe the death penalty should be retained for (a) crimes against national **security**, for example, treason; (b) murder by destruction of aircraft; (c) murder of policemen or warders; (d) murder associated with kidnapping?'

* However, in respect of crimes against national **security** the State percentages in favour of retention averaged only 75 per cent as against 91 per cent average for all other responses.

* I believe that were this Bill to be passed there would be an erosion of that **security** and of the capacity of law enforcement agencies to undertake their task.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The other important part of the honourable gentleman's question concerned **security** of tenure.

* I am anxious that the leases be issued at the earliest possible date so as to ensure that the two communities have the **security** over their land which they desire.

* Under a compulsory health insurance scheme the moneys would come, as we have suggested, from a social **security** levy on taxable income or, as others have suggested from time to time, from the public purse.

* The Internal **Security** Act permits the Singapore government to imprison any political dissident without charge or trial for indefinite periods.

* It was reported in the Straits Times on 20th February 1978 that, to a query by a reporter from the Far Eastern Economic Review on whether **security** authorities in Singapore use technics like questioning naked or lightly clothed suspects in very cold airconditioned room forlong periods, keeping them in solitary confinement, denying them adequate sleep, and dousing them with cold water, Lee Kuan Yew's reply was: 'all interrogations must wear down the resistance of these persons by sustained psychological pressure, including physical fatigue'.

* Almost all detainees have been locked up for 24 hours a day in solitary confinement in special mental torture cells in Changi Maximum **Security** Prison, which is normally used for convicted criminals.

* The point is made that the Internal **Security** Act permits the Singaporean Government to imprison any political dissident without charge or trial for an indefinite period.

* I would imagine that we can say that with that appointment and other appointments which have been made- they were made after consultation with  Mr Justice  Hopethe **security** and intelligence services of our own country and the relations between those and the **security** and intelligence services of other countries will be conducted with enhanced benefit to our country.

* I spoke to each of these people in turn and asked, if they had such a wonderful setup of social **security** in Denmark, why they wanted to migrate to Australia.

* Young men who went to work were unable to make ends meet because they had to finance this social **security** system which, even then, they had doubts about.

* He is a man of compassion with a driving zeal to achieve happiness and **security** for those in the community for whom we have a special responsibility.

* Expenditure on Commonwealth financed social **security**, health and housing is in excess of $l,900m a year.

* Firstly, they not only again re-emphasise the attitude of the Opposition on this legislation but also endorse the principle that we previously followed in respect of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill,  namely that we believe that the AttorneyGeneral has to be placed in a position in which he is seen ultimately as having some real authority over the Director-General of **Security**.

* Their **security** requires more, not less, support.

* It is folly to believe that the reduced level of Vietcong activity in Phuoc Tuy Province means long term **security** for Australia's forces there.

* People in a democracy are reluctant to think that their elected government is party to lies and deception, particularly in matters involving the Armed Forces and the nation's **security**.

* We all know that prisons are places of **security**.

* France has pursued a course of international peace and **security**, as has Australia.

* This was clearly due to the fact that people realised that their job **security** as well as their real wages were threatened by high inflation rates.

* I have already raised this matter in the Parliament and made representations to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in my attempts to have this anomaly rectified.

* Apparently it is rigid and dogmatic to oppose conscription except where Australian **security** is threatened; I would have thought this was neither rigid nor dogmatic because it allowed graduated response based on the degree and nature of the threat.

* United Nations; our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations; our treaties with friendly powers; and our association in a variety of international and regional arrangements for **security**, trade and economic aid.

* The credibility of a government in its international dealings depends heavily on the sanctity of its undertakings and the **security** of the confidences given to it by others.

* I have said it was inevitable and right that China should should hold the permanent seat in the **Security** Council.

* It implies that international agreements such as ANZUS, which is the corner-stone of our **security**, are expendable scraps of paper.

* Millions of Australians now rely on the life insurance industry for their long-term **security** and the welfare of their families.

* The compelling answer is that insurance fulfils a necessary or essential social need; it provides financial protection against unpredictable losses and a means for individuals and families to provide for their own long term economic **security**.

* The positive side is that I believe these funds and other funds that are available through the TAB and through the Government, whether through the Department of the Capital Territory, the Department of Health or the Department of Social **Security**, for community use and development in the Territory ought to be rationalised.

* Mr Samuel's article draws unwarranted conclusions, is mischievous and is unreasonably unfair to people in the Department of Social **Security**, to the system of unemployment benefits and, I suggest, is a cheap way of developing an article.

* In the afternoon I was privileged to open the offices of the Department of Social **Security** in Campbelltown which is a regionalised and decentralised centre.

* There was little dissent between all the people there on the way to go about solving the problems of the area and the way to go about solving social **security** problems and the various needs in a society where there is very little slack and where people when they lose their income are in immediate need.

* The role of reports in this Parliament, the role of reports in the way that the policies of the Department of Social **Security** have been formulated over the past 20 months, has been one very good symptom of open government.

* I have referred to 2 events- the opening of a health centre and the opening of a Social **Security** office on which there has been agreement largely between the levels of government.

* Instead, I want to say something about an amendment which I propose to move in the committee stage which is not related to the matters which the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  mentioned but does come within the order of leave for the Bills.

* Very often it is a terrible thing for such a man that when he is faced with the loss of his wife, at the same time, because of the fact that he receives no social **security** benefits or help, he is faced with the loss of his young children because he is unable to keep them at home.

* We should not be adding to this emotional situation the financial hardship of receiving no help from social **security** benefits.

* They are designed to cure 2 of the remaining defects in our social **security** system.

* We come back to the basic trickery in social **security** under this Government.

* It must be unpleasant, I am sure, for all except the  voyeurs  in the Department of Social **Security**- hopefully, there would not be many of them- to enforce the rule and to check on the actual relationship of people.

* I hope that some explanation will be given either by the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  who represents the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in this House or by the Minister for Social **Security** when the legislation comes before the Senate.

* 1 do not want to go into the involved complicated and detailed resolutions of the **Security** Council relating to Rhodesia, but I do want to draw the attention of the House to the resolution that was passed by the **Security** Council in 1970; that is, Resolution 277.

* Paragraph 2 reads: 
It also means that the Great Powers will likewise voluntarily limit their involvement in collective **security** arrangements and will not seek or use any facilities for militarising the Indian Ocean.

* It has developed beyond what it started out as - a regional economic and cultural union - into a body that is becoming increasingly concerned with foreign affairs and **security** issues.

* Over the last 10 years in Australia expenditure on social **security** and welfare has increased almost sevenfold from $1.3 billion in 1969-70 to $5 billion in 1975-76, which was the last year of the Labor Government, to an estimated $8.9 billion in 1979-80.

* Even if adjustments are made for expenditure on family allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, the increased eligibility nevertheless means that expenditure on social **security** and welfare as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76, Labor's last Budget, to 21 per cent in the current Budget.

* Over the past 10 years the number of people in receipt of social **security** pensions and benefits has more than doubled from about one million in 1969 to over two million this year.

* to (3) As the honourable member would know, this Government adheres to the policy established by the then Prime Minister  Mr Chifley  in 1949, followed by successive Governments since that time, and endorsed by  Mr Justice  Hope at paragraph 781 of the Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**, namely that neither details of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization nor its operations are disclosed.

* I would, however, draw the honourable member's attention to the comments of  Mr Justice  Hope on this general topic contained in paragraphs 195 to 199, and 464 to 467 of the first volume of the Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* Has the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** seen reports that the Department of Social **Security** is enforcing more stringently the requirement that supporting mothers seek maintenance from the fathers of their offspring before receiving a supporting mother's benefit?

* The proposed pension increase of $5 is one more Government achievement in the field of social **security**.

* Our record in social **security** is all the more impressive when one looks at the record of the Opposition when it was in government.

* Leader of &lt;the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  discussing the sufferings of pensioners who had just received a $5 increase from this Government - the largest single cash increase and the largest percentage increase in the history of social **security**.

* I draw the attention of the honourable member for Hotham, who is no longer in the chamber, to a statement by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that this Government stands firm by its commitment to increase pensions twice a year until they reach 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings.

* I ask the Minister for Defence: Is he aware that some persons, who I am led to believe are members of the media, have undertaken independent tests to check the **security** of Navy ships?

* We have introduced major improvements to the nursing home benefits scheme to give financial **security** to all patients and we are sharing the financial load with the private health insurance funds.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
-In relation to the remarks just made by the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby),  I seek his indulgence to consider a report which appeared in the  Canberra Times  on 8 October this year.

* It contained extensive quotations which were purported to be from the actual directive given by no less than 3 Prime Ministers to the heads of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation stating precisely their areas of responsibility.

* The Prime Minister has never before had the responsibility before Parliament for the **security** organisation.

* What both Prime Ministers instructed their **security** chiefs was that in matters affecting total government policy they had direct access to the Prime Minister.

* On other matters they were to liaise with the Ministers of the various departments but only in areas affecting the operation of their departments as they pertained to **security** matters likely to be detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth.

* Yet Russia has been just as guilty, probably more so, of offending against the peace and **security** of other nations than even Peking.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Our attitude to the movement of Australian citizens and, for that matter, Chinese citizens to and from Australia has, I think, already been made clear by me in a statement made to the National Press Club one day last week.

* We do not place any embargo on the movement of Australian citizens to the People's Republic of China unless there are **security** considerations involved.

* We do not place any obstacles in the way of the movement of people from the People's Republic of China to Australia unless similar kinds of **security** considerations are involved.

* -I had before me legislation that was in draft form and which I hoped to put to the Parliament and to inform the **Security** Council of.

* I have consistently said on this matter that Australia will meet its international obligations as determined by the **Security** Council, but in meeting those obligations I will not trample over the rights of individual Australians to participate in political matters and express a particular view about Rhodesia.

* I will meet those obligations and I will repeat in the **Security** Council that Australia will meet its obligations.

* It is a beautiful thing to be able to go home on a Friday night at the end of the parliamentary week to find a haven of peace and **security** which a wife has managed to maintain in our absence, while fathering children in a surrogate fashion and maintaining commitments within the electorate.

* I want to reply quickly to the points that have been made in the course of the debate on the estimates for the Department of Social **Security**, which has gone well over 3 hours, well beyond the time set down for this discussion.

* He attracts no benefit from the Department of Social **Security**.

* If I can give the honourable member for Hotham one warning, currently I am investigating the practices of the Department of Social **Security** developed under previous governments of the releasing to a whole range of authorities of what I regard as very personal information by people who use the files of that Department.

* Not only law enforcement agencies but also, in some cases, even debt collecting agencies have been able to obtain information from the Department of Social **Security**.

* In debating the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill we are dealing- grappling might be the more appropriate word- with a legal definition of the word 'subversion'.

* In an attempt to define the meaning of subversion, clause 5 reads: 
activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Com monwealth for the purposes of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth; 
Nobody would have any objection to the principle that there should be no hindrance to the performance of the Defence Force in looking after the **security** of the nation.

* In our view it is appropriate to define the activities as being unlawful activities which will hinder the Defence Force and prevent it from looking after the **security** or the defence of the nation.

* It seems that, in determining whether an activity is interfering with the performance of the Defence Force or of its function, the activity must be identified on an intelligent basis as being an activity that is related to the overthrow of the nation or interfering with the **security** of the nation.

* In other words, we have to impart what democracies are all about and what opposition parties mean when they talk about a bipartisan attitude to **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I am sorry,  Mr Speaker.

* The essence of the censure motion against the Government is that it has jeopardised Aus tralian **security**, firstly, through vacillation In relation to the commitment of troops to the Five Power Arrangements thereby putting at risk the whole Five Power Arrangements and, secondly, by undesirable disclosures of **security** information.

* If this was so unexceptionable and so well known, why did the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence - I am not sure who it was but I am reliably informed that this happened - reissue the D notice imposing a voluntary **security** restraint on the Australian Press and other media in relation to this matter?

* Yet when this matter becomes the responsibility of members of the Labor Government and their hangers-on in their offices - and many of those hangers-on refuse to have **security** checks - it is disclosed straightaway.

* The Prune Minister succumbed to them and he thereby jeopardised the **security** of this country.

* In the light of subsequent events I want to emphasise that this was a decision taken on defence grounds and in the best interests of the **security** of the nation.

* At this point, defence considerations and the **security** of the country, which had been rapidly diminishing in importance anyway in the minds of members of the Government in their approach to this question, completely disappeared.

* Briefly, the conditions are: ( 1 ) That the moneys are borrowed on terms and conditions that the Treasurer is satisfied are reasonable; (2) that proper **security** is given to the Commonwealth over the aircraft; (3) that the aircraft, spares and equipment subject of the **security** will be kept insured to the full insurable value against customary risks; (4) that the aircraft, spares and equipment will not be sold nor made the subject of a mortgage having priority over the Commonwealth's **security** in respect of the guarantee; and (5) that any special condition may be implemented that the Treasurer may see fit to impose.

* These are that the passengers are protected against the activities of unlawful operators; that higher safety standards are ensured; that there is a reliability of services; and that intending travellers have a **security** for any money they may pay to airlines that are operating under that agreement.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** whether it is a fact that under the Government's proposed health scheme the $16 per day bed allowance for patients in private hospitals will cease after approximately 180 days and long term patients will then be forced back to standard wards in public hospitals, as the special account arrangements which at present provide indefinite cover for such patients are to be abolished.

* Furthermore, my Department's Queensland Regional Director has made arrangements with the Department of Social **Security** for regular visits to be made to Aurukun and Mornington Island to ensure that those people entitled to social **security** benefits, including unemployment benefits, are able to apply for and receive their entitlements.

* A sound defence system is essential to national **security**.

* If this is Labor Party thinking on national **security**, it deserves the rubbishing it will get from the Australian people.

* For our own **security**, we must have the capacity to mobilise at extremely short notice, and this we cannot accomplish if our military structure is not there to build upon and if we have not enough trained personnel readily available to attempt to rebuild a substantial structure.

* The system under which we operate at the present moment has, in spite of the emotional red herrings that have been dragged across the trail to fool the people, proved successful, and I would say to those members of the Opposition who would destroy this system, if they were unfortunately to become the Government, that a tremendous responsibility would rest on their shoulders, for the price of their neglect of adequate defence for Australia would be our national **security** - and this is not hard to understand.

* How long after the completion of a high **security** offshore quarantine station would he anticipate that imports of (a) cattle, (b) sheep, (c) goats and (d) pigs would be permitted from (i) Southern Africa, (ii) the Asian mainland, (iii) the Persian Gulf area, (iv) the United States of America, (v) Mexico and South America and ( vi) Eastern Europe.

* In my talks with the Secretary for Defence and Deputy Secretary Packard, who has recently visited this country, I raised the question of the **security** of the Indian Ocean.

* The signature of the new arrangements on 1st November reflects the readiness of the Heath Government to make a contribution to the **security** and stability of our region which is both welcome ant!

* There was also a close identity of views on the **security** of the Indian Ocean.

* I want to make the point to this Committee that it is natural for Government supporters to take that view because every speech made by members of the Opposition on foreign affairs has stressed that there are no threats to our **security** and that there is no potential danger to us.

* From the point of view of jobs and **security** people do not know where their future lies.

* Many of those with jobs are very worried about their job **security**.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: 
Precisely.

* In his statement of 18th August the Prime Minister sought to assure the people that the purpose of sending our troops to Vietnam had been substantially achieved, that **security** throughout the country had improved remarkably.

* When the 3rd Battalion was withdrawn from Phouc Tuy the **security** of our forces - as is commonly recognised - was jeopardised but if, with the withdrawal of another battalion, only one battalion is left at Nui Dat it will be criminal negligence on the part of the Government.

* We should seek the assurance of the South Vietnamese Government that the South Vietnamese Regular Army will be responsible for the **security** of the approaches to Vung Tau.

* In the field of social **security** we have done a great deal to keep contact with the people who need assistance and advice.

* In th, Department of Social **Security** at the moment work is being let out.

* That is the sort of delay which exists in the Department of Social **Security** with complicated claims.

* In at least one State, possible three, decisions have been taken by the staff of the Department of Social **Security** that they will not deal with representations by members of Parliament because that adds to their work load, makes their normal work load impossible and merely delays the processing of claims.

* The future **security** of Australia's thalidomide children is not an issue that should vary with the political complexion of the Government.

* The proposal is for the construction of a comprehensive animal quarantine station comprising the following main groupings of buildings: quarantine **security** area, administrative and public area, service buildings and three staff residences.

* The Committee in recommending the construction of the proposal made the following recommendations: 
The Governor-General continued:   the dear failure of existing social and economic structures to meet the needs of modern society, particularly in relation to education, social **security**, health, industrial relations and urban and regional development.

* Whilst our **security** people are in close, almost daily, contact with the **security** service of the United Kingdom we have not yet received a full report of the reasons why the 105 citizens of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have been expelled from or prevented from coming back to the United Kingdom.

* This must be a constant preoccupation of the Government and a constant preoccupation of the Australian **security** service.

* It is wrong to spend more money on the machinery of war if peace and **security** in the region is what we seek to achieve.

* 1 ) While information on reserve stocks of ammunition must remain classified, I can state there is no danger to the nation 's **security** from a lack  of  ammunition.

* I reiterate the pride that the Australian Government takes - and I would think all members of the Australian Parliament should take - in the fact that last month a most experienced and distinguished Australian was  President  of the **Security** Council during that crucial period and did all that that body could do to bring an end to the hostilities.

* The Government feared that such a conviction could lead to the Americans and others using Woomera, becoming aware about the total inadequacy of Australia's **security** precautions.

* During their investigations Commonwealth Police inquiries revealed a major loop hole in **security** at Woomera.

* During their inquiries in the Kotz case the Commonwealth Police repeatedly found themselves beating their heads against a series of brick walls created by **security** at Woomera, the Weapons Research Establishment and the Department of Supply, all of whom were seeking only to cover up a major scandal for fear of upsetting the United States Government.

* I understand that this is not an isolated case of the Commonwealth Police being deliberately frustrated in their efforts to prosecute breaches of **security**.

* As a result of the Kotz case the Commonwealth Police Commissioner sent a top level inspector from Canberra to investigate and report on **security** at Woomera.

* It is clear that the Commonwealth Police are being deliberately denied the opportunity of performing their task with efficiency by a Government which is concerned only to cover up our inadequate **security** arrangements for fear of upsetting the Americans.

* The answer given by the Minister for Supply to my question regarding the prosecution of a man in connection with the disappearance of secret rocket firings film from Woomera clearly indicates that the Government in general and the Minister in particular are concerned only with covering up serious breaches in Australia's **security** arrangements.

* It is obvious that this Government is pursuing a double standard with regard to Australia's **security** in general and at Woomera in particular.

* Firstly, I ask it to table in the House of Representatives the report of a senior Commonwealth Police Inspector to his Commissioner regarding **security** at Woomera.

* Secondly, I challenge the Government to establish a select parliamentary committee into the arrangements which are made at the present time to guarantee Australia's **security**.

* Who are the real traitors so far as the **security** of Australia is conconcerned when the **security** forces of this country are sabotaged by high level departmental officers and ex-Ministers?

* Any curtailment of the internationally recognised privileges and immunities - particularly the latter - on Australia's part could thus create difficulties for our Australian posts overseas and perhaps jeopardise their **security**.

* I claim to have been misrepresented by the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  who accused me of asking a question that I had been requested to ask by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 May 1978: 

 Mr Deputy Speaker, this Budget is a positive one.

* It is a Budget which will help us achieve our great national aims of economic strength and prosperity, social welfare, and **security**.

* The Department of Social **Security** recently has withdrawn these benefits from several of the graziers in this area.

* The Department of Social **Security** is under the pressures reflected by our changing social patterns and behaviour, but there has been no change in the outlook of these settlers.

* I acknowledge that, with the errors recently found within the Department of Social **Security**, the recent appointment of  Mr Lanigan  as its new head probably will mean a more conservative approach still.

* If necessary, officers of the Department should be made available to assist with applications and to make on-the-spot inspections in order to effect immediate transfer from unemployment benefits to household support so as to ensure continuity of payment and **security** for these people.

* These deficiences need progressive reforms, which have been under intensive examination by the Liberal Party's committee on social **security**, health and welfare over the past several months, and I know also by the Country Party's health and social **security** committee.

* This has been done to avoid the many errors that the Minister for Social **Security**, in good faith, fell into by announcing principles before having his principles tested by expert practical criticism.

* Some of the major guidelines submitted to working parties by my committee on social **security**, health and welfare are as follows: We believe as a committee that health care reasonably available is a right.

* Why should they make an offer of beds to the Minister for Social **Security**, which offer in itself is an act of selfdestruction?

* At the other end - here I want to be fair to the Minister for Social **Security** and I do not want to misquote him - I suggest that the whole thrust of the Green Paper, sugared down a little in the White Paper and sugared down a little more in the Bill, is bulk billing.

* The first is that they must resort purely to a sessional basis working in a public hospital, or work for a salary, both of which results, I believe, would please the Minister for Social **Security** and his Party immensely.

* Would they have us reduce spending on social **security** or education?

* We have just been told that not enough is being spent on social **security** and that pensions are not adequate.

* He will remember that two days ago, first the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** and then the Prime Minister himself, said that the Minister would be having some discussions with the National Labour Consultative Council before the Minister for Social **Security** made her statement on proposals that special benefit or unemployment benefit payments should not be made to persons who have been refused work by employers because of electricity restrictions, and other proposals that unemployment benefit should not be paid to young men and women who leave school this year before schools resume next year.

* The AIDC would rank as a Commonwealth **security** for the investment of those funds.

* Because an investment bond is not a fixed interest **security** providing for repayment of a stated amount at a given time but a contractual interest in the value of a given collection of assets and in the income earned by them, it is possible to finance projects with little or no return in the early years but high growth and income at' a later stage.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 24 March 1977: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-We have just listened to what was probably one of the most frank expositions of the Labor Party's position in regard to this Bill.

* The honourable senator is reputed to have advised  Senator Murphy  in that historic raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and since that event I do not think he has made one constructive suggestion to either the Government or the Parliament.

* As announced by  Senator the  Honourable Margaret Guilfoyle, Minister for Social **Security**, the Government has decided to make provisions for a benefit to be paid to supporting fathers on the same basis as supporting mothers.

* He will act as Minister for Tourism and Recreation and will represent the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation and Minister for Social **Security** in this House.

* I would like to wind up the debate quickly and to compliment members of the Government who spoke in the course of it upon their perceptive  and  sensitive approach to the subject of the debate - social **security** benefits.

* Again, at least one other member of the Opposition expressed disappointment because supplementary assistance had not been adjusted in these adjustments to social **security** benefits.

* In the Budget in September, quite a range of other benefits - without specifying any or committing myself to any at this stage - which are the responsibility of my Department of Social **Security** will be adjusted upwards.

* Goodness gracious, we have done more to improve social **security** benefits than any previous government did.

* Now let me talk about the record of the former Minister for Social Services, the honourable member for Mackellar, who somehow or other tried to beat up an issue by saying that the Minister for Social **Security** - myself, in case the listeners do not know of whom he is speaking - is trying to deceive the people when he says that the standard rate of pension is near enough to 25 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings.

* We are far from happy about that, and it is an area which I personally, as well as the Department of Social **Security** and the Government, am exploring.

* It is highly desirable that we get this Bill to the Senate and that the whole matter be concluded as speedily as possible in the interests of those people who stand to gain so much from this most generous increase in social **security** benefits for which we have been responsible.

* I enclose 2 letters from the Department of Social **Security** placed in my letter box on 9th and 10th March.

* A number of issues are facing this country and in my view the most important is the **security** of the country from both internal and external threat.

* That we should have debated the estimates of the Department of Defence for so short a period is a serious indictment of the community's attitude, as reflected in this Parliament, towards the **security** of this country.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-We are debating a very important Bill, which is colloquially known as the 1975 Budget.

* At present we are dealing with the Department of Health, the Department of Repatriation and Compensation and the Department of Social **Security**.

* As the shadow Minister for Social **Security** I shall address my remarks to the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Committee is being asked tonight to pass $1 billion or $ 1,000m worth of expenditure to be spent by the Department of Social **Security**.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I would just like to relate a little of my experiences with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to indicate that the Opposition is not talking theoretically.

* If the Minister of the day happens to see that as a **security** threat he can invoke this clause because it is wide enough to drive a horse and cart through.

* Anything can be represented as interfering with the plans of the Government to defend the **security** of the State.

* Those great ringing words 'the **security** of the State' are the sort of slogan with which Hitler went to war and with which he legally took control of the German people who one would have thought were a sophisticated people- politically aware.

* I have no doubt that Hitler and Goebbels said exactly the same when people objected to the sweeping terms in which they wrote laws for the **security** of the German state.

* The Minister for Social **Security** made an even more serious misrepresentation when speaking of our policies on social welfare.

* The Minister for Social **Security** knows that if increases in pensions were geared to cost of living increases - the consumer price index - they would be less than if they were geared to average weekly earnings increases.

* The Minister for Social **Security** can hand out thousands of dollars under the Australian Assistance Plan.

* But, for some reason or other, the Minister for Social **Security** cannot bring himself to backdate to 1 June, as the Opposition wants, this increase in nursing home benefits to keep the aged and the sick inside homes.

* I direct to the Prime Minister a question which is supplementary to the question asked by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in relation to the raid on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Canberra.

* I suppose if we examine the time allotted to this debate and related it to the time available for other Bills we have had a fairly generous bite of the apple but the important thing is that we have to send out a message to this nation, loud and clear, that the responsibility for the **security** and defence of this country, and dealing adequately with it, falls on its citizens.

* I am sure honourable members on both sides of the House would agree that every member of this House has to get across to the Australian public the message that each and every one of them is involved in our **security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 31 May 1979: 
1 ) How does the Department of Social **Security** determine the value of British pensions, when making allowance for these pensions in the payment of Australian social **security** benefits.

* How often does the Department of Social **Security** make determinations on the value of British pensions.

* The whole tax and social **security** system must be comprehensively assessed to remove features counter-productive to the principal goals.

* Much more care needs to be taken in the study than appears to have been taken by the Coombs task force in its rather superficial examination of such questions as the degree to which social **security** payments by way of child endowment and existing concessional deductions such as those for dependants, education expenses and others, achieve their social objective.

* The absurdity of such a conclusion demonstrates clearly that the rate scale, concessions, rebate systems and all other features of the tax and social **security** system need to be assessed as a whole.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  like the dishonest milkman who waters down the milk, has given the pensioners an increased quantity of money but it is of rapidly declining value.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 12 October 1977: 
Australia's national and economic **security**.

* In fact  Hansard  will have recorded that when the Minister for Tourism and Recreation  (Mr Stewart),  representing the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Wheeldon),  introduced them into this House last week, on behalf of the Opposition I sought leave to move a motion that the debate be adjourned until a later hour that day so that the Bills could be given expedition in this House and passed to the Senate because we suspect that the Government will be trying to level the charge at the Opposition that we prevented pensioners from receiving their increases because of our delaying tactics.

* The following day in the Senate my friend and colleague,  Senator Baume,  asked a similar question of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* It is a fact that these people with children literally have not got the money to buy meals and clothing for their children; yet they cannot obtain benefits, whereas the person who works for them on their property as a labourer can, if things go bad, simply go to the social **security** office and qualify for some benefit.

* I think the second reading speech of the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and Minister assisting the Minister for Social **Security** claims that the standard pension has reached 25.2 per cent of average weekly male earnings, but the Minister did not say that that is based upon figures for the June 1975 quarter.

* I will not canvass that that is wrong because precisely that statement- that pensions should be tied to the consumer price index- is in the Opposition 's social **security** policy.

* As the  Deputy  Prime Minister said, it is a war aimed at the **security** of those who might be leaders in the country at the national or at the local village level.

* It tries to undermine the structure of the country to demonstrate that the national government cannot offer and cannot afford **security**.

* Is it necessary for the Communists to be our allies before we will gain the support of the Australian Labor Party in a great national purpose for Australia, in which Australia's national interests and future **security** are closely interwoven?

* Time will not allow me to cover all the matters I would like to cover in this debate but I want to refer briefly to the Department of Social **Security** because I think there are a few anomalies that need to be looked into.

* For the purpose of social **security** recipients I divide benefits into 4 categories.

* I think I can say that the Opposition Parties generally support the principle of an increase in the various social **security** rates.

* Honourable members will recall that on 5 May 1977 I advised the House of certain decisions that the Government had taken in relation to the organisation of intelligence and **security** arrangements.

* Those decisions followed the Government's study of one of the reports of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* The Office will be subject to policy control and managerial oversight through the Committee of Ministers on Intelligence and **Security** assisted by a committee of permanent heads, as I announced on 5 May.

* It is a step towards implementing some of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* I am advised that the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Social **Security** are examining the question of the longitudinal survey of Vietnamese refugees, originally proposed to be undertaken by  Dr Martin,  in the context of considering a much wider survey of refugees in Australia.

* Furthermore, the allocation for the Austraiian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has been increased by $898,000 or 7.1 per cent.

* So we are going to have more police boxes, more **security** provisions all around the place and more ASIO agents, although heavens knows what they will be for.

* The proposal, contained in a special 'task force' report, will be given to State Ministers of Social **Security** tomorrow.

* Social **security** payments for children living overseas are no longer paid.

* A slight outburst which was reported in the Melbourne 'Herald' on 6 February involved the Minister for Social **Security**, the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  who was said to be very annoyed and called upon the Federal Government to approach the problems more justly by giving to the Ipswich appeal instead of giving only to the Brisbane Lord Mayor's flood appeal.

* Will he ignore any representations to prevent  Mr Kolesnik's  admission as part of a bargain to obtain USSR support for Australia's election to the **Security** Council of the United Nations.

* Are any private **security** organisations employed to protect Commonwealth property in the A.C.T.

* What is the cost to the Commonwealth of any private **security** organisations employed on these duties.

* I refer to the **security** report used by the Government to justify its purchase of two Boeing 727 aircraft for the Prime Minister's personal use on overseas travel.

* Does the report clearly state that the **security** risks are minimal when using aircraft chartered either from Qantas Airways Ltd or by Qantas Airways Ltd?

* We have seen tonight from the attitude adopted by members of the Government and the levity which was expressed in relation to the comments made by my dear colleague, the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  demonstrates once again that we have today in Australia a government which is simply not interested in the affairs of state, the most essential one of which is the safeguarding of the **security** and integrity of the people and of their sessions.

* The **security** of Australia is too important to be handled lightly and to be merely passed over because this legislation is the result of the Tange report.

* When operatives of the **security** service obtain the right to listen in to telephone conversations, something over and above the individual's guarantee of privacy is lost.

* And the dividend to be secured through such government is not in individual happiness alone, but in the development, well-being and **security** of society itself.

* A particular aspect of this argument is stimulated not by conservationists generally but by a small group which will stimulate argument whenever the **security** or stability of this country is at stake.

* It is rather strange that the same group of people will always be active, will always come forward and will always get dramatically interested and demonstrate when anything which provides **security** for this country or something which is of major concern to our **security** is being argued.

* In addition to the increases in war pensions, there will also be increases in Service pension rates that flow automatically from proposals that my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has already announced.

* The proposed increases in age and invalid pensions foreshadowed by my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will, under the provisions of the Repatriation Act 1920-1973, automatically flow on to Service pensions.

* If circumstances were to arise that required either police or **security** scrutiny of a member of parliament, the person entitled to authorise scrutiny would, as in the case of the scrutiny of other citizens, be an appropriate police officer or (in **security** matters) the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization.

* -Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to serious concern within the Greek community over the treatment of people involved in inquiries into alleged social **security** frauds?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** is concerned about some new by-laws, drawn up by the Australian Postal Commission, which, among other things, would not enable mail to be redirected.

* I rise partly to congratulate the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Bishop)  on the legislation that has been introduced as part of the Government's general legislative programme for social **security** in respect of repatriation and other pensioners and partly to raise one particular case for the attention of the Minister.

* The 
The Government is very concerned about the increased evidence that has become available to it of abuse of social service benefits and allegations of abuses in the areas of social **security** benefits, health benefits and education allowances.

* Indeed a number of actions have already been taken in the social **security** area to lessen the opportunity for fraud.

* First, there is an immense discrepancy between the policy speech of the Prime Minister and the statement put out recently by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* On page 12 the Prime Minister's policy speech states simply this: 
But the statement put out by the Minister for Social **Security** on 20th March 1973 read: 
Reference needs to be made in this debate to the approach of the Australian Labor Party.

* On that occasion there was a tied vote- 22 to 22- on a motion by one of the delegates that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation be abolished altogether.

* This action is recorded in our history as the greatest invasion of **security** possible and a violation of human rights.

* This legislation follows from the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** commissioned by the  Hon.

* His  action and the tabling of the Hope report by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  for the first time enabled this Parliament- and through the Parliament the people of Australia- to be accurately advised of the background and needs of the Australian **security** system.

* We need a highly competent professional system of intelligence and a **security** service to ensure that our country and way of life are not imperilled.

* that a balance between the rights of individual persons and the preservation of the **security** of Australia as a nation is no simple or easy thing to achieve.

* The Government believes- I fully support its viewthat for purposes of social restraint and national **security** it is necessary to have the legal rules as contained in the various Bills we are debating.

* It would appear that the operations of ASIO established in 1 956 have resulted in safeguarding our **security** through its modus operandi.

* alleged operations of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* The declared policy of the Government is consistent with its responsibility to **security** as opposed to the open policy adopted by the Labor Party's representative, the Honourable Kep Enderby, as I have already illustrated.

* All thinking Australians who are concerned about the **security** of the nation would adopt the policy of the Government in office prior to 1972 which is the policy being pursued under this legislation as opposed to the blaring out of information by the Honourable Kep Enderby.

* It is right to continue the practice of tilting the balance in favour of offering greater protection to the **security** of the State, rather than in the direction of the safeguarding the rights of the individual.

* I repeat that the Conference of Privy Councillors- the greatest legal authority- has said that it would favour protection for the **security** of the State rather than safeguarding the rights of the individual.

* The quandary we face in legislation of this type is the same for all governments which operate **security** systems.

* The final point on which I desire to comment relates to that section of the legislation dealing with **security** assessments.

* Most Australians surveyed would compliment the Government on its decision that ASIO's **security** assessments should be subject to an appeals system.

* Where a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory (other than the  Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act  1977) provides that a class of decisions that an authority or person is authorized or required to make in respect of prescribed administrative action is subject to appeal or review and empowers a tribunal, body or person to reverse or vary such a decision, or to direct the reversal or variation of such a decision, as a result of an appeal or review, the findings of the **Security** Appeals Tribunal on a relevant review under this Part are binding on that authority or person in making such a decision, and are also binding on that tribunal, body or person in exercising powers in or in connection with an appeal or review in respect of such a decision.

* We must at all times remember that the **security** of our nation is of fundamental importance to the preservation of our way of life.

* In the final analysis, there is nothing that must not be done to safeguard the **security** of our great Australian nation.

* -On this occasion I wish to confine my remarks to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill and the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Bill.

* On that occasion a very significant directive was issued which stated that the **security** service formed part of the Attorney-General's Department and that the Attorney-General was to be responsible for it to the Parliament.

* It is worth emphasising that following the undertaking contained in his policy speech on 29 April 1974 the Prime Minister established a commission of inquiry under  Mr Justice  Hope to conduct a judicial inquiry into the structure of the Australian **security** service and into methods of reviewing decisions adversely affecting citizens or migrants.

* What we must keep in mind, however, is that to date no Australian Prime Minister has ever had the responsibility before Parliament for the **security** organisation as it is presently constituted.

* But  Mr Whitlam  's attitude is in contrast to that of  Mr Chifley,  who set the tone as to how Parliament should consider questions concerning ASIO when he emphasised in this House on 9 June 1949 that 'the Director-General had been given complete authority on **security** matters' and that he did not propose to interfere with him in the discharge of his functions.

* Firstly, to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to **security** and, at the discretion of the Director-General, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner, as the Director-General considers to be in the interests of **security**; secondly, to advise Ministers, where the Director-General is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to do so, in respect of matters relevant to **security**, insofar as those matters relate to departments of State administered by them or to authorities of the Commonwealth established by or under Acts administered by them; and thirdly, to co-operate with such departments of State and authorities of the Commonwealth and, so far as is practicable, with such departments and authorities of the States and of other countries as are capable of assisting the Organisation in the performance of its functions.

* I will not discuss in detail in this House the proposed activities of the new **security** organisation.

* Regrettably, however, there has always been a tendency for some people to take the view that we need not have **security** organisations.

* Unfortunately, every country- I emphasie that, every country- has a form of internal **security**.

* An effective internal intelligence organisation such as ASIO must be devoted to protecting Australia's internal **security**.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
It is probably very difficult for people like the 2 senior men in the present coalition Government to understand the problems of a substantially migrant, working class electorate in which more than 25 per cent of the voters are recipients of social **security** payments.

* Secondly, the fruit acquired by a statutory marketing authority would be **security** for advances to growers.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Department of Social **Security** does not employ any staff on the apprehension of persons illegally receiving unemployment benefits.

* There are a number of staff in the Department, in various occupational categories, whose duties are in some way connected with the identification and investigation of persons who may be receiving social **security** payments illegally.

* Briefly, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to borrow moneys from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and to give **security** and issue securities in respect of borrowings other than from the Commonwealth, to enable the Treasurer to guarantee repayment by the Commission of moneysborrowed other than from the Commonwealthand to provide that where securities are issued by the Commission, repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth.

* Clause 6 of the Bill amends a number of financial provisions of the existing Act In relation Lo borrowings by the Commission the amendments, which are in line with borrowing powers of other Commonwealth authorities, provide that the Commission may borrow moneys from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and may give **security** and issue securities in respect of borrowings.

* Look at what the Whitlam Government did in the field of social **security**.

* Will he consider also whether such a system would give pause to union leaders in that it would threaten **security** of employment in those areas of activity endeavouring to take advantage of our outdated tariff structure?

* It mentions also the Government's neglect of national **security** and defence.

* The first is an issue which is really shared between that Department and the Department of Social **Security**.

* I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)-  I am sure he agrees with me that such a disincentive should not exist for former citizens of Germany to become Australian citizens- to initiate discussions again with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* Why is there not a general requirement to report subject to the ability of the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  to restrict reporting for **security** or other reasons as set out in the Bill?

* In this regard also we find it difficult to understand why there is provision for regulations to exclude from efficiency audits such bodies as the Defence Force, the Commonwealth Teaching Service, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force.

* Insofar as **security** or other reasons would make public reportage undesirable, the provisions for the Attorney-General to issue a certificate restricting reportage on certain bodies would seem to be sufficient protection.

* As I told the House over 2 months ago in introducing my Bill, when I was in Italy last January I had no difficulty in securing a volume of bilateral treaties and conventions which Italy has made on social **security**, not only with European Economic Community countries but with other countries which are not in the Community such as Yugoslavia, the Iberian and Scandinavian countries and also Brazil and Argentina.

* I merely refer to this to show that Italy has had no difficulty whatever in making arrangements on social **security** with countries which have a variety of social systems.

* Article 35 of the Agreement, entitled 'Social **Security**', states: 
The 2 governments will continue to study the possibility of entering a reciprocal agreement on the payment of the benefits contemplated by the respective social **security** systems.

* There, the **security** situation has markedly improved.

* This incident which has happened raises the question of whether the **security** of Phuoc Tuy province is as soundly based as both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence have led us to believe.

* If the **security** situation in the province was as satisfactory as we have been led to believe, there would not be any Vietcong corridors across the minefield.

* Is it then not true that the South Vietnamese forces have developed that capacity which the Prime Minister in his statement on 18th August suggested they have now developed to look after the **security** of their own country and, more particularly, that province in which so much Australian effort has been expended?

* We do not want to know all of the details but what we want is an assurance, which has been given by the Minister for the Army, that everything will be done to protect the **security** of the Australian Task Force.

* As I said before, the other side of the story will be made known only in the long term when it can be established to what extent the South Vietnamese Government is able to maintain **security** in the area.

* We are concerned today with the **security** of the Australian Task Force and we want to make quite sure - as much as anyone in the Parliament can be sure - that the Task Force is withdrawn as one cohesive unit and that the withdrawal is properly protected.

* The Government and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in this vital area, continue to attempt to force on Australians a scheme which will result in a poorer medical service and at the same time restrict  -  I use the word restrict deliberately - the freedom of choice of doctor and hospital.

* The nation's **security** is the prime responsibility of government.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I have seen the resolution of the police, and I think all members of Parliament would appreciate the call that is made on them to assist in the maintenance of law and order and to assist the police in this regard.

* I think that anyone who upholds our system of parliamentary democracy, under which the Parliament passes our laws and the police, under ministerial control, see that those laws are carried out, has a vested interest because of his own **security** and safety to see that every support is given to the police.

* Nevertheless, the Australian Government views the continuing bloodshed and destruction with concern and anxiety, and repeats its hope that conditions of peace, order and **security** will be restored as soon as possible.

* He went on, however, to indicate that those American ground forces remaining in South Vietnam would have a continuing **security** or combat role in the protection of the entire remaining American force, which will include air, artillery and logistic support units.

* It follows a period of progress during which the Government of the Republic of Vietnam has increasingly shifted the responsibility for local **security** to regional forces whose improved performance has progressively allowed the regular armed forces- the ARVN - to undertake operations against enemy main force units, as well as to undertake cross-border operations.

* That all words after 'That' bc omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: while not opposing the Bill the House is of opinion that the only satisfactory way to provide social service benefits is through a comprehensive national system of social **security** where benefits are above the poverty level and tied to an index adjusted at least annually'.

* 1 ) Are the physical **security** measures used to protect the plutonium stored at Maralinga the same as those set out in the International Atomic Energy Agency Information Circular 225 of September 1975, entitled  The Physical Protection qf Nuclear Material.

* If not, why are the IAEA physical **security** measures not in use at Maralinga.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Australia has not concluded any comprehensive reciprocal agreements on social **security** since 8 March 1978.

* Social **Security** Agreement with Malta  (Question No.

* The balance will remain at call as **security** for any borrowings by the Bank on international capital markets to supplement its subscribed capital.

* However, the banks, too, had noted the problems which companies faced in raising sufficient **security** for loans.

* Their position was that, in very many cases, only EPIC payments insurance, and guarantees, would provide companies with the necessary **security** for the long term financial accommodation they would need to be able to tender for Bougainville contracts on competitive terms.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What is a more important reason for our support is that there was acknowledgment by the Australian Government of the importance of the need for Papua New Guinea to have the transfer of this responsibility made as soon as possible.

* Inter alia, the decisions on the matters before us covered, firstly, the transfer of the responsibility for the Papua New Guinea Public Service and the Public Service aspects of statutory authorities from the Minister for External Territories to local executive authority by August 1973; secondly, the implementation of the recommendations by  Mr Moxon  Simpson on arrangements appropriate for the employment **security** of overseas officers in the Papua New Guinea Public Service; and, thirdly, the transfer of the AuditorGeneral's function in respect of Papua New Guinea to a Papua New Guinea AuditorGeneral.

* The problem of employment **security** for overseas officers was long drawn out, to say the least.

* Last year, when Cabinet endorsed my suggestion that  Mr Simpson  should be appointed to conduct a full scale, independent inquiry into both the employment **security** of overseas officers and the provision of future staff by Australia, I suspect - indeed, I was told - that few people other than the officers in the Department of External Territories and myself believed that  Mr Simpson  would be successful in recommending acceptable and appropriate solutions.

* to consider the ability of Papua New Guinea to meet the financial liabilities under the employment **security** arrangements which I consider should be made as a result of my inquiry.

* Thus their terms and conditions of service, superannuation and retirement benefits and employment **security** arrangements will be covered by Australian legislation.

* If this had been done it would have wiped out the black marketing and lt would have given some collateral and **security** to the country side.

* 1 ) As a result ofthe Hayden Budget and other changes to the taxation and social **security** systems over the past few years some pensioners not previously liable to pay tax have been called on to pay tax, while others have experienced an increase in tax liability.

* The Taxation Office and the Department of Social **Security** are, by leaflets and other material, providing age pensioners with information about their liability to pay tax in the event that their taxable income is above the level where tax becomes payable.

* That means it is the second Bill brought in by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  this session to amend the National Health Act.

* The Minister for Social **Security** in his second reading speech mentioned uncertainty of power.

* This problem between the health funds and the Minister for Social **Security** will continue.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
What ate the factors responsible for delaying the concluding of a reciprocal agreement on social **security** with West Germany.

* Instead he believes that the present unjustifiable imbalance of national wealth should be further aggravated by redistributing a greater share of the national wealth from the workers and social **security** beneficiaries to the top ten per cent of Australia's income earners.

* In the 1976-77 Budget Medibank was slashed by $450m; health services were doubled; programmed expenditure on four education commissions was reduced by $172m; tuition fees for second and higher degrees were reintroduced; taxing of social **security** pensions and benefits was introduced; grants for senior citizens centres were terminated; expenditure on sickness and unemployment benefits was cut by $33m; subsidies for aged persons homes were reduced by SO per cent; funding for the Australian Assistance Plan was completely withdrawn; funding for the Aboriginal people was cut by 30 per cent in real terms; the Labor Government's programs for urban and regional development were virtually destroyed; funds for the school dental service were frozen; the legal aid service was strangled before it had a chance to function; child care services were savagely cut back, and despite all these cuts in government expenditure, taxes were also increased by 25 per cent and the Government did everything in its power to curb wage increases, with the result that over the year average wages fell by $ 1 1 .50 a week.

* Education, aged persons' accommodation, social **security** pensions, benefits and programs, growth centres, community health services, migrant services, Aboriginal affairs, urban rehabilitation and housing are some of the vitally important areas of government responsibility which have also gone wanting in this Budget.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) the advisability of hiring a Hong Kong based, wholly foreign-owned company to carry out surveillance functions involving the protection and **security** of remote areas of Australian sovereign territory and coastline; 
I support the amendment moved by the Opposition in relation to this legislation, the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill, which refers particularly to the levels of subsidy of 75 cents a day for accommodation and 25 cents a meal for those institutions that provide accommodation or meals for homeless people.

* The legislation was one of the initiatives of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden ) when he was Minister for Social **Security**.

* Are these lessons, for people who are sometimes well able to pay for them, regarded as having a higher priority than measures aimed at alleviating poverty or other social **security** measures.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question 
The fostering of such exchanges of staff between the public and private sectors is supported by the Government and the Department of Social **Security** is presently examining ways of giving effect to the Government s wishes.

* This may be the only way in which a real appreciation of the problem can be given to the majority of Australians living in the **security** of the southern and eastern coastline.

* Australia **security**, Australian jobs and to an extent Australian drug risks are as great and as important as health problems in respect of the exotic and other diseases associated with the boat people.

* In all areas of defence, **security**, health, immigration, foreign affairs and drug trafficking we should be alert to the dangers and change accordingly.

* I suggest that Australia establish some offshore base on an island on which all the necessary **security** and health checks that are required could be conducted before these people arrive in Australia.

* AUSTRALIAN **SECURITY** INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION 
My meeting with the Prime Minister on 17 March took place at my request.

* Also, I was seriously disturbed about the future of the Organisation and the implications for **security** in Australia.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Was the telex message that was drafted and issued by the DirectorGeneral of **Security** in the same text as that which has been published in the newspapers?

* In any lasting Middle East peace settlement whereby all parties genuinely concede the right of every state in the area to live in peace and **security** there is a need to take account of a number of geo-strategic factors which are outlined in this report.

* Apart from the threat to Australia's oil imports, our **security** is unlikely to be directly threatened by a military conflict in the Middle East.

* The basis of Australia's action should be the recognition of Israel's right to exist in **security**, and the encouragement of Arab initiatives to settle the displaced Palestinians.

* This may require support for the resumption of United States step-by-step diplomacy, should the parties to the dispute become disenchanted with the Geneva Peace 
Until such time as Lebanon can build up strong enough **security** forces to curb Palestinian forces in southern Lebanon, Australia should support the establishment in Lebanon's troubled southern border area of an effective international peace-keeping force to be drawn from disinterested powers.

* This fall in living standards- this slide in personal incomes and individual welfare and **security**- is so novel and dramatic a phenomenon that the Australian people have yet to grasp its implications.

* The Labor Party does not see personal prosperity and **security** purely in terms of cash rewards- of money in the pocket.

* Labor insists that the measure of real prosperity, real **security** and true well-being is to be found not only in wages but in the services which governments provide for their people and for the whole community.

* Complete evaluation of the extent of the risk and assessment of what course should be followed to reduce it involve matters of national **security** and international relations which are beyond the ambit of the Inquiry.

* The growth of the nuclear industry throughout the world brings with it a significant threat to the **security** of the world.

* But the breeding of plutonium gravely threatens the **security** and health of the world.

* This would explore the economic, resource, environmental and waste disposal characteristics of different reactor technologies and fuel cycles with a view to solving safeguards, physical **security** and non-proliferation problems.

* The Opposition supports this but has slight reservations about the manner in which the Government has made the amendment and the method that is being used to increase the benefit, namely, the widening of the discretion of the Director-General of Social **Security**.

* I refer to the doublespeak of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  representing the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  when giving the second reading speech he said: 
I would like now to make a few comments on the Government's announced intention, both by statement by the Minister for Social **Security** and by a foreshadowed amendment by the Minister for Health to amend this Bill in the Committee stage for the purpose of bringing in a lone father's benefit similar to the supporting mothers' benefit.

* It takes a long time to get it at ordinary times; but Christmas, with all due respect to the Department of Social **Security**, is not one of the times when one obtains the fastest response from any government department.

* There may be the case of a widow, or any other person receiving social **security** benefits, whose children have been entitled to a benefit of, I think, $7.50.

* That child then has the additional costs of trying to find a job- the costs of going to the Commonwealth Employment Service office, going to the office of the Department of Social **Security**, ringing up, buying newspapers which advertise jobs and that sort of thing.

* Hopefully, by then, the present Opposition will be in government and hopefully new instructions will be issued by a new Minister for Social **Security**.

* I refer to Australia's Director-General of **Security** and the head of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* He was admitted to the Bar in the State of Victoria in 195 1, became a judge in 1972 and was appointed Australia's Director-General of **Security** in 1976.

* 1 am more convinced than ever before, after observing the man at close quarters following two intensive meetings involving a deliberation in excess of six hours, that in that office he combines a judicial appreciation of the rule of law under a parliamentary democracy, together with an understanding of the rights of the individual Australian and of the necessity to ensure the national **security** of Australia.

* But above all his patriotic determination to ensure and protect the national **security** of the Commonwealth sets an example which I believe many who wish to emulate him could follow to great advantage.

* I hope that  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Woodward will be available for many years to serve this nation as Director-General of **Security**.

* I met the man only as recently as two weeks ago but having had the opportunity to cross-examine him and to hear him answer a wide range of questions directed to the national **security** of Australia, he is in my judgment a fine Australian and a most worthy trustee of the nation 's **security**.

* I noticed that neither the honourable member for Griffith nor the seconder of his motion, the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett),  made direct reference to the level of social **security** payments in this country.

* They know that the Whitlam Government's performance in the field of social **security** is without parallel in the history of this country.

* This Government has provided record and unprecedented increases in all levels of social **security**.

* I do not think anybody could quarrel seriously with the contention that the level of pensions and payments to all beneficiaries of social **security** in Australia is far better than it has ever been before.

* I am not speaking here just in terms of the simple payment of social **security** benefits but of the provision of a wide range of services which have been introduced under Federal programs or Australian Government financed programs since 1972.

* Certainly there is no undertaking to improve the rate of social **security** payments which have been provided by this Government and of which we are very proud.

* The Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Rehabilitation (SIDCOR) comprises representative from the Departments of the Special Minister of State (chair), Education, Health, Labor and Immigration, Repatriation and Compensation, Social **Security** and the Treasury, and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and the Social Welfare Commission.

* Steve Biko died as a result of **security** police inflicted head injuries which then led to massive brain damage and kidney failure.

* The death of this young black African leader once again concentrated international concern on the practices of the **security** police in the state which created apartheid.

* In it he lists the names of 45 political detainees who have died at the hands of the Nationalist Government's **security** policy.

* The following South Africans are known to have died in detention in the hands of the Nationalist government's **Security** Police.

* The causes of death alleged by the **Security** Police are given in brackets.

* However, 90 per cent of this amount will remain on call as **security** for the IBRD's own borrowing operations on world capital markets, and only 10 per cent, that is $US9.4m is actually payable.

* The Government is in the process of developing a high **security** infectious unit at the Fairfield Hospital in Melbourne.

* It will favour the establishment of a system of world food **security** and the establishment of world grain stocks to be negotiated in the appropriate trade forums of the world.

* The policies of the Australian Government are to have **security** of markets and **security** of prices with respect to quantity; and, in the other respect to help developing countries as much as we can and to explore the possibilities of providing food for foreign aid, particularly those types of food that are high in protein such as beef.

* We sought to obtain from the Queensland Government assurances that it would provide for the Aboriginal residents real self-management and real **security** of tenure for the two reserves.

* The residents of Aurukun and Mornington Island have **security** of tenure for their land and have been granted their traditional rights in a way which no other Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community in Queensland has achieved.

* So in effect they have a lease and **security** of tenure for their land for 100 years.

* The object of these discussions is to see whether, in a spirit of co-operation, a legal and administrative framework might be worked out covering all reserves so that there will be a continuing forward movement on the basis of the Commonwealth legislation and of any amendments to the Queensland legislation or further legislation which the Queensland Government might wish to pass to give effect to these twin goals of selfmanagement and **security** of tenure.

* The Commonwealth Development Bank can and does accept stock or plant mortgages as **security** for its loans.

* The Development Bank does not specifically publicise that it accepts any particular type of **security** and does not see any need to do so.

* In accordance with its chaner as laid down in the Commonwealth Banks Act, the Bank is primarily concerned with the prospects of success of an enterprise and it does not necessarily have regard to the type or value of the **security** available.

* All indications were that the **Security** Intelligence Service was, in effect, leaking information like a sieve to the Government's political opponents.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Has the Department of Social **Security** any plans to establish a National Institute of Mental Retardation.

* The third is that in matters of fundamental importance, such as **security** of life and limb, all members of society have equal rights and claims upon society.

* My fourth value judgment is that any government is responsible to its people for the protection of that physical **security**.

* We do not know too much about those decisions because it has been necessary for people who took part in them to be very careful and **security** minded about what those decisions were.

* The Minister will have noticed that people engaged in the field of **security** investment are concerned.

* I would also like to draw attention to the fact that in the money market today a lot of institutionsthe savings banks in particular and the superannuation funds- have very significant book debts in relation to their government **security** holdings.

* There will be an avalanche of people willing to sell their government **security** holdings if we move down by any significant amount.

* People should not be kept in poverty by a social **security** mechanism that has got out of date as a consequence, largely, of the economic mismanagement of this Government.

* There again in that particular area there have been numerous cases where, simply because of the inability of the migrant to understand his rights and entitlements from government departmentsthis could apply particularly in relation to the Department of Social **Security**- he has been denied those rights.

* I am afraid that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has not understood the position.

* There is fine print in the mind of the Minister for Social **Security** but it is fine print on much bigger issues than this.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 28 February 1979: 
What grants have been made by the Department of Social **Security** for special projects in the Electoral Division of Bowman and for what purposes in (a) 1975-76, (b) 1976-77,(c) 1977-78 and (d) 1978-79.

* In speaking to these setimates which deal with social **security**, welfare and health, I want to remind the Committee and the people of the nation that of the $24,32 lm estimated total Budget outlay, social **security** and welfare will account for $6, 187m or 25 per cent of the amount.

* By doing that we would at least put some stress back on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to consider fully the definition of the word 'subversion ', which is far too wide.

* As a former Prime Minister, he would know exactly what transpired on many occasions in the operation of our **security** forces.

* I basically believe that we in this country have a democracy which is robust enough to enable us to accept precision written into laws which concern **security** and intelligence and which protect the rights of every Australian person.

* The fact that major military activity has occurred and still is occurring in a country one hour's flying time from Darwin poses a serious threat to Australia's national **security**.

* This threat to our national **security** must concern every thinking Australian.

* In that case counsel for the defence- a newspaper- asked the plaintiff about a **security** report.

* So in the last 18 months, in the New South Wales courts of justice, we had a learned Queen's Counsel asking a plaintiff whether there was a **security** report about a person.

* That shows there was a definite leak from the **security** sources to that particular Queen's Counsel.

* This brings me to the point that in 1966 again a file was used in this House concerning the question of a young fellow's mother having a **security** file.

* He made the further point that they had nothing to do with **security** at all.

* When we look at the problems in Australia now we can see reasons why there ought to be **security** files kept on what is called the extreme right.

* We are unable to do so because we cannot guarantee their **security**.

* The right honourable member would not be able to go to some functions in his electorate because he would be involved, from a **security** point of view.

* I direct my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* These 17 young girls who could not find work made the effort at their own expense, time and trouble to fit themselves for jobs, but because a limit of eight hours study is imposed by the Department of Social **Security** they are not eligible for unemployment benefit.

* My question concerns the Prime Minister's statement in a recent television interview that the Government's raid on the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation was the greatest mistake that the present Government has made since it was elected to office.

* It is for this reason that ... we have prescribed a qualifying period of 20 years - which is more generous, for example, than what is done in Canada, where the qualifying period is 25 years for portability of the old age **security** pension.

* The Opposition believes that a proper immigration programme must have a basis of and work towards ensuring Australia's national and economic **security**, the welfare and integration of all its citizens and the balanced development of our nation.

* It is the intention of the Commission to borrow these moneys and it has the approval of the Government so to do to the extent that it guarantees **security** for those who may have a mind to invest in this loan.

* As a result the Labor Party is future' oriented, with a hope of improved economic **security** 'now'.

* In conclusion let me say that I too share the concern of other honourable members on this side about the proposal for extra **security** precautions in this House.

* The majority of the speech was taken up with a discussion of the organisation within not my Department but the Department of my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* It really sounded to me as though the honourable member were regurgitating the results of information given to him by some disgruntled employee within the Department of 
Social **Security** and I fail to see how I can be held responsible for the information that that person or group of people gave him.

* He admitted that it was his own Government in 1974, when it split up the Department of Immigration and moved settlement services across to the Department of Social **Security**, that caused the problem.

* I think that that probably disposes of his criticism of the organisation within the Department of Social **Security**.

* I will draw the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** to the honourable member's statements and no doubt she will be contacting him.

* Given a fair days work for a fair days pay, I believe there will be increased **security** of employments and increased opportunity for the development of such dockyards as the one at Williamstown of which we are proud.

* The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to borrow moneys from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and to give **security** and issue securities in respect of borrowings other than from the Commonwealth to enable the Treasurer to guarantee repayment by the Commission of moneysborrowed other than from the Commonwealthand to provide that where securities are issued by the Commission, repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
If there are flagrant violations of the ceasefire .

* two possible consequences follow: either the Salisbury regime's **security** forces will stay in barracks and remain ' neutral', and there may or may not be pitched battles between the followers of Muzorewa and those of the Patriotic Front; or else the **security** forces will attempt to restore 'law and order' and the British governor may find himself in charge of a continuation of the war against the guerillas.

* There can be no doubt about it because so far the forecasts have all been pretty accurate- and I hope the latest one turns out to be both accurate and a change of direction, that the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  will not go to the Ministry of Social **Security** but of Special Minister of State.

* The United Nations **Security** Council decided on 29 September to establish the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG) to assist in the implementation of the plan adopted by the **Security** Council for the early independence of Namibia, through free and fair elections.

* The plan was on the basis of proposals put forward by the five Western members of the **Security** Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada and the FRG).

* The United Nations **Security** Council, in establishing UNTAG in accordance with the United Nations SecretaryGeneral's recommendations, endorsed an upper limit of 7,500 for the force.

* South African Government will agree to the implementation of the **Security** Council plan.

* Has his attention been drawn to an article concerning Volunteer Citizens' **Security** Service Association which appeared on 21st July 1971 in the 'Aeroplane Press' a newspaper which is distributed within his electorate.

* Will he instruct the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to investigate the activities of this organisation to ascertain whether it is using facilities provided by Commonwealth or State revenue.

* Honourable members will notice that clause (2) provides in the performance of his functions under the Act the Director-General of **Security** is subject to the general directions of the Minister but that the Minister is not empowered to override the opinion of the Director-General concerning the nature of the advice that should be given by the Austraiian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth.

* The Opposition is not suggesting that the Minister should be able to direct the DirectorGeneral on whether intelligence should be collected, but that paragraph (c), which concerns advice being given by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to Ministers and departments, should be omitted so that it is clear that the Director-General must comply with the directions of the Attorney-General.

* In its present form the clause represents what we could call, and as you would be aware,  Mr Deputy Chairman,  the Salisbury formula- the relationship between government and the **security** service.

* A member of parliament may become a member of a government, take an oath of office and undertake to look after the **security** of this country.

* Its function basically is to collect information for **security** and intelligence in order to advise governments.

* It will kill more Australians, maim more Australians and put more Australians on social **security**, whether it is an invalid pension, a widow's pension or just a sickness benefit.

* But, having said that, again I make it absolutely clear that these people who have been charged in relation to alleged frauds with respect to social **security** payments have been charged as individuals , not as members of any community or as people of any ethnic community background.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 13 April 1978: 
1 ) How many of the refugees from South East Asian countries who have been granted permanent residence in Australia since 1 July 1977, are in receipt of social **security** benefits. 
)

* What categories of social **security** benefits are paid and how many former refugees are recipients in each category.

* The Department of Social **Security** was first represented in 1 97 1 .

* The Minister for Social **Security** .

* Administrators- Senior Officers of the Australian Department of Social **Security**, State Government Welfare Departments and the New Zealand and New Guinea Welfare Departments.

* Ministers- The Australian Minister for Social **Security**, State Government Welfare Ministers and Welfare 
Department of Social **Security** 
Committees- The functions of the Committees are: to examine applications for the construction or extension of hospital and nursing home accommodation where it is intended to seek approval of the premises subsequently for the payment of benefits under the National Health Act; to submit reports (to the Director-General of Social **Security**) as to the needs for the accommodation proposed in the particular locality and the number of beds which should be approved for the payment of benefits under the National Health Act; and to examine and submit reports on applications for assistance for the construction or acquisition of nursing home accommodation under the provisions of the Aged Persons Homes Act.

* One of the things on which we, the people in the country and the honourable member's constituents should reflect is not so much the words and sentiments which he expressed tonight but the contrast between those sentiments and the sentiments expressed by his senior colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* However, that is not what the Minister for Social **Security** said.

* But I would like to make it perfectly clear that I disagree with the Minister for Social **Security** and throw back into his teeth everything that he said about my colleagues in the Country Party in regard to the way in which they operated in relation to primary industry when in Government.

* I throw back into the teeth of the Minister for Social **Security** the accusations made by him.

* I ask the honourable member for Riverina, in good conscience to his own constituents, at some stage to place in print in the local newspapers in his electorate the speech which he made tonight side by side with the speech made by the Minister for Social **Security** in order to show the contrast.

* I invite his constituents to consider just how much weight he will carry, as one of the few representa tives in his Party of rural areas in Australia, against the heavyweight Minister for Social **Security** who is the fourth most important Minister in the Cabinet and who is backed up by a vast array of Ministers, almost threequarters of whom come from the metropolitan cities of Australia.

* The Labor Party has demonstrated in a very short 9 or 10 months in office that it does not care a damn about primary industries and country people, and the speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  tonight was a good demonstration of that.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Who issued invitations for the official opening of the regional office of the Department of Social **Security** at Rockingham, Western Australia, on 1 3 September 1 974.

* All decision makers, legislators and administrators, as well as citizens, are coming to recognise the importance of these interrelationships between economic policies, social policies, social **security** policies and welfare programs and those decisions which appear to have a direct spatial implication.

* Revenue Fund that all expenditures on social **security** are now met.

* A  new kind of safe, high yield **security** for 
The Government received that IDC report.

* I think as a matter of courtesy- and given the fact that this is not such a controversial matter in the sense of a government standing or falling or, more extremely, the **security** of a country being at stake, or some paramountly confidential Cabinet matter was involved in the IDC finding- that that IDC report should be available to members of this Parliament and to members of the Australian community.

* He said that the assistance was being provided only to win the support of the people, ls it not natural that you win the support of the people and even of the Government if you give to them a degree of **security** and stability?

* I support him and, as I have said in this House before we desire peace with all our heart and with all our mind, but we desire a peace which will last into the future and give **security** and safety to the people of South Vietnam.

* I reject on behalf of everybody on my side the sordid allegation made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that the Opposition bows to vested interests.

* I am not suggesting that the Minister for Social **Security** or any member of the Australian Labor Party does not have the same basic concern about these values as we do.

* In a time of an oil crisis the Government has rendered Australia - 
The Minister for Social **Security**, in September 1972, said: 
This Bill makes the Minister for Social **Security** a latter day Don Corleone as far as the private hospitals are concerned.

* Plainly the Prime Minister regarded the effect of the North Vietnamese presence in Cambodia as marginal to Australian **security**.

* They involve departments and institutions other than my own - Education, Labour, Social **Security**, Environment and Conservation, Urban and Regional Development, the Council for the Arts and the like.

* The Prime Minister- and I am sure some of the oncers opposite must have been dismayed, but outwardly they agree with what was done- has adopted a pro-Mao anti-Soviet stance to try to show the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a dangerous threat to our **security** in order to distract public attention away from the extreme hardships the Government is intent on creating for most Australians.

* By its own actions, the Government has valued the magnitude of the Soviet threat to our **security** as being worth something less than the 15 per cent freight discount available from the Soviet line Fesco.

* **Security** checks of freight and luggage, other than hand luggage, are performed by both domestic and international airlines only at times of increased **security** alert.

* Luggage not accompanied by a passenger is subjected to manual searching before it is carried and freight deposited by an individual or by shippers who are not known to the airline is not carried during the period of the alert 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
We noticed that the Government has not fallen down on its promises concerning training programs.

* As for those who need social **security** and welfare payments, it is interesting to note that the Budget provides $8 billion to help the family, the handicapped and the aged.

* It is my view that strategically it is downright nonsense and even dangerous from a national **security** point of view for us to plan on using imported petroleum in the years ahead because even if we mobilised now we would have only 90 days of petrol available to the nation.

* A further examination will show that the basis of the speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was incorrect.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said in his second reading speech that when the Liberal-Country Party Government lost office in December 1972 the pension was 20 per cent of the then average weekly earnings.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has claimed that the Government is gaining on the 25 per cent objective.

* Two weeks ago we had statements by the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Social **Security** that they are going to take a tougher line on the payment of unemployment benefits.

* Yet in his speech last night the Minister for Social **Security** seemed to dissociate himself from a tougher line attitude.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said in effect: We have been in office for half the time in which we promised the target would be achieved and we are over half way towards the magical figure'.

* For the current financial year up to 30 April 1 978, the proportion of total social **security** cash benefit payments spent on each category is as follows: 
I have been interested in this problem ever since we introduced the Customs Amendment Act in May of this year.

* It provided for information obtained by Customs officers to be conveyed to police organisations as well as the **security** service.

* So far as I am concerned, it is right and proper that any such information should be conveyed to the **security** service, but I have very grave doubts whether it is proper in a society such as ours that there should be an ability to pass on this type of special information to the police that could be prejudicial to the rights of the individual.

* None of us can doubt that one of the greatest problems we face, apart from a threat to **security**, is the extent to which narcotics are used and the damage they do to people of all classes and sections of the community.

* I refer to the Hope Committee report on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and other reports.

* Here we have another indication of the fact that it is for the Parliament to exercise caution and to protect the rights of the individual, unless its actions are manifestly shown to be in the **security** interests of the Commonwealth and of the people of the Commonwealth and that they are necessary in the case of narcotics abuse or narcotics use, unless such use has been authorised by an authorised medical officer.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Opposition Parties reject the Constitution Alteration (Prices) Bill because this Bill is no more than a further reflection of this Government's distorted and misconceived approach to Australia's inflationary problem.

* The speech just made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is in fact a classic case of that distortion.

* The Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for the Capital Territory, who is acting in his usual jabbering and incompetent manner, know that they cannot deny the total logic of this proposition.

* The Minister for Social **Security** unfortunately made reference to the experience of some of the smaller European countries.

* Minister for Social **Security** either does not know - and if that is the case he stands indicted by this House- or, if he does know, has put before this House a totally distorted impression which international experience and fact certainly bears out.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 April 1978: 
1 ) How many persons in the Electoral Division of Kingston currently receive pensions or other benefits from the Department of Social **Security**.

* They are simply concerned with its effectiveness and with the way in which the producers of the programs are able to go about their tasks and how happy they are about their **security**.

* Daily he refuses to support their applications to his colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* The Minister would do well to use his influence with his colleagues- the Minister for Social **Security**, especially, and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)-  to improve this situation.

* As the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr lnnes)  said, there are far too many bureaucrats here in Canberra and far too many people in supervisory roles in the State offices of the Department of Social **Security** who are responsible for the provision of migrant welfare services and who are not familiar with what is going on in the field.

* The honourable member for Melbourne instanced the absence of Arabic-speaking skills within the Department of Social **Security** in Sydney.

* At the moment in Parramatta we have 13 Commonwealth departments in rented space such as the Department of Health, the Australian Electoral Office, the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Bureau of Customs, the Family Court, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, two Medibank offices, an office of Qantas Airways Ltd, two social **security** offices, a branch of the Taxation Office with 1,000 people working in rented space and Telecom Australia.

* The greatest disservice this Government has done to Australia has been to pursue policies which have led to the disenchantment of the United States with any form of involvement and any form of commitment for the peace and **security** of South East Asia.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Government cannot accept this amendment by the Opposition.

* In relation to the meaning ofsubversion, clause 5 ( 1 ) (b) states:  activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth; 
Therefore, the act which is kept under surveillance must be an act which is judged to be directed to this purpose- to obstruct, hinder or interfere with the performance of the Defence Force.

* Why should that activity be rendered unlawful or kept under surveillance by the **security** organisation?

* The Opposition is suggesting that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation could not keep that person under surveillance prior to his placing the bomb and triggering it off with the purpose of obstructing the performance by the Defence Force of its functions.

* It is quite clear then that the **security** authorities must have the capacity to keep under surveillance activities, either lawful or unlawful, directed to the matters stated in the clause.

* They are activities 'directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of **security** or the defence of the Commonwealth.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Prime Minister initially wrote to Premiers on 22 August 1977.

* Further communication is now taking place with Premiers and with those Ministers nominated by Premiers to be the point of contact for the Minister for Social **Security**.

* It was on that basis that we suggested that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted and that it provide, for example, for annual reports to the Parliament so that the Parliament itself could be fully informed of the activities of the intelligence organisation; that there be a regular, periodic judicial audit so that the guarantee was there that the organisation had complied with its charter and that it did not interfere with civil liberties; that it operated effectively and efficiently; that the responsible Minister be fully informed by the Director-General of ASIO on all matters other than the contents of files relating to particular individuals; that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects if he so wished; that there be proper financial accountability of ASIO; that there be a redefinition of the concept of **security** and, in particular, the element of subversion in order to narrow its scope and limit the possibility of its misapplication; that the restriction of circumstances in which the times at which warrants may be issued also be properly controlled; that a **security** appeals system be given retrospective operation as recommended by the Hope report; that no person be denied notification of the existence of an adverse **security** assessment; and that communication of information purporting to identify an ASIO employee or agent be penalised only when such information would endanger the safety of such person or persons.

* He made the point that the operations of the Special Branch really had nothing to do with the intelligence organisation or **security** of this country, but had a lot to do with the politics of this country and that there was no real control or direction as to what intelligence was all about.

* They were based, rather, on the unreasoned assumption that any persons who thought or acted less conservatively than suited the **security** force were likely to be potential dangers to the **security** of the nation.

* The words  Mr Justice  White used to describe the **security** recording system of South Australia were that it was 'wasteful' and it was 'objectionable'.

* Not only is the type of **security** checking objectionable on the grounds of civil liberties; it is also extremely wasteful of ASIO 's limited resources to identify those few people who will be genuine **security** risks.

* Operations such as that conducted by the South Australian Special Branch, and clearly also by ASIO in the past in conducting surveillance and maintaining files on people who are clearly not **security** risks, are not only a gross and unjustified infringement of civil liberties; they are an absurd waste of time and a waste of public money.

* They are basically to collect **security** intelligence in order to advise governments.

* The use of Federal Bureau of Investigation **Security** records for political purposes is well established overseas.

* In answering the allegation the then Minister for the Army tried to discredit the boy by reading from the **security** file relating to the boy's mother.

* That he had read from the **security** file was confirmed the next afternoon at Question Time by the then Prime Minister,  Mr Holt.

* However, somewhat different considerations apply in relation to **security**.

* **Security** matters are not capable of the same precise judicial testing as are law enforcement matters.

* Judicial warrants are essential in Customs and telecommunications matters but on the question of **security** we want political accountability.

* I must remind myself that he was talking about 1973- by what  Senator Murphy  may have done in relation to **security** matters when he was Attorney-General.

* We need not disclose information which would not be consistent with **security** requirements.

* The question of **security** must always be considered within the narrow concept of what we are about- that Ministers are responsible to Parliament and that the real issues are terrorism and espionage.

* I think it is appropriate to repeat the point that the Opposition fully understands the need for **security** in this country.

* Again I make the point that in between times many unsatisfactory performances were seen and they had nothing to do with intelligence or the need for **security** in this country.

* One of the major objections to the ASIO Bill is that **security** assessments could be provided to others- for example, to State instrumentalities.

* Therefore, we want to provide for retrospectivity in relation to appeals on **security** assessments, as was recommended by  Mr Justice  Hope.

* A person's right to go before a tribunal is dependent on his being notified of an adverse **security** assessment.

* As I have said, on behalf of the Opposition I move: 
that regular periodic judicial audit be conducted into the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization to ensure- 
that the responsible Minister be fully informed by the Director-General of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization with respect to any matter, other than the contents of files relating to particular individuals, on which he has sought information and advice; 
that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects of the operation of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization, including the exercise of its Special Powers under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill; 
the proper financial accountability of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization, including the auditing of its accounts by the Auditor-General, as recommended by the Hope Report; 
the redefinition of the concept of '**security**', and in particular the element of 'subversion', in order to narrow its scope and limit the possibility of its misapplication; 
that the **security** appeals system be given retrospective operation as recommended in the Hope Report; 
that no person be denied notification of the existence of an adverse **security** assessment made about that person; and 
the communication of information purporting to identify an Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization employee or agent to be penalised only when such information would endanger the safety of such person or itself be seriously prejudicial to **security**".

* I submit that increased income, social service benefits and the like, are meaningless if the **security** of the nation is in doubt, at risk or at worse in jeopardy.

* It must be realised that national **security** is the foundation on which all other securities rest.

* It must embark on a course to make defence an issue in this country, to improve our defences and to be able to live with some measure of **security** in a threatening world environment.

* The estimate provided by the Department of Social **Security** is that, on the assumption that the previous conditions of eligibility as well as the previous rates of child endowment had been maintained, the full-year cost of child endowment would have been some $230m.

* Consequently at every opportunity - during election campaigns and at other times - members of the other side of the House criticised this Party and its members for being disloyal, for being procommunist, for being opposed to Australia's **security** and all those things that went with it.

* Demonstrations throughout the nation by people from all walks of life indicated that they realised the falsity of the Government's charge that Australia's **security** was involved in Vietnam.

* We find that in that part of the world today, far from getting any thanks for being associated with the Americans in Vietnam, we are discredited as people who have gone onto foreign soil, ravaged the country and in every way contributed not so much to the **security** of that country but to the destruction of its way of life.

* Therefore today as we pay a tribute to the valour of those who served, as we pay a tribute to those who suffer today, to the relatives of those who did not come back, let us ponder from our own position in this Parliament what our guilt is in involving these men and their dependants in this conflict which was never a declared war, in which our **security** was never endangered and for which we are suffering today.

* The Labor Party's policies pay no regard whatever to Australia's continuing strategic interest, which is an interest in the **security** of small countries.

* Does he not understand that China is seeking the elimination of the United States presence and **security** support for South East and East Asia and the Western Pacific area which means the destruction of ANZUS, the withdrawal of bases in Australia and the withdrawal of forces and troops including the Seventh Fleet and all the rest right down the Western Pacific?

* How inhuman it is to separate families at this time, when above all else, migrants need the  comfort and **security** of their family.

* Let us look at some of the developments that the Government has had to face through changes in the nature of our population and in social **security** commitments.

* In June last year, 1000 workers in the work force were supporting 276 pensioners and other social **security** beneficiaries.

* Through the increase in eligibility for various social **security** pensions which has taken place over a period and because of the change in the age structure of the population, there has been an enormous increase in the commitment by government to social **security** pensioners.

* That is a factor that must be borne in mind when we look at the budgetary implications 
I turn again to the total Budget outlay on social **security**.

* So, let that fact give the he to those honourable members who claim that this Government is responsible for substantial cutbacks in social **security** benefits and welfare expenditure generally 
I repeat that in a year of budgetary restraint there has been an increase of 7 per cent in the total welfare budget.

* About two million people, or roughly 15 per cent of the Australian population, receive the bulk of their income from the social **security** system.

* When we take into account 1.2 million age pensioners, over 250,000 invalid pensioners and all the other categories of social **security** beneficiaries, we have about two million people, or 15 per cent of the Australian population, receiving the bulk of their income from the social **security** system.

* In outlining the substantial commitment of the Government to assist age pensioners and other categories of social **security** beneficiaries, I draw attention to the total effect if each of us were to put forward a private member's BUI which would increase expenditure, whether on pensions, on the extension of fringe benefits to categories of pensioners who now do not qualify, on the extension of eligibility for certain benefits, such as domiciliary nursing care- which, because of a particular institution would aid greatly a number of people in my electorate- or a number of other benefits, such as taxation concessions, which we would all like to introduce for various categories of people in our community.

* I want now to comment on some of the remarks that have been made from time to time about so-called cutbacks by this Government in the provision of social **security** and welfare benefits.

* These small states look to Australia for economic assistance, for guidance and leadership in major diplomatic issues and, in the final analysis, for **security** should their national integrity ever by threatened by some outside power.

* A stable, friendly Indonesia is an imperative in the overall perspective of Australian **security**.

* Indonesian fears that Timor would pose a threat to her **security** also seem exaggerated.

* These are unfortunate developments which, it would seem, could be avoided if Portuguese Timor's 2 powerful neighbours, Australia and Indonesia, could join together in helping the people find a just and free solution to their future status, the outcome of which would surely carry obvious advantages in terms of both **security** and goodwill in Indonesia.

* It would give greater **security** and hope to the wool grower than the scheme encompassed by this measure.

* There is a manual called 'Protective **Security** Handbook'- 
I applaud the activity taking place under the Asian Development Bank.

* I am very glad that we have no direct tie-up in terms of **security**, foreign policy or matters of that kind.

* It will enable a de facto spouse to be joined with the eligible person in the **security**, make a de facto widow eligible for a loan in her own right, and enable certain de facto widows to be granted relief in respect of commitments on their property under the same conditions as those applicable to de jure widows.

* There are enormous psychological and economic factors which weigh heavily on those who find themselves pregnant outside the **security** of marriage.

* Has the Australian Government raised the matter in the United Nations General Assembly or the **Security**, Council; if not will it do so.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I draw to the attention of the House a quite serious situation that has arisen in New South Wales because of the obsolescence of the Child Care Act of 1972.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has recently, for the purposes of payment of recurrent subsidies, approved graduates from some child care certificate courses as equivalent to a nurse under section 11(5) of Part III of the Child Care Act of 1972.

* The Department of Social **Security** says that the situation is under review.

* At the end of this year five long-day care centres in Wollongong will be eligible for the subsidy but, as the Act now stands, in order to pick up the subsidy from the Department of Social **Security**, they will have to employ graduates from outside the area, that is from North Sydney, Penrith and Newcastle colleges.

* I seek the immediate intervention of the Department of Social **Security** to rectify this gross injustice.

* The provisions in this Bill are sufficient to leave no doubt in the minds of the people that the Labor Government intends to ensure, by way of legislation or other means at its disposal, that the entire population of Australia - not just some small sections of it - will be able to look to the future with a feeling of **security**.

* What a great relief it must be to so many of those people to be able to see ahead of them a clear future of **security** and happiness rather than one of utter despair.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said during his second reading speech, this Bill will not only remove a number of the seriously unjust and penalising anomalies in the existing Act but will also provide generous increases in all pensions and in sickness and unemployment benefits.

* The Minister for Social **Security** and the Cabinet are to be congratulated for the way in which they have acted to give the pensioners a fair deal.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is to be congratulated upon introducing the Bill so early in the session.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: 
am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: 
Has the Department of Social **Security** reviewed the estimates for 1975-76 presented on 26 September 1975 by the interdepartmental working party on the financial aspects of the National Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme and tabled on 28 October 1 975  (Hansard,  24 February 1 977, page 509).

* The Opposition did not oppose the Bill in either House of the Parliament when it was introduced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the scheme was initiated.

* She said that she belonged to the Federal social **security** service.

* She repeated that she was an assistant social worker and that she was working in his State electorate and in my Federal electorate doing normal social **security** work.

* How much of this money has been applied to any social **security** activities, to Australian Assistance Plan activities, or to any other purpose not in any way connected with Darwin relief?

* I point out to the honourable gentleman that the Budget Speech contains a reference to increased staff allocations for the Department of Social **Security** which are designed, in part, to improve provision of services and also to tighten existing procedures.

* On the basis of advice and after consultation between the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of Finance and the Public Service Board- given the tightened procedures that are being adopted- an adjustment which produces the difference to which the honourable gentleman refers was felt to be both proper and sound.

* The honourable gentleman should well know that the only reasons that justify this action and which have caused the Government to examine this path are reasons of **security** and the advice received in the strongest terms in relation to **security** which involves not only inconvenience to other passengers on a commercial international air flight but also, on the basis of the advice given to us, very considerable additional risk to passengers on commercial airlines.

* Mr Speaker, we all know that **security** requirements have intensified.

* The very arrangements which you, in concert with the  President,  have had to institute for the **security** of this Parliament indicate a changed attitude and a changed requirement in relation to these matters.

* For example, at Bahrain passengers are not let off the aircraft if I happen to be on it because there are not adequate **security** arrangements to check them again on boarding and that causes inconvenience and concern.

* In those circumstances, the reason for pursuing this path is one of **security**.

* Is it a fact that no **security** examination was made prior to this officer's appointment?

* We have heard the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  running away from a challenge to have the proposals of his Committee tested by a select committee of this House.

* On the vital question of freedom of choice, which relates primarily to the freedom to establish relationships in this policy area - relationships between patient and doctor, patient and the hospital - the Minister for Social **Security**, though he mouths the phrase freedom of choice', nevertheless has in his mind a totally different concept from that held by the majority of his listeners.

* A leading Liberal, a founder of the Liberal Party of Australia, said some years ago of the Australian socialist: 
The whitewash paper that was introduced today was debated by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* Let us look at what it has to say on some other important matters, matters which the Minister for Social **Security** is unwilling to enable a select committee of this House to test by calling objective evidence.

* Honourable members will be aware that the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Act of 1954, as amended in 1976, provides for the Department of Social **Security** to fund on a federal level, on a two to one basis, the capital costs of new nursing homes after applications are forwarded from religious, charitable or local government bodies.

* They are not necessarily the projects that receive, firstly, approval in principal from the Federal-State coordinating committee on the provision of nursing homes for the aged and, secondly, after approval is granted, funds from the Federal Department of Social **Security**.

* I am informed by the  Deputy  Director-General of Social **Security** that currently in the Wollongong-Shellharbour area, 328 beds are available.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The guidelines governing the exercise of the Departmental discretions in the administration of the laws governing the functions of the Department of Social **Security** are presently being reviewed to enable the Department to comply with the provisions of the Freedom of Information legislation when it becomes law.

* That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the motion to refer the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill to a legislation committee being determined on a majority vote.

* In this legislation there is no protection against the irresponsible or improper use of **security** facilities.

* I appeal to those members in this House to see the **security** operations of this country as being an important and a serious function of government which should be above party politics and which should be seen to operate as necessary within the national interest.

* The only way in which that can occur is for the Bill, which establishes the limits within which the **security** organisations in this country operate, to be drafted to ensure that it meets the objections of those people who believe that **security** can be misused and to ensure that the clauses do what I think the Government would suggest they should do.

* There are too many cases of abuses of **security** on the record.

* The Government's decision to refuse to refer the matter to a legislation committee is a decision to politicise the debate on this Bill to the exclusion of the benefit of the **security** organisation, the people of Australia and this Parliament.

* He says that the Government's policy rests on the belief that Australia is well placed to make a serious contribution to the preservation of peace and the promotion of the welfare of our neighbours while at the same time and by the same path promoting her own interests and **security**.

* In New York in October last year I had a useful talk with the leader of the Chinese Mission to the United Nations who was then serving his term as  Chairman  of the **Security** Council.

* China subsequently supported us in our election to the **Security** Council.

* The maintenance of our alliance with the United States under ANZUS remains most important for our **security**.

* No **security** classification was accorded the team's report.

* It happened because, as we have heard, the Country Party and its Liberal Party associates in this respect are devoted to the principle that they have been propounding in this House for the last three or four days - that policy should be made outside this House, whether it be by Dalgetys or by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* Further, is the Australian Government prepared to urge members of the IGGI to withhold assistance to Indonesia until the United Nations **Security** Council resolutions have been implemented?

* First of all, let me take the commencement date of the increased social **security** payments- 13 May 1976.

* The time has come for us to take an overall look at the whole social **security** system to make absolutely certain, in the first instance, that the payments that we are considering now are adequate for 1976.

* So the social **security** base is being eroded by not tackling such questions as dependants' allowances, by not updating the system, by not making sure that there are automatic adjustments for price rises.

* Over half a million people are involved in what is a unique social **security** system.

* It is 
Australia's most experienced social **security** system.

* I suppose in a way it is Australia's most generalised social **security** system, including as it does, benefits across the board from students' allowances to support for soldiers' children through housing and all the rest of it.

* There is a lot to be learned in the social **security** area from the simple application of many of the principles we have evolved over the years in repatriation.

* Tonight I am suggesting that the House give serious thought to taking the lessons out of the repatriation system, taking some of the standards we have adopted in the repatriation system and applying them as rapidly as possible to the rest of the community through the social **security** system.

* It is Australia's most experienced social **security** service.

* We are voting against the removal of funeral benefits, and we object to the deferment of the beginning of the social **security** payments because, as I said earlier, and as my colleagues on this side of the House have reiterated, it is one of the characteristics of this Government that the people who are the least able to pay are the ones it will make pay.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
by leave- The Australian Government deeply regrets that events in the Indian sub-continent have led to full-scale warfare between India and Pakistan.

* In New York, efforts by the **Security** Council to reach an agreed conclusion have so far been unsuccessful.

* The continuance of humanitarian and economic aid to both countries will be maintained, although for the time being it will have to be subject to certain practical restrictions, including those imposed by **security**.

* Australia is particularly disappointed that there has so" far been no fruitful outcome from the debates in the **Security** Council.

* With both parties engaged in full-scale hostilities, and with the present alignment of forces and opinion in the **Security** Council, there are formidable obstacles in the way of bringing this conflict, to an end.

* This is quite interesting because until a certain document came from the Department of Social **Security** to the private health funds it was completely impossible for the health funds to know what would be the rules of the game after 1 July.

* I refer to a circular entitled: 
Australian Government Department of Social **Security** Conduct of Private Health Insurance after 30 June 1975.

* The honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  very correctly and, I believe, cleverly, drew this matter to the attention of the public today when he contrasted the contradiction between the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)-  that is the Minister at the moment- and the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns).

* In a number of replies the Minister for Social **Security** has given to various people both in writing and in public statements he has pointed out a whole range of insurable items which the health funds could have after 1 July and which would be tax deductible.

* Yet the present Treasurer, who is soon to be the Minister for Social **Security**, gave another answer to a question which I placed on notice on 2 1 May.

* The Treasurer's answer was as follows: 
What a farce; what a misleading of the public; what a sham when we have the Minister for Social **Security** saying one thing and the Treasurer saying a completely different thing.

* The Leader of the Opposition stated very firmly that he would not agree to scrutiny of Australian **security** services by this Parliament.

* It is the job of the Executive, not the legislature, to oversee the operations of the **security** services of our nation and the activities of any other **security** services which may or may not be operating in Australia.

* The debate has been used as a left wing device to denigrate Australian **security** services such as the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and as pan of the battle for leadership in the Australian Labor Party.

* It has done nothing for the **security** of this nation.

* -As the honourable member for Dawson says, nor has it done anything for the **security** of the Leader of the Opposition himself.

* It states: 
The KGB, or Committee for State **Security**, is the principal instrument through which the Soviet Union is ruled and Soviet foreign policy is executed.

* They were charged with engaging in operations against the **security** of that country.

* It is quite cynical for the Opposition to devote all its time in this debate to denigration of the **security** services of our major allies.

* Opposition speakers said nothing about the **security** services of other countries which are certainly working actively against Australia's **security**.

* Obviously the Opposition has great hang-ups not only about overseas **security** services in Australia but also perhaps about our own **security** services.

* It cut off the flow of any information from overseas to our own **security** services for some time.

* If we have parliamentary committees inquiring into the operation of overseas **security** services, of course our flow of information from other countries, which is vitally important to the **security** of Australia, will be cut off.

* There is certainly a great deal of criticism of the congressional oversight of some of the operations of **security** services.

* I believe it is a disgraceful ploy to focus the Opposition's paranoic views on **security** against the United States and against the Central Intelligence Agency, and I very much regret that I have had to take part in such a cynical and ridiculous debate.

* But the aspect of this matter that may be personally damaging to a man is that previous instances of refusals of permits to enter the Territory, such as in the cases of Gluckman and Worsley, have been stared straight out to be **security** questions.

* So there is now an implication that any man who is refused permission to enter has some grave **security** objection against him.

* If there had been any **security** objection to him, presumably his entry permit would not have been renewed at all.

* There cannot be any **security** objection to the man for him to be reappointed.

* There is no explanation as to why, in view of the positions he had held in the United States, such a long time was taken in checking up on him - if it was a **security** check that was being taken.

* Also, the airline will be required to satisfy the Treasurer that adequate and proper **security** is given to the Commonwealth over the two aircraft.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 August 1 977: 
Social **Security**.

* Irrespective of what the other 117 members may say, Australia depends on those 7 members to a great extent for its **security**, its defence, its wealth, its productivity and its decentralisation.

* In the period following the proroguing of" the 30th Parliament and the election we saw the threat to our **security** through northern Australia in the form of Taiwanese boats which put refugees into Darwin and areas on the north coast.

* Those roads are important not only for military reasons but also for the other aspects of **security** and defence that I mentioned earlier.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has said that the Income **Security** Review Committee is examining the whole range of benefits with a view not only of rationalising the odds and ends that now exist, but also of producing a new, better and more meaningful scheme of income assistance for those who are in need.

* It talks constantly about the alleged high cost of the Australian Government's scheme sponsored by my colleague  Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Social **Security**.

* It refuses constantly to tell the people some of the things which they will get from the 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
All Social **Security** programs, including payments under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act and special benefits for people under maintenance guarantees and for refugees, cover migrants insofar as migrants are members of the Australian community.

* Since 1974 information material on social **security** programs and services has been printed in ethnic languages.

* Details on expenditure by the Department of Social **Security** from 1974 to 1977 for programs and policies specifically concerning migrants administered by the Migrant Services Branch were as follows: 
-That is so.

* The small investor can have no **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was the great favourite to become the new Treasurer until he got up in the Caucus and honestly said: 'We are supervising the destruction of the Australian economy'.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 27 April 1977: 
What expenditures have been made under major programs administered by the Department of Social **Security** in the electoral division of Calare in 1974-75 and 1975-76.

* Its role is to plan, co-ordinate and initiate protective **security** arrangements for people holding high office visiting or present in Australia, and to co-ordinate counter-terrorist measures.

* The Government has considered and accepted the basic conclusions of the report by  Mr Justice  Hope on intelligence and **security** and is acting to ensure his conclusions are put into effect.

* In addition, my Government has undertaken a further review of the totality of **security** arrangements against acts of terrorism.

* Immediately after the tragedy occurred, the Premier of New South Wales and I agreed that a complete review of **security** arrangements for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting was required, and **security** was further tightened.

* The New South Wales Premier,  Mr Wran,  put the **security** and safety of the people of New South Wales and of visiting delegations as his first priority after the bomb explosion in Sydney.

* I also inform the House that  Sir Robert  Mark, who has recently retired as Commissioner of London Metropolitan Police- New Scotland Yard- has, at the Government's request, made himself immediately available to advise on the organisation of police resources in the Commonwealth area and measures for protective **security** and counter-terrorism.

* In addition to these immediate measures, the Government believes it of the utmost importance that a review be undertaken of the whole area of protective **security** in Australia by a person who has an appreciation of intelligence and **security** operations, and a concern for the liberties of individual men and women of Australia.

* His  reports on intelligence and **security** were certainly very well presented and have enabled the Government to adopt far-reaching reforms in ways that not only protect the civil liberties of all Australians but also at the same time make sure that we have much more effective **security** mechanisms available to us.

* I have received from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  a thoughtful and constructive letter which manifests a clear concern both for **security** and civil liberties.

* This would include the particular case of relationships between Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and the Special Branches of State police forces on which I have already been in communication with the Premiers.

* Arrangements to achieve co-operation of assessments of **security** risks and the communication of these assessments to relevant agencies and authorities.

* The relationship between the Defence Force and civilian authorities in the matter of civilian **security**.

* **Security** and protective arrangements in force in all Commonwealth departments and authorities, and the capacity of departments and authorities to provide support to the general protective **security** effort in various situations.

* The overall balancing of the interests of **security** and the rights of private citizens.

* I should add also that Ministers and their departments have been asked to ensure that their protective **security** arrangements are fully adequate and that within their areas of responsibility they do everything they can to achieve even better arrangements than they have had in the past.

* I recall in this context the statement in the Rockefeller reports on the Central Intelligence Agency quoted by  Mr Justice  Hope in his Fourth Report on Intelligence and **Security**: 
Protective **Security** and Counter-terrorism- Ministerial Statement, 23 February 1978.

* There are two main points to what he is asserting: Firstly, that a representative of IBM Australia Ltd accompanied officers of the Department of Social **Security** in Canada when I was Minister for Social **Security**.

* Secondly, that tenders were not called for computer facilities to service the introduction of Medibank while I was Minister for Social **Security**.

* As I pointed out yesterday after Question Time in this House, the accompaniment of officers of the Department of Social **Security** by a representative of IBM occurred without my knowledge.

* I put on the record again that I said: 
Now, what happened was that the Department of Social **Security** had not realised that the incoming Labor Government had higher standards and applied tougher requirements in these matters than the previous Government.

* As far as I am concerned, every document, every paper and every matter relating to the issue of the certificate of inexpendiency for the acquisition of computer equipment in 1973 when I was Minister for Social **Security** can be released.

* 102 - Social **Security** (Minimum Standards), 1952 prescribe minimum standards of benefit for 9 branches of social **security**, namely, medical care, sickness, unemployment, old age, employment injury, family, maternity, invalidity and survivors' benefits.

* Surely the people of Australia were entitled to expect with statements in the policy speech, with echoes of the Prime Minister's own statement, with statements from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  that pensioners would continue, at least in the immediate future, to be given pension rises twice yearly.

* In fact the Minister for Social **Security** denied in the Senate last September that it was related to inflation.

* I conclude by stating that the Government is discriminating against most of the people by ignoring their needs, their welfare, their protection, their health and their **security** and imposing at the same time a taxation burden from which the country gets scant and reluctant government benefit.

* I ask him a simple question in 2 parts: Firstly, did he say it, or anything like it, and, secondly, because of the silence of his usually non-silent colleague the Minister for Social **Security**, am I right in assuming that the Minister for Social **Security** agrees with the Minister for Health?

* There is no need for that kind of lunacy in **security** measures in this country.

* There are some documents which are subject to certain **security** classifications and this means that they are shown to persons on the basis of their need to know of them.

* Those documents are shown only to persons who need to know them and on my own staff they are shown to persons who have the top **security** clearance.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  made a very political second reading speech.

* The Minister for Social **Security** mentioned in his second reading speech that the Government would be prepared to respond appropriately if such proved to be the case, the point being that the inflation rate may remain as high and, therefore, 1.50 would be insufficient.

* But I think it would be a mistake and an oversight if we did not recognise also  -  I hope the Minister for Social **Security** does recognise - that in many ways a greater percentage of poverty exists in rural areas than in metropolitan areas.

* I believe that this is a most unjust feature of our social **security** system.

* When the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  introduced the Australian Assistance Plan during the term of office of the Labor Government, as shadow Minister for Social **Security** I had something to say about it.

* I would like to say that during the election campaign, not as the shadow Minister for Social **Security** but as the Minister for Social **Security** or the caretaker Minister for Social **Security**, I was authorised by the Cabinet itself to issue on 22 November a statement which committed this Government if elected to retain and maintain the Australian Assistance Plan.

* That was said in these unequivocal terms: 
I second the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  that this House censures the Government for jeopardising Australia's **security** and injuring our reputation as a reliable ally.

* When the issue is national **security** it is a supreme issue.

* The Prime Minister even wrote a threatening letter to the Leader of the Opposition for exposing this matter and asking questions relating to **security**.

* The actions of the Government in the area of national **security** are engendering great concern and fear in the minds of many Australians.

* The Prime Minister is deserving of the strongest censure for his inexcusable action in divulging this matter knowing it to be subject to a need for **security**.

* Any man who is prepared to play with the nation's **security** to meet his own domestic party political problems must be strongly criticised.

* I was advised shortly before question time that there has been a continuing surveillance by **security** people of the son of transport arrangements that ought to be made for visitors and in particular for VIPs visiting Australia.

* To embellish those particular examinations from time to time of what **security** requirements are necessary for visitors to this country and for other people in this country, as was done in the report on the front page of the  Sun  this morning, is somewhat imaginative.

* The Minister then had the hide to talk about **security**, but this Government would not give us the benefit of the doubt when we were in office when we were advised about the **security** involved in using a 707 aircraft.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: 
What are the rules covering the portability of Australian social **security** pensions.

* Does the Minister for Defence have any information concerning the attitude of the United States of America to his policy of providing information to the parliamentary Opposition on **security** matters, in particular, the sensitive issue of United States' bases in Australia?

* The first item with which I would like to deal concerns the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I know that no specific explanation is ever given as to how money is spent by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and I do not dispute the need for the existence of some form of **security** intelligence organisation, but I do dispute the argument that the Parliament and, through the Parliament, the people of Australia should not be given some indication of how large the Organisation is.

* The provision of **security** for policy holders and the savings which they generate for investment in this developing country of ours are just two of the important reasons for that great industry.

* The United Kingdom Government could not have made these decisions if the Australian Government of the day had said: 'We are not concerned with **security** in the region.

* -I rise to take part in this Committee discussion of the estimates of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I should say that under our social **security** system we do make special provisions for families where there are children with a single parent.

* I draw to the attention of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who in this House represents the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the need for the Government to look at the total family allowance program and the need as circumstances permit to ask the question whether when we increase those benefits to maintain their real value we should not at the same time make a substantial increase in real value of the payments made in respect of the first child particularly while that first child is in the pre-school age group.

* I urge the Government, in its assessment and reexamination of the social welfare system, to get a co-ordinated plan to ensure that retention rates for people on low incomes are increased, that the tax system and the social **security** system are harmonised, that one department is used to administer the test to be applied, and that the heavy burden placed on low income earners is removed.

* In the White Paper - if I may call it so - issued by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  on 30th August 1971, which is entitled 'The Future **Security** of Permanent Overseas Officers of the Public Service', we have set out the options - they are 3 in number - open to the permanent overseas officers as they are called, or 'Poos' for short, if I may use a local term.

* They are in fact those who are eligible under the employment **security** scheme to take advantage of these options.

* with reasonable peace of mind and reasonable **security** in the future.

* This Budget contains many worthwhile benefits and initiatives, introduced in spite of the reduced deficit and in spite of the knockers who predicted cuts in such things as education, the removal of the $16 per day private hospital bed subsidy, a reduction in social **security** benefits and so on.

* The Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  is to be congratulated for at last achieving the go ahead for a maximum **security** quarantine station on the Cocos Islands.

* The new nursing home benefits to operate from 1 October offer greater **security** for people who require to enter a nursing home or place their relations in one.

* I shall talk further on the estimates for health, welfare and social **security**, but I make the point that much still has to be done by this Government for country people.

* This authority in the real world is delegated to junior officers in the Department of Social **Security** as advised by junior officers in the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* Perhaps he could go to a sympathetic officer of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security**.

* I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a table from the Department of Social **Security** showing some of the problems of that electorate.

* Taken from Department of Social **Security**- Recipients of pensions, benefits and family allowances in postcode districts and electoral divisions, NSW-ACT; June 1978.

* Special **security** arrangements apply to prevent unauthorised access to the PABX at Parliament House.

* Earlier this evening I was in my office listening to this debate and heard the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  making a statement about the **security** checks for ministerial staff.

* In relation to **security**, as far as my staff is concerned there have been no requests for **security** checks.

* My personal private secretary was employed in the Taxation Office for 25 years, so I have no doubt that the **security** service has run over him from time to time.

* There is also another young man on my personal staff who has not had a **security** check.

* Let us look at this question of **security**.

* This situation has allowed the development of what Pat O'Malley has called a 'sub-proletariat' of socially and economically disadvantaged migrant workers who perform dirty work, that is, work which is lowly paid, has poor job **security** and involves poor conditions.

* Is there a future for many of the innovative programs started during Labor's term of office- programs under the Department of Social **Security** such as welfare rights, the Outreach program, telephone interpreter services and so on?

* How will migrants who need such assistance to obtain benefits and allowances to which they are entitled fare now that the Department of Social **Security** is no longer responsible for providing these migrant services?

* In other words, despite the increasing clamour from various migrant welfare organisations for more funds, for reasons best known to itself the Government has inhibited the Department of Social **Security**- now it is the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs- from distributing the funds theoretically available for grantsinaid.

* For the information of the House I wish to relate an incident which commenced on 9 February this year when I claimed in Brisbane that a group of Aborigines had formed a cooperative to steal pension and social **security** cheques from letterboxes.

* That comment was reported in the Brisbane  Courier-Mail  of 9 February, and the article goes on to state: 

 Mr Cameron warned businessmen that the Social **Security** Department would not take responsibility if they cashed stolen cheques.

* Two days later when the Parliament was still in recess I, as a responsible member of this House, wrote to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  suggesting that there was a need to reexamine the system of issuing cheques.

* I wrote in these terms: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* They include a reduction in the size of the Public Service; cuts in government expenditure, budgetary savings; we have to reduce social **security**; we have to tighten our belts.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Developments in the system of national superannuation in New Zealand have been studied with interest within the Department of Social **Security**.

* Articles on the subject, prepared by officers of the Department, appeared in the Autumn 1975 and Autumn 1977 editions of the Departmental publication Socio/  **Security** Quarterly.

* We, of course, were treated to a political run-out by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on this vital matter.

* I received a letter from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  dated 7 June.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) Yes.

* The British Depanment of Health and Social **Security** recently decided that the payment of its National Insurance pensions in Australia should be made by order direct from its United Kingdom Central Office in the same way as its pensions are paid in all other countries.

* No cases of hardship have come to notice resulting from changes in arrangements between the UK Government and the Depanment of Social **Security**.

* It is emphasised that these changed arrangements were the result of initiatives by the United Kingdom authorities and were not sought by the Australian Depanment of Social **Security**.

* In recent weeks, honourable members have been treated to the clear revelation that the Minister for Defence has lost control of .his Department, the biggest spending unit of the entire Government and one of critical importance to our international relations and our national **security**.

* These members of the Commonwealth Police are situated in Bendigo to look after **security** at the Bendigo ordnance factory , which these days might not need such high level **security**, and also at the Longlea magazine in Bendigo, which does need a deal of high **security**.

* They have been advised by the Department that they should expect to be transferred to Melbourne to work as **security** guards at the airport and other areas in the western sector of Melbourne.

* These factors alone- no power of arrest and no arms for protectionwould detract from the benefit of having any **security** service operating at these places.

* We can only hope that the Minister will take urgent steps to protect the 9 families who are concerned in Bendigo and also will take necessary action to ensure proper protection and **security** for the 2 undertakings concerned.

* Arrangements for the borrowings are then subject to the Treasurer's approval and adequate mortgage **security** being provided to the Commonwealth by Qantas.

* I point out that on 13 December 1978 the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  issued a statement which made it abundantly clear that the weight of **security** advice left the Government with no alternative.

* I see no reason to repeat at length the information that was given but it is fair to report to the House that those problems of **security** and the uses to which the honourable member for Cook referred and to which the 707s will be put were major considerations.

* There is a crucial need for **security**.

* The scheme of this legislation does not mean anything more than that the **security** organisation will obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to **security**.

* Will the Minister now institute feasibility studies of the application of the H-coal process, utilising the vast brown coal resources in the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, in the production of oil from coal on the grounds of national **security**, environmental protection and decentralisation?

* -The honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  started his speech by saying he had music for the ears of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in that he intended not only to accept these Bills but also to commend the Government upon them.

* It is a great pleasure to be able to do this if only because on so many occasions he and I seem to follow each other in social **security** debates under different sets of circumstances.

* In previous debates I have had occasion to comment on the peculiar emphasis which crops up in so many areas of our social **security** legislation based on old age consideration.

* The description and background of that scheme may be found on page 58 of the latest annual report of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I again refer to the annual report of the Department of Social **Security** for a description of this scheme which I think will again make the argument I am trying to present almost self-evident.

* As the Minister for Social **Security** indicated in his second reading speech, although he did not require the Bill to achieve this, the maximum amounts of subsidy have also been substantially increased.

* Instead of that, this Government has taken steps to give local councils some **security** and predictability about where they are going with their funding.

* It is an important piece of legislation dealing with the civil liberties, the protection and the **security** of the citizens of this country.

* The Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation is already in existence.

* Honourable members on this side of the House, whilst they can see lots of objections to the Bill as it stands, still accept the proposition that there should be an Australian **Security** and Intelligence Organisation.

* What honourable members in the Opposition do worry about is how it will protect Australia from people who are dangerous to its **security**.

* As soon as one starts talking about **security** one gets into a difficult position because what one person, a group of people or even the Government may consider to be a threat to the **security** of the country need not necessarily be accepted by others as a threat to the **security** of this country.

* One of the things that worries me most about this **security** intelligence organisation is that I have significant doubts about the intelligence of some of its members.

* I do not consider that people generally connected with **security** intelligence organisations are politically literate.

* It is one of my greatest worries that the sort of people who are put in charge of **security** intelligence organisations, or who gravitate into prominent positions within those organisations, have a very narrow view as to what kind of political actions ought to be allowed in a country and what kind of actions are well within the limits with which a democracy can easily deal.

* If one accepts the proposition that there are totalitarian countries in the world which are trying to undermine the **security** of this country, the most important aspect of the difference between them and us is that totalitarianism.

* If we cannot avoid the totalitarianism which they embrace and use continuously there is not much point in defending our kind of **security**.

* We would like the committee to consider the definitions or the redefinitions of the concept of **security** and the element of subversion in order to narrow their scope and to limit the possibility of their misapplication.

* In otherwords, the proposed committee should define the aim of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and state exactly what it should be looking for, what exactly is subversion.

* It does not pose a threat to the **security** of this country.

* The important aspect of the whole aim of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation legislation is that it should make clear that the aim of that Organisation is not to protect a particular government, a particular political party or even the two, three or four main political parties in the mainstream of Australian life.

* That is not the aim or should not be the aim of an Australian **security** intelligence organisation.

* If we define **security** and subversion in a sense so broad that it encompasses anything which would involve a change in the way of life in this country, it is much too broad.

* What reason could we possibly have then for opposing the activities of its type of **security** intelligence organisation, the KGB.

* They consider that anybody who says anything against the Soviet state inside the Soviet Union is spreading malicious propaganda against the state and is a threat to their **security**.

* Therefore it is important that we define very clearly the questions of **security** and subversion.

* For our **security** organisation to act effectively we have to have bipartisan support in the broadest sense as far as political life in this country is concerned.

* outline job **security**, training, retraining and relocation programs; 
In the short time available to me I want to make about eight points in relation to this.

* If cars are not relatively cheap and if we continue to require high levels of protection the industry will continue to stagnate and there will be no **security** of employment for those working in this industry.

* The fifth point is that, of course, we must have better job **security**, better training schemes, retraining and relocation programs.

* The document states: 
Trade adjustment assistance for workers is a Federal program administered by the US Department of Labor and co-operating State employment **security** agencies under provisions of the Trade Act of 1974.

* I noted the emphasis he put on scepticism and, particularly, what he described as the scepticism of the **security** cult.

* From listening to his speech, as he described what he saw in our **security** organisation in Australia, one could be forgiven for believing that one had been listening to the total sceptic.

* He described honourable members who defend **security** organisations and who have a concern for the world in which we live as having some paranoic fear.

* He may also have detected some paranoia on his side of the House in the feelings that Opposition members have about persecution and what information **security** organisations might be keeping about them.

* If he was so convinced in his scepticism about the adequacy of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation one would have thought that he would have been able to convince his colleagues to take one certain line, that is, the line he took which suggested that ASIO is an organisation unworthy of worry and concern.

* The honourable member for Bonython  (Dr Blewett)  and the honourable member for Lalor both attempted to offer for the Labor Party their intellectual justification for attacking this legislation and the purposes behind having a **security** organisation.

* The honourable member for Bonython was critical in his address because he saw **security** organisations as being necessary in maintaining a police state, an autocracy.

* He did not think that a strong democracy needed a **security** organisation.

* In looking at why we need **security** organisations I think it is important to bear these sorts of matters in mind.

* She said: 
to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to **security**; 
b ) for purposes relevant to **security** and not otherwise, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner, as are appropriate to those purposes; and 
to advise Ministers and authorities of the Commonwealth in respect of matters relating to **security**, in so far as those matters are relevant to their functions and responsibility.

* It is not a function of the Organization to carry out or enforce measures for **security** within an authority of the Commonwealth.

* These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** constituted by  Mr Justice  Hope, after a most thorough investigation.

* One can see that coming out from the nature of the exceptions provided for in clause 8(2) which in paragraph (a) says that the Minister- that is, the Attorney-General- is not empowered to override the opinion of the Director-General, firstly, on the question whether the collection of intelligence by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation concerning a particular individual would or would not be justified by reason of its relevance to **security**.

* Paragraph (b) states that the AttorneyGeneral cannot override the opinion of the Director-General on the question whether a communication of intelligence concerning a particular individual would be for a purpose relevant to **security**.

* That advice must be the professional advice of the Director-General in fulfilment of his functions under the legislation relating to the national **security** of the nation.

* It states: 
Because of the escalation of **security** arrangements in the HIFAR area many of your staff may wonder why the indecent haste, when, for many years, there was virtually no local **security**.

* The institution of better **security** arrangements had been proposed for some time prior to their recent implementation.

* I don't think its likely we'll sec a relaxation  in **security** as time goes on, but it may change in method.

* To a large degree this rests with the Director of Commission **Security**.

* If, in fact, there had been such a serious threat to the well-being of 1,200 employees at that research establishment and, indeed, to many of my constituents who live in close proximity to that establishment, this Parliament should be entitled to know something about the extent of **security** arrangements being instituted.

* If that has occurred there is something very seriously wrong with the **security** in the atomic reactor.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Social **Security**: Expenditures in Werriwa Division (Question No.

* The balance is to remain at call and be used by the Bank as **security** for its future borrowing operations.

* Another, and less controversial, objection raised by the States was to the effect of section 78 of the Act on the **security** of State interests in land acquired by Aboriginal corporations from State governments and the need for States to retain ownership and control of such lands transferred to an Aboriginal land trust and subsequently leased to an Aboriginal corporation.

* The Bill also provides for a widening of the definition of holding' in the War Service Homes Act, which wilt enable certain interests in land, not presently provided for in the Act, to be accepted as a **security** for a war service homes loan.

* These interests in land represent new tenures or tenures which until recently were not in common use and which are now generally accepted as marketable interests in land and which would provide a satisfactory **security** for a war service homes loan.

* The Act defines a 'purchaser' to mean a person who has purchased from the Director a dwelling-house and land; and a 'borrower' as a person who has received an advance, or executed a mortgage or other **security** to the Director.

* Whilst I pay due regard to the efforts of the Labor administration in the field of social **security**, I am disappointed to note that because of increases in costs many people are forced to eat into their rather meagre savings in order to maintain their existence in nursing homes, and I charge honourable members opposite with having the complete responsibility to do something for these people.

* Now, because of increasing costs and the fact that the Government has not lived up to its preelection promise to make social **security** benefits equal to 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings, these people find it impossible to make ends meet.

* I appeal to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to increase, in a meaningful way, the Commonwealth Government's contribution on behalf of people who live in nursing homes and people who require intensive nursing care so that these people will have some **security** and will be able to live out their remaining days in some dignity.

* At least the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  fought for her Department.

* God only help us if the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs is ever sent in as Minister for Social **Security**.

* All the people caught under the umbrella of social **security** in this country will receive the very same treatment that he has dealt out in succession to the Aboriginal people and now to the unemployed.

* Properly applied, it can bring greater benefits and greater material **security** to all wage earners and contribute to the solution of our long-term economic problems.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
Home at Dulwich Hill and office furniture, floor coverings and office supplies for a St George district branch of the Good Neighbour Council) were included in submissions proposed by the South West Sydney Regional Social Development Council for funding under the Australian Assistance Plan.

* All Regional Councils are required to sign an agreement which includes the clauses: 'to apply the (Australian Government) funds for the purposes for which and in accordance with the terms upon which they are respectively provided; ' and 'in the event that any funds are not required for application or cannot be applied as aforesaid, to refund to your Department (of Social **Security**) such funds as are not required or capable of application'.

* I commend to the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  the functions of the New York Stock Exchange to establish a set of norms both as to price and volume fluctuations in each listed **security** and to suspend trading in any shares for 24 hours at any time that either of those norms are exceeded or until explanatory information is received and published.

* They would have been disabused for all time if they ever believed that there was any genuine concern resting in the ranks of the Government towards the position of pensioners and people in this community who are dependent on social **security** benefits.

* The Bill before this Parliament at present represents the most extensive and sustained assault upon social **security** benefits that this country has seen.

* When the Whitlam Labor Government was in office and I was Minister for Social **Security** we generously increased the rate of government subsidy for aged persons ' housing constructed by voluntary agencies from $2 for every dollar raised by the agencies to $4 for every dollar.

* Echoing him faithfully, his Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in December of last year said: 
Clause 59 will authorise the Minister for Finance to waive the recovery of amounts of moneys which are legally recoverable but which, for good reason, ought not to be recovered, under similar procedures as those proposed for act of grace payments.

* Under the Act as it stands at present there is no provision to exempt any part of the public accounts from such examination and audit but the Government is satisfied that provision should be made to allow the exemption of certain parts of the accounts of the **security** and intelligence organisations relating to highly confidential expenditure so that there could be no risk that the operations of the organisations might be prejudiced in any way.

* The Australian **security** service is not concerned with breaches of State law, and if the gentleman to whom the honourable member spoke was an officer of the true Australian **security** service he was acting beyond the powers of his statute.

* The statute of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation requires it to be concerned with the **security** of Australia, and the **security** of Australia is defined in the statute as referring to espionage, sabotage and subversion.

* There are also cases where the source of the information presents in itself  a  difficulty as one perhaps would be revealing a source that one would never be able to use again in the **security** service if one gave evidence on it, at any rate in public.

* From time to time one reads that trading on a particular **security** has been stopped.

* At the moment the power to say whether the trading on a **security** should stop or should not stop is given to a group of often anonymous people who are not elected by the public in the same way as we are elected as politicians.

* The honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  in his capacity as the shadow Minister for Social **Security**, has listed the following matter of public importance for debate: 
The actions of the Minister for Social **Security** in attempting to cover-up secret negotiations aimed at amending the Government's proposed health scheme.

* That the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  was not directly a party to any such discussions, secret or otherwise, is just a bonus for those who see the raising of this matter as a desperate clutching at straws.

* Members of the Opposition seemed to become terribly upset, irate and indignant when a document containing the policy recommendations of the Liberal Party's Committee on Social **Security**, Health and Welfare, which they regard as confidential, was produced in the House today.

* Their leaders would, of course, be put under surveillance by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* There is evidence to show that ASIO has in the past provided selected people with **security** intelligence material for publication.

* It crosses the boundary between provision of information, which is proper, and the taking of a  measure for **security** ', which is not proper.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  uses expressions such as: 
 The honourable gentleman says that assumes there will be no increase in the pension between now and then.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said it.

* Are we not to believe the Treasurer and the Minister for Social **Security**?

* Did the Minister for Social **Security** not say that the next increase will be in the autumn of 1975?

* The Minister for Social **Security** is very fond of saying that the age pension has risen at a greater rate than the cost of living index and of saying that he can put figures down to prove it.

* Social **security** is a priority issue with the Opposition.

* I remind the Minister for Social **Security** that on 1 May this year, speaking about child care programs, he said: 
The Labor Government has also broken another promise it made in the social welfare area, that is, the promise to remove the means test for persons 70 years of age and over.

* I have in front of me a telegram, a copy of which was no doubt sent to the Minister for Social **Security**, from the South Australian Public Service Association, the South Australian Government Superannuation Federation, the South Australian Government Superannuated Employees Association and the South Australian Institute of Teachers - most of which bodies I should have thought would have been Labor supporters and would have come out in support of the Labor Government during the last election campaign - expressing disenchantment with the Labor Government for welching on yet another promise that it made to them concerning fixed incomes.

* I also made the point in response to the Minister for Social **Security** - some of the interjectors in the Labor Party did not seem to understand the point that I was getting at when I challenged the Minister's figures- that now the pensions would be 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* In short, the trade union movement and our opponents in this House put the drive for ever increasing money incomes ahead of employment and job **security**.

* What we have done is to drain off a sizable portion of the surplus liquidity into a new **security** which is now very attractive to hold rather than prematurely cash in.

* Because of the deliberately attractive terms it offered, it not only drew in $759m of subscriptions- virtually all of it from non-bank sources- but it established the new 'household' **security** in a way which will stand this Government and this country in good stead in future.

* Have any Australian workers in defence establishments been prosecuted for breaches of **security** in recent years?

* Has he any evidence of any lack of **security** in respect of sh p, built in recent years in Australian shipyards?

* I raise very briefly one matter under the Department of Social **Security** estimates.

* If the Cabinet makes that decision tomorrow I am sure that those people will be in this House supporting a proposition whereby persons, through not fault of their own other than that they work for wages in industry, will not receive what the Social **Security** Act says they are entitled to receive.

* If a person of his calibre and qualifications is coming in to head an organisation such as the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation there is need for the protection of what one might call his normal course of responsibility and his normal duty.

* So there should be a protection for the safety and **security** of the country.

* I accept the fact that people given a responsibility in an organisation such as ASIO do not investigate or perhaps spy upon a person's private life in areas where there is no necessity to do so in the interests of the safety and **security** of the country.

* There have been occasions when the CLA has taken action that has protected not only the **security** of the United States but the **security** of other countries as well.

* I have said that if this attitude develops to any marked degree international diplomacy and **security** will be at risk.

* While there may be some groups or some people who feel that at this moment it is to their advantage if this view develops much further, it will be to the detriment of every country in the world and to the detriment of the safety and **security** of those countries and of individuals.

* I believe that organisations such as the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and even the Central Intelligence Agency are necessary in the international scene at the moment for the safety and **security** of individual countries.

* The balance of the staff is made up of officers on loan to the Commission from the Department of Social **Security** and elsewhere, temporary employees, and graduate clerks.

* Up to 30 June 1974, the Commission's staff was included in the staff ceiling for the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Department of Social **Security** is responsible for implementation.

* Committee and Working Party meetings between the staff of the Social Welfare Commission and the Department of Social **Security** are held frequently.

* The other day I pointed out an example of doublespeak on the part of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who, in a statement headed 'Emergency Telephone Interpreter Services in Australia', said that she was most anxious to examine ways and means of improving the efficiency of the service and client help for migrants.

* The Government's objective is to cut expenditure on social **security**.

* People who mention it often have visions of unlimited funds being allocated to all comers with no need for them to prove viability or provide adequate **security**.

* The aspects of viability and **security** in any accountability must be paramount.

* We have not been elected custodians of the taxpayers' money just to squander funds on enterprises that neither are viable nor offer **security**.

* However, by the judicial use of guarantees to recognised small business lending authorities we can promote those businesses that are or will be viable, or we can offer them some **security**.

* The Primary Industry Bank of Australia which was especially set up to make money available to primary producers will not bridge this gap in financing the area where there is insufficient **security**.

* We all know that there is a very strong personal antipathy between the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and there is this constant contest between them for the control of funds.

* I would like to quote what the Minister for Social **Security** had to say about eligibility for unemployment benefits.

* I do not know whether it is the 
Minister for Social **Security** or the Minister for Labour.

* The position is, as I have said, that virtually anybody can claim unemployment benefits by establishing that he is unemployable, and that is what the Minister for Social **Security** sets down as his criterion.

* He should know that when the first Chifley-Evatt statement was made in 1949 there were no qualifications or reservations at all about the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* We should ensure when we are looking at **security** matters that we do so knowing that we believe in the declaration of human rights; that we want to protect the privacy of the individual and his right to conduct his own life in his own way, provided always that he works within the law.

* That also means that he works within the law so far as **security** is concerned.

* He did not protest about the **security** Bill then.

* I wish first of all to evaluate clause 17 of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill, which relates to the function of ASIO.

* Another function is to communicate matters relevant to **security** in accordance with the law.

* Another function is to advise Ministers and authorities of the Commonwealth in respect of matters relating to **security** insofar as those matters are relevant to their functions and responsibilities.

* It is a matter for **security**.

* The **security** with which it is kept is strictly policed to prevent premature disclosure to any person who does not need to know, either as a decision-taker or a decision-implementor.

* The reason why budgets deserve **security** is not a matter of sentimental tradition nor anachronistic convention.

* However the Department of Social **Security** requires persons claiming unemployment benefits to have registered for employment with the CES.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provide the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* No information stored in a computer owned or operated by the Department of Social **Security** is sold, hired or lent to any person or organisation.

* Section 17 of the Social Services Act, which governs the confidentiality of of information between the Department of Social **Security** and its clients, provides for the release of information in the following circumstances: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Department of Social **Security** employs the equivalent of 5 persons on duties associated with staff recruitment.

* The Department of Social **Security** does not engage private employment agencies to assist in the recruitment of staff 
The Department of Social **Security** utilises from time to time the services of the Commonwealth Employment Service to recruit Labourers, Hospital Assistants, Medical Orderlies, Cooks, Nursing Sisters, Tradesmen, Watchmen, Clerks (short-term relief), Clerical Assistants (short-term relief).

* As you know, I am deeply concerned over the implications of further nuclear weapons proliferation for our common **security** and well being.

* What was the expenditure of the Commonwealth before 30 June 1978 for (a) **security** and (b) monitoring and environmental surveys at (i) Maralinga (ii) Monte Bello and (iii) Emu.

* What is the estimated cost of **security** at (a) Maralinga (b) Monte Bello and (c) Emu between 1978 and 2000.

* In the statements which were made by the present Minister for Social **Security** - he has put out a voluminous packet of statements over the last couple of years - he talked about the abolition of the means test being undertaken over 6 years or 2 Parliaments.

* The Government should give us some kind of explanation of the substantial difference between the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the statement of 20th March by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* If one reads the voluminous and sometimes mutually contradictory memoranda which the Minister for Social **Security** put out while he was still a member of the Opposition, people will see what I mean and know what I fear.

* I believe that the Minister for Social **Security**, from his own previous memoranda, will be only too ready and eager to accept Treasury advice in this matter.

* I would be more confident, of course, in this matter if the Department of Social **Security**, which used to be my Department, were still under the control of  Mr L.  B. Hamilton, the former Director-General and one of the most competent officers in the Public Service.

* Since we have the Minister's new appointment as head of the Department of Social **Security** and since honourable members know of the Minister's own ambitions I would feel that perhaps the Weight of Treasury advice - if I can put the Word advice in inverted commas - would be such as to induce the Government not to do the clean thing, not to get rid of the means test but to involve the abolition of the means test, in some other kind of financial shenanigans.

* It had a special set of **security** arrangements.

* Even though it has been so specially designed there has already been one escape from this prison which is supposed to be **security** proof.

* So the situation is in turmoil because of this decision of the New South Wales Government to close the only maximum **security** block in New South Wales and, according to my advice, the only maximum **security** block in Australia considered capable of dealing with the maximum criminal element known as the terrorist.

* There is no proposal available that would have another maximum **security** block in operation within the one month that the New South Wales Premier said it would take him to close Katingal.

* If there should be- and we hope not- incidents of an international nature of a type of terrorist activity that comes near our shores, which are matters that the Federal Government obviously has an interest in and which might have to be dealt with under federal law, then surely we in this Parliament want to know that any persons convicted will subsequently be held in the appropriate maximum **security** prison.

* There are, of course, **security** arrangements that have to be kept and there are necessary measures of secrecy that have to be complied with.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 13 September 1979: 
Further to the Minister's answer to Question No.

* 4528 concerning  Mr Sellwood  *s visit to Malta in June 1975 to discuss social **security** matters  (Hansard,  1 1 September 1979, page 982) did  Mr Sellwood  make a written report on the result of his discussions in Malta; if so, what was the substance of his report and his recommendations.

* What are the outstanding matters of contention on social **security** matters between Australia and Malta.

* What follow-up action has been taken since June 1975 to enter into reciprocal agreements with Malta on social **security** matters.

* Will the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  assure the Committee, if he is not prepared to accept the amendment, that if the Australian Labor Party is still in office and if any cases are still outstanding at the end of this 3-year period, the period will be extended to cover them?

* In regard to the other question relating to statistics applying to reducing the age pension entitlement from 65 years to 60 years, as has happened in New Zealand, I will refer that question to my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* 1 ) Has he received one or more reports from  Mr Justice  Hope on the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* It can only be justified by the fear that the Labor Government has of going to the Australian people in the light of the actions of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  last week in trying to deny the manner of appointment of a former senator as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, and the fear of the Prime Minister of going to the people to justify the actions of the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  in relation to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation exercise.

* I direct his attention to the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  who said: 
That statement may dispel some of the apprehension the honourable member might have had in moving the amendment.

* The Bill must be seen as the first stage of a new concept in social **security**.

* For many years I have been a trade unionist and trade union official, and my years of experience in the industrial sphere of this country have demonstrated to me that the present welfare system, after deteriorating throughout 23 years of Liberal mismanagement, is now a crumbling, fragmented and socially unjust patchwork offering no real social **security**.

* One of the key enthusiasts is the Minister for Social **Security** and it is a matter of great pride to me that my first contribution to discussion in this chamber is in support of the new deal in social **security** he is initiating.

* No longer will social **security** be used in a mean, vengeful spirit against workers in distress.

* Under the previous Government, workers who suffered injuries at work faced not only the impossibility of living on workers compensation payments but also the cruelty of not knowing for sure that they would get any benefit; workers were never sure when they would be facing up to the counter of a Commonwealth Employment Office week after week, having to wait 7 days to accept unemployment benefits which were only a fraction of the real cost of living; workers faced periods of sickness knowing that Commonwealth social **security** sickness benefits would barely keep a family from starvation; workers could never be sure they would not receive an injury at home which left them unemployable, and facing a lifetime on an inadequate invalid pension.

* As a member of the new Australian Labor Government I am pleased to have the opportunity of cementing the first brick in the foundation of a social **security** structure which will put the welfare of the community on a rational, socially-just basis and, for the first time since the last Labor government, offer some hope to the working man and his family.

* Upon that foundation - this commitment to ensure the social **security** of all the people - we can build a new approach to the problems of the nation.

* It is time the balance was restored and that is what I understand by social **security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 

 Mr Sellwood visited Malta in June 1975 mainly for preliminary discussions on general principles on which Australia might enter into reciprocal agreements on Social **Security**.

* I shall quote the reply of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to the Knight figures as reported in the 'Age'.

* Surely the Minister has these figures, because he must have a responsibility, as Minister for Social **Security**, to his Cabinet, to his Party and to his Prime Minister because of overall budgetary requirements in an inflationary situation.

* -The Committee is dealing this afternoon with a cognate debate on the estimates of 3 departments, amongst them being the Department of Social **Security**.

* It takes away from women the **security** and legal safeguards of the present law and, in the guise of enabling marriages which have broken down irretrievably to be dissolved with dignity, enables all marriages to be dissolved on the unilateral decision of either party on 12 months notice.

* His  'wife'- I put that word in inverted commas- would thereby become entitled to obtain entry into Australia and to enjoy all the benefits of social **security**, widow's pension and deserted wife's pension, the same as his first legal wife.

* They will suffer the psychological damage of family collapse, the loss of **security**, torn affections and both emotional and material disturbance.

* They are: Firstly, the maintenance of those parties and their children unable to support themselves without social **security** assistance; secondly, the administrative costs associated with increased demands upon either the existing legal system or the establishment of the Family Court of Australia; thirdly, the increased demands upon the Australian Legal Aid Office, as is provided for in clause 117(3) and (4); fourthly, the probable increased demand for child care centres; and, fifthly, the increased demand for services to deal with the psychological and physical ill-health of disadvantaged one-parent families.

* It provides that the Court shall take into account the eligibility for social **security** benefits when determining maintenance, regardless of the wealth of the husband.

* In its inquiry, the Committee took evidence from the Departments of Services and Property, Social **Security**, Labor, now the Department of Labor and Immigration, Overseas Trade, Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Department of Transport, and the Public Service Board.

* One has only to look at the extent to which it is possible for the Defence Department, on the basis of **security**, to resist any objective standards by which its procurement policy can be objectively tested.

* It was during his tenure of that portfolio that the legislation for the establishment of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation as a statutory body was perfected, the Act being assented to shortly after 
Let me advert to the real issues that are worrying the Australian people at present.

* According to today's Notice Paper, we have to amend three areas of legislation- customs legislation, the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation legislation, and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act- on the basis that what, we did a matter of a few weeks ago was incorrect.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said: 'Well, I am ignorant.

* The Minister for Social **Security** said: It ought to be made perfectly clear that I am not the Minister responsible for Commonwealth Police matters'.

* Mr Lanigan  said: 'Look, there were discussions among a number of departmental heads of the police department, the Attorney-General's Department and the Social **Security** Department in August 1977 on question of a pardon and the question of a reward'.

* Attorney-General's action and statements concerning the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation have amounted to a campaign of denigration and villification of the former Government, its Attorney-General and ASIO.

* It has been a campaign which has clearly jeopardised the future operations of **security** organisations in this country and which has raised directly the spectre of political control over those **security** services.

* With one recent action the Attorney-General has placed the effectiveness of that essential **security** service in great jeopardy.

* The Government asked the public to believe that there was a conspiracy either within ASIO or among senior public servants whose discussion on the question of **security** was subject to the report by ASIO subsequently seized by the Attorney-General and now revealed by the Prime Minister to have been a wrong report.

* It was a massive **security** operation without precedent in the.

* It gives greater **security** to the employees of the Australian Government.

* However there are some aspects of the Bill introduced by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  that the Opposition feels are in need of definite clarification and perhaps alteration for the benefit of all pensioners throughout this country.

* I therefore move the following amendment to the Bill: 
The Minister for Social **Security** and other honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister, quite rightly, during a Press interview stated that this could not be done before the Parliament met and the proposal was placed before the House, because it was necessary to obtain authorisation for such a proposal.

* I realise that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** intended that there should be 2 increases in a financial year, although the average person regards a year as being from Christmas to Christmas.

* They wrote to the Department of Social **Security** and were advised that no funds were available until after 30 June 1979.

* In view of the fact that the parents could not get any assistance under the Handicapped Persons (Assistance) Act through the Department of Social **Security**, they thought: We will have to sit the situation out until after 30 June 1979 and hope that maybe after that date some financial assistance will come'.

* But today there was a slight glimmer of hope after discussions with the secretary to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who gave me a very attentive hearing and a great deal of attention.

* I had discussions with officers of the Department of Social **Security** who deal with handicapped children and they repeated the same message that I had been given in Sydney- no hope, no funds, no fault of theirs.

* But due to the good offices of the secretary to the Minister for Social **Security** there is a faint glimmer of hope.

* It is still being worked on by my Department, the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.

* Grants to individual communities should not exceed the total entitlement of individual members to unemployment benefits as determined by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in consultation with the Department of Social **Security**.

* The initiatives I have outlined involve action to be taken by several Ministers, including the Ministers for Education, Employment and Industrial Relations, Social **Security** as well as myself.

* The fact that the honourable member for Oxley was a former Treasurer and a former Minister for Social **Security** indicates to me that all of these matters that he raises in this amendment should have, indeed if he were genuine in his approach, could have been implemented when he was in government.

* We may well have added perhaps an amendment that the Government deplores the previous Government and the previous Treasurer and former Minister for Social **Security** in not implementing measures outlined in the amendment of the honourable member for Oxley.

* I want to look at the total outlays from the Lynch Budget in the area of health and social **security**.

* It is interesting to note that some 25 per cent of total outlays go to social **security** and welfare.

* Something like 37 per cent or $9 billion of a total Budget outlay of $24.3 billion- a lot of money- is spent in the area of social **security**, welfare and health.

* It is **security** for pensioners that has not been known in this country before.

* -The Opposition does not dispute the **security** angle on this matter, and it never has.

* In fact, the justification for the manner of operation of the former Prime Minister,  Mr E.  G. Whitlam, as indicated in my earlier speech, was the **security** angle.

* The **security** angle is not in dispute.

* -The House is debating 3 measures which are very directly related the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill, the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (No.

* The Opposition will not oppose the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill or the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Bill.

* The purpose of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill is to provide that the recently appointed Director of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation,  Mr Justice  Woodward, should continue to enjoy the rank and status that he enjoyed as a judge prior to his appointment as the Director of ASIO and in all respects to preserve his position having regard to his previous judicial status.

* Honourable members will be aware that quite apart from the effect of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill, which I dealt with a few moments ago, by administrative arrangements control of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation has been transferred from the Attorney-General to the Prime Minister.

* The Opposition will support the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill.

* The honourable gentleman should well understand that the **security** report that was tabled draws together the basis of **security** information which is available to the Government.

* The Minister for Defence also has made it perfectly plain that, as 727s come into service, the rest of the fleet and its use set against modern requirements and present Australian **security** requirements will be assessed with a view to future rationalisation.

* There is no way in which the BAC- 1 1 1 could meet the requirements against the **security** background of 1978 and beyond.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Has the Minister for Defence seen reports that Russia has established supply buoys in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Western Australia, apparently as part of the Indian Ocean supply system for Russian submarines and warships?

* Is there any threat to Australia's **security**?

* Can the Minister assure the people of Western Australia that the defence services in that State are adequate for the continuing **security** of Western Australia?

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The Department of Social **Security** employed 305 inquiry officers (also known as Field Officers) as at 1 May 1978.

* The people he mentioned were the people who kept the **security** files in the United States, the people who would have made the judgments on the ultimate likelihood of a **security** file being required.

* Burgess and McLean were part of a **security** organisation.

* It is a judgment that can ultimately lead to their being denied positions for which they are qualified and to which they are entitled on the basis that a **security** file on them exists.

* I think that the Committee should remember that the commencement of a **security** file on any person is a significant disadvantage to that person, irrespective of whether any subversive or other activity ever takes place.

* -I just said that the words of the clause we are discussing- I cannot think of anything more relevant- say that if an activity or involvement of a person may ultimately be a **security** risk a **security** file can be opened on that person.

* Let us look at the facts about the success of these **security** organisations.

* About how many of them have we been forewarned by the Australian **security** organisations?

* How many people have been disadvantaged in Australia- denied Australian citizenship, denied positions in the Public Service and denied normal civilian rights in Australiabecause of the existence of a **security** file?

* -Sgro and Sidiropoulos, who are both currently members of the Victorian Parliament and who were both denied citizenship of this country by a Liberal government because of **security** reports.

* I can name a business house in South Australia which was closed as a **security** risk because it was in the proximity of Salisbury.

* It was not closed because of any **security** risk but because the **security** officers could not get the favours that they demanded from the proprietor.

* -Mr Deputy Chairman, the word 'ultimately' gives almost unlimited power as to whether to start a **security** file on a person without any specific reason or need for any specific reason where **security** is involved or seen to be involved.

* The word 'ultimately' means that if, in the subjective judgment of an individual public servant who happens to be in **security**, that person ultimately sees a threat- it may be to his own position- in the activities or any activity which is taking place, a **security** file may be started.

* That person can find himself with a **security** file for life.

* Anyone who suggests that the opening of a **security** file on a person does not disadvantage that person, does not know how our system works.

* If the **security** systems around the world had a good record- a record of documents not being leaked and of documents not being found in places where they could disadvantage people who were not friends of certain people- then it might be an acceptable practice.

* If that information is submitted in a secret way to a **security** organisation and if the note which is submitted goes in the person's file, whilst the information may be evaluated as being of no consequence, the collection of such items can be of substantial significance.

* My Government  rededicates  itself to govern for all Australians and to work in partnership with all groups to build an Australia in which its people can have **security**, the knowledge that they can plan ahead with assurance, and that their efforts will be rewarded.

* It was very divisive and it was one which spoke about the important problems with which we are faced in relation to our own **security**, not as members of parliament but as a country.

* It is an absolute disgrace that they would put their personal advantagethe **security** that they have in a job right here and now, an income that they have for their families- before the needs of that organisation to be able to place properly those people who are out of work.

* He does not recollect -or more likely prefers to forget- the spectacular thud of the sortie of his Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  into Sino-Australian relations in China a little over 8 months ago when the Prime Minister proposed a 4-power alliance, including clumsily aligning himself with the Chinese on a fairly sensitive issue which the Japanese were trying to handle delicately; questioned the future **security** of Malaysia and Singapore; raised doubts about the stability of the Indonesian Government; and challenged India's sincerity in its concern for world peace.

* Resolutions in both the **Security** Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations have called on Indonesia to withdraw her troops, to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to operate in East Timor, and to allow for a proper act of self-determination, but these have been ignored by Jakarta.

* Can Australia ever again criticise United Nations agencies, such as the **Security** Council, for their ineffectiveness when, in an international dispute which did not involve a super power confrontation and in which an Australian response could have influenced the course of events, we failed to take up the challenge?

* If so, is any action contemplated to ensure job continuity or **security** for employees of the Authority, particularly those whose age precludes them from taking advantage of ready alternative employment opportunities?

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has told us that the health funds will subsequently be re-registered, if they want to be, to provide benefits for intermediate and private hospital care, but we have not yet seen the legislation to do this.

* Given the consistent denigration and sheer hatred and vituperation which the Minister for Social **Security** has heaped on to the health funds, the Opposition could be forgiven for questioning whether that particular piece of legislation which will permit the private health funds to re-register will ever see the light of day.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has been threatening everybody.

* Would a person co-operate if he were a doctor and he were constantly being told by the Minister for Social **Security** that he was a parasite?

* He acted in exactly the same way as the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* In most communities today, particularly in country areas, the departments operating in this field include the departments of Social **Security**, Labour - that is, commonwealth employment - Immigration, Repatriation, Aboriginal Affairs and Tourism and Recreation.

* This is the fragmented nature of the system that exists and will continue unless action such as that proposed by this magnificent document entitled the 'Australian Assistance Plan' is agreed to by this House and by the Parliament and is implemented by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and his Department.

* Lenders will have confidence in the fact that their **security** is established and protected by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.

* He has expressed the view that in the long term Australia's **security** is less assured now than at almost any other time since Federation.

* Second best, or hoping for the best, is just not good enough where the safety and **security** of our country are concerned.

* The report is so abbreviated from the Hansard that it gives the impression that I was criticising the actual migrants themselves when in fact the Hansard shows I was requesting an inquiry into the matter of hardship, housing and employment **security** and an assurance on these matters to be given to migrants.

* Furthermore, in line with this policy, the Government has supported resolutions adopted during December by the United Nations General Assembly and the **Security** Council.

* The Government now looks forward to the resumed **Security** Council debate in which we shall again be seeking to participate.

* If those who are newly come to power follow the path of negotiation and political settlement, if they reject outside intervention and provocation, if they refrain from interference across their borders and from actions affecting the **security** of their neighbours, there is a hope of orderly change and transition.

* In determining whether finance should be provided, the Development Bank will not necessarily have regard to the value of the relevant **security** but will have regard primarily to the prospects of the operation being successful.

* It is pleasing for those of us who believe that the traditional sources in the banking system in this country are too conservative and look too much to **security** rather than competence and administrative ability that perhaps an additional source of finance will be available not only to the innovators in the community who come to such an enormous extent from small businesses but also to the battlers who can no doubt prove that they are viable and competent and who provide such a splendid service to the Australian community in their particular forms of endeavour.

* In addition to that, they are required to pay higher interest rates than are larger companies which have greater **security**.

* asked the Minister representing  the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 9 March1977: 
What recurrent and non-recurrent expenditures under major programs administered by the Department of Social **Security** in the Electoral Division of Penh were made in 1976.

* For example, representatives of so-called governments not recognised by Australia would not normally be granted visit visas; in considering applications by persons holding Rhodesian passports, or who ordinarily live in Rhodesia, account is taken of the Sanctions against Rhodesia imposed by Resolutions of the United Nations **Security** Council; visitors from Taiwan are required to provide an undertaking relating to their activities whilst here.

* This Government more than any other is pursuing the view that, in **security** matters, briefings from the very **security** agencies of this country, should be available to the Leader of the Opposition and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition.

* Certainly it has been taken so far as the **security** for the Vice-President's visit and other aspects of the matter are concerned.

* Three months ago, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  informed me that there were in excess of 21,000 people in receipt of the pension residing in my electorate and, of course, that does not include probably another 5,000 people who are over the age of 60 but who are not in receipt of a pension.

* The present organisations meet in the community halls that are available to them for hire, but they lack the incentive to develop a more comprehensive entertainment and activity program, as unfortunately they lack the **security** of tenure that comes with pride of ownership.

* They may go to the Commonwealth Departments of Social **Security**, Labour, Repatriation and in some areas Aboriginal Affairs and Immigration.

* We believe that a community office should be provided so that the interviews that are conducted by officers of, say, the Department of Social **Security**, could be conducted at that centre and this fact would become known.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  said in his second reading speech, the allowance should be seen in the context of our broad program of education, training and general welfare for handicapped children being developed by the Government.

* Firstly, application forms will be readily available, not only from the State and regional offices of the Department of Social **Security** but probably also from the voluntary organisations which are likely to have close contact with parents in this field.

* I do not pretend that we have yet provided the ideal in social **security** or that there are no longer anomalies to be corrected, but I do claim that the Australian Labor Government has made unprecedented strides in this direction in only 2 Budgets.

* We urgently require such a maximum **security** quarantine station and diagnostic laboratory established on an off-shore island.

* Techniques have now been developed that will permit the importation into Australia of exotic animals from most countries of the world, provided facilities are available that will allow the close segregation of such animals in a high **security** quarantine station, the testing of them for exotic diseases in the  country of  origin first and again through a high **security** laboratory in this country after their arrival.

* It would have to provide **security** for animals from countries in Africa and the Middle East, with their diseases, as well as to safeguard against the introduction of the foot and mouth problems of northern Europe.

* He overlooked the fact, presumably, that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  to her credit, had promised as long ago as last May that the reports would be debated in Parliament.

* The clear objective is to abdicate Federal responsibility in a whole range of social **security** matters, responsibility undertaken by every other Federal government since the war- Labor, Liberal and Labor again.

* The fact is that new ventures in social welfare or **security**, as in housing, higher education or transport, have, ever since the Second World War, always come from the Federal GovernmentLiberal or Labor- and the original funding for them has come from the Federal GovernmentLiberal or Labor.

* Yet the Minister for Social **Security** admitted in the Senate on 2 December that merely to maintain these programs a greater level of funding was required.

* After consultations with interested groups and a report from the Social Welfare Commission recommending its retention, the Minister for Social **Security** announced on 21 May 1976 that the Government would not continue to fund the program beyond June this year.

* Their **security** of tenure can be protected- I think it is reasonably well protected- without giving them that extra power.

* He would have no **security** of tenure at all.

* It cannot claim credit for our uranium policy because we above all had deep in our philosophy and in our policies the defence and **security** of this country which are very much tied up with uranium.

* How many persons were employed (a) full-time and (b) part-time by the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation as at 30 June 1973.

* The social **security** measures outlined in the Governor-General's Speech quite correctly emphasise the urgency of welfare provisions.

* The Opposition Parties were finally tossed out of office because they refused to make positive decisions on a reserve price scheme, on an acquisition scheme, on a scheme which would give **security** to the wool industry of Australia.

* There was no **security** in the wool industry then.

* What **security** did that deficiency payment offer to the small wool producer?

* Did it offer any **security** for the future?

* But there was still a progressive deterioration of wool prices because **security** still had not been introduced through a minimum floor price scheme- something for which the Labor Party had been fighting for years and years in Opposition.

* It gave **security** to the industry as a whole until the market forces were brought into some semblance of equilibrium.

* They may have worked hard, but it has never been a case of work where one does the job to get the money to get the food to get the energy to do the job and so on  ad infinitum;  it has been hard work where they have always had **security** and could knock off when they wished.

* Following the previous speech, it is appropriate for me to turn my attention to the speech delivered in this House last Tuesday by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* This table was such an expert statistical feat that it caused our shadow Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Chipp,  to exclaim half way through the Minister's explanation of the table, 'What is the source for that table?'

* Being suspicious of most things coming from the new Government I went to work and saw that the Minister for Social **Security** had the complete and utter audacity to include the pension increase which the previous Liberal Party-Country Party Government gave in last year's Budget.

* I am sorry that the Minister for Social **Security** is not in the House.

* In Labor's policy speech at the last election the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said: 
In conclusion I refer again to the fact that the Minister for Social **Security** has connived in presenting a false picture of the position to this Parliament.

* As to the Commonwealth compensation legislation, I understand that my colleague the Minister for Social **Security** will be having discussions with the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations, I believe today, with a view to dealing with its representations for an increase in the rates payable under the compensation Act.

* The Prime Minister said during question time that the reason he was taking the Qantas plane related to **security**.

* He says that he cannot take a BAC1 1 1 aircraft for reasons of **security**.

* It refused to introduce the one thing that stands between disaster and **security** for the wool industry today.

* There has been a report in one newspaper and a radio news bulletin that Vice-President Mondale of the United States of America would not visit Parliament House because the **security** was not adequate.

* **Security** in the countryside bad deteriorated to such an extent that the North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces through a persistent campaign of terror including the assassination of government officials and clandestine coercion, were estimated to be exerting some direct influence on 80 per cent of South Vietnam's population.

* The Australian Government of the day considered this request bearing in mind the overall strategic situation in South East Asia at the time, and taking account of the likely effect on the **security** of the region if the Communist North Vietnamese aggression were allowed to go unchecked.

* Checking the destructiveness of insurgency and replacing it with progress towards **security** and economic and social development is not solely, or even mainly, a military task.

* But the restoration of military **security** had become essential if the normal life of the people of South Vietnam was to be allowed to develop.

* I make it clear that the Government has no desire to have Australian forces in Vietnam any longer than is necessary to ensure the **security** of South Vietnam.

* When the Task Force and its Air Force and logistic support arrived there, South Vietnamese **security** forces were small in numbers, widely dispersed and not as well equipped as the Communist forces.

* The area had a wider significance in relation to the **security** of Saigon because of its command over road links between the capital and the coast, and because of its potential suitability as a base area from which the North Vietnamese and Vietcong might have mounted attacks.

* After May 1969, as a result of the success of its operations, the Task Force was able to place greater emphasis on lower level operations aimed more directly at providing **security** for the population, on improving the capabilities of the local Vietnamese forces, and on isolating the enemy from his sources of information, food and other support.

* The activities of the Task Force in Phuoc Tuy Province over a period of 5 years have given the inhabitants of the Province the time to develop their own **security** forces and to restore the fabric of administration.

* It would be foolish to claim that complete **security** has been restored.

* Greater **security** has been achieved.

* The Navy is providing **security** for the vital traffic on the country's inland waterways, as well as along the coast.

* At the same time the territorial forces have been developed to provide new levels of local **security**, at village and hamlet level against harassment by guerilla raids.

* Although the **security** role still has priority, the Government has been able to place greater emphasis on economic development.

* However the swift assistance provided in its wake proved effective and, with greater **security**, the record since has been one of progressive economic improvement.

* They are achievements largely made possible by the **security** created by allied forces, including Australian servicemen.

* Military **security** has been restored to a level where the people of South Vietnam should be able to take control of their own destiny.

* The concept of collective **security**, therefore, continues to be of vital importance to us.

* The Minister has put increased **security** and an improved economy in strong terms and I accept these claims.

* Through our social **security** services we should look at this problem and help an underprivileged group of people.

* We on this side of the Parliament will maintain our opposition to the nuclear industry, surrounded as it is with unresolved environmental and **security** problems.

* What he did in that ham-fisted way was to deny a substantial part of Malaysia the **security** to which Malaysia as a member of the Five Power Defence Arrangements was entitled.

* We are turning our attention wholeheartedly to developing an Australian defence force which has as its primary objective the **security** of Australian soil.

* On the basis of the **security** of Australian, soil our defence force will have the mobility and flexibility to assist any allies with whom we have commitments.

* There is a great deal of difference in **security** information on the part of public servants and people who are involved in the defence mechanism.

* They have a responsibility not to divulge information because the responsibility for examining national **security** - what really relates to national **security** - is not a matter for generals; it is not a matter for diplomats; it is a matter for the Government.

* It is for the Government to decide what constitutes national **security** and how it should be interpreted.

* There was an agreement with the United States Government which said in Article 3: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 19 April 1977: 
Was a  Mr K.  Milte present at the regional office of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in Canberra on the night of 15-16 March 1973.

* Was  Mr Milte  present at the headquarters of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in Melbourne on 16 March 1973.

* -I rise in this adjournment debate to draw to the attention of the House the proposed demise of the Migrant Community Services Branch of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Department of Social **Security** has recently conducted a staff utilisation review of its social welfare division.

* By contrast with this 40- strong branch in the Department of Social **Security**, the 'ethnic affairs' unit of the so-called Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs consists of a letterhead and about three or four officers rushing around getting in each other's way.

* Yet, incredibly, the staff utilisation review of the Social Welfare Division of the Department of Social **Security** is in the process of recommending that the branch be disbanded and absorbed into a new structure not recognising a specifically migrant oriented branch.

* Such a course of action would serve further to confuse migrants and the Public Service as to just who is responsible for ethnic affairs in this countrySocial **Security** or Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

* Perhaps the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar),  who represents the Minister for Social **Security** in this place, could enlighten us one of these days instead of leading migrants up the garden path and placing them in a situation where they have to rely on a letterhead and four or five officers to look after their needs in this country.

* -A telegram on a matter of urgency was sent to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* Last night the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  suggested to us that if this Bill were put through at once it would enable increases to be paid a fortnight earlier than would otherwise be possible if the normal week's adjournment were taken.

* Our attention at this time is primarily and properly directed towards the recipients of these payments, the social **security** beneficiaries.

* I hope it will be apparent without my needing to say it that that does not in any way suggest an argument against major social **security** advances.

* What I say is no reflection on either the Minister for Social **Security** or the honourable member for Hotham.

* I have identified the procedure as one agreed upon between the Minister for Social **Security** and the Opposition.

* Is it a fact that the Italian Under-Secretary for Immigration,  Mr Bemporad,  during a recent visit to Australia said that many provisions of the Immigration Agreement between Australia and Italy were inadequate and provided little **security** for Italian migrants and requested that it should be brought up to date?

* The honourable member is saying that jeopardy to our **security** system would be avoided by an undertaking given by the present Leader of the Opposition.

* There is an assurance that social **security** pensions and benefits and repatriation payments will be maintained.

* Also in the United States is a Freedom of Information Act which specifies that all information held in government files will be open to public inspection with the exception of information relating to national **security** or the privacy of the individual.

* A study of what has happened in those places has led us to the conclusion that, whilst the Government may be well motivated in the belief that its health scheme will not get out of hand, in practice there is no way of containing the costs of a national health plan such as that proposed by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and that this in itself will be destructive not only of medicine and health care in Australia but also of the economy of this nation.

* The Minister for Social **Security** cannot assure this House or the Australian people that the same will not happen to the national health scheme which is being proposed here.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security** who is sitting at the table: Why does he introduce this legislation right on the eve of the introduction of his so-called scheme?

* I recall clearly the present Minister for Social **Security** standing up when we were in government and asking the then Minister for Health whether action would be taken to ensure that the private health funds did not use one cent of the contributors' money for the promotion of anti-ALP health scheme propaganda.

* I fear that many gullible people in our society will believe the assurances of the Minister for Social **Security** that his health program will be good, when in fact we already have all the signs that the introduction of such a scheme will be disastrous to the health care of this nation.

* 1 would have thought that all honourable gentlemen would be concerned at the statement that was made in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation report from which I quoted.

* The words he uttered, along with the words tonight of many other supporters of the Government, have simply been a precis of the utterances of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I am highly suspicious that all of these prepared speeches have been written by the staff of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  because hardly an original thought has come out in this place tonight.

* Government supporters have been particularly silent on the manner in which the proposed health scheme - a scheme that has been conceived in the womb of the Minister for Social **Security**, a fellow Queenslander - will affect the people of Queensland.

* Day after day the Minister for Social **Security** bleats in this House about how Queensland is going to benefit by the provision of another $3 5m a year - a wonderful thing!

* The Minister for Social **Security** says that four out of five people are going to be better off than they were before.

* Just because there was not a 100 per cent coverage, it does not mean that the Minister for Social **Security** has any justification for tipping the system upside down and trying to introduce a socialist approach.

* The proposed Australian health insurance scheme is just the end of a socialist dream and I am quite sure- 
E revision made for families in the social **security** budget.

* This year's estimates for the Department of Social **Security** must be assessed in the light of the major reforms achieved since the present Government was elected to office in 1975.

* The new social **security** income test imposes a SOc in the dollar rate by which pension payments are reduced as non-pension income rises.

* Though eligibility to pay tax and eligibility for pension are both defined on an annual basis, the Department of Social **Security** makes its assessment for the year in prospect, whereas the Taxation Office is concerned about the year past.

* Those who resist suggestions that there should be a rational integration of Social **Security**'s income test and the test used by the Taxation Office will endeavour to make the differences sound so impressive that they seem insurmountable.

* I contend that the similarity between income for tax purposes and income for social **security** purposes is so strong that ways and means must be found to overcome the differences and the difficulties.

* Without an effective co-ordination between the income test used by the Department of Social **Security** and that used by the Taxation Office, the total tax effect of the rate at which pension is withdrawn and tax liability imposed will deprive those who seek to improve their position of so much of the increase in their non-pension income that incentive to self reliance will be destroyed.

* The legislation provides that a benefit organisation seeking to increase its members' contributions can make a submission to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The benefit organisation has been unable to increase the benefits because it has been unable to negotiate sensible increases with the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The second principle he suggested is that the retirement allowance should be regularly updated according to the cost of living and that when people retire they should not have to worry that their retirement allowance will be eaten away by price inflation.

* It would enable people to retire in self respect and with the **security** of being protected during their retirement.

* The fascination of this country, as of many other countries in the developed world, with the favourable comparison of, for example, Australia's performance as a donor country has tended to obscure the real nature of development and its relevance to Australia's foreign policy, **security** and external economic interests.

* But the proposition that the development issue and Australia's **security** are quite unrelated and therefore our development assistance efforts will have no impact on our long term **security** is misleading, if not untenable.

* The proposition should really be that ineffective development assistance does nothing to promote Australia's **security** interests in the long term.

* An effective aid program will help to promote national well-being and stable political conditions and, as such, an improvement in such a program can only enhance regional **security**.

* I have shown it to the Minister for Social **Security** and he agrees to its incorporation.

* The Country Party supports the legislation, but draws attention to the unjust and iniquitous provisions for those between 65 and 75 years who have been unjustly treated in the new social **security** provisions.

* The Ministers for Education  (Mr Beazley),  Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  were all excluded on this ground, and responsibility was given to the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen).

* In designing tax and social **security** programs we have so often been wholly absorbed in achieving an equitable vertical redistribution of income between the wealthy and the needy that we have overlooked the importance of the longitudinal redistribution between the more affluent periods of our lifespan and those where the requirement and demand on family resources are great and, unless they are supplemented, place us in the category of the needy.

* The unemployment benefit estimate was the subject of calculations by the Department of Social **Security** and the Treasury prior to inclusion in the Budget figures.

* I confirm my advice to you by phone this morning that the  Budget Speech and papers were made available to us at the Commonwealth Treasury Perth office on a **security** basis 1700 hours WST (5 p.m.), which is 1900 hours EST (7 p.m.), on the day when the Budget was presented to the Federal Parliament.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
1 ) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to concern at the delay in hearings of the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunals.

* We are talking about an appropriation of $8,0 15m, an increase of $524m on the actual expenditure last year for social **security** and social welfare, which amounted to $7,490m.

* He concluded his remarks by accusing the entire Department of Social **Security** of being antimigrant.

* I place on record my appreciation of the officers of the Department of Social **Security** in Tasmania, from the Director down.

* Really, how anybody like the larrikin member for Prospect can stand in this chamber and describe the Department of Social **Security** as anti-migrant and get away with it just makes one wonder.

* In that situation surely it is reasonable and responsible for a government to keep matters such as pensions and social **security** payments out of the political arena and for them to be indexed forward according to movements in the consumer price index during the 12 months ending on 30 June.

* What we are giving them is total **security**.

* I want to talk about total **security**, including assistance in the area of housing.

* Recently 182 people in Sydney were charged with defrauding the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social **Security** of between $6m and $6.5m.

* If we are serious about overcoming fraud and if we are serious about directing the taxpayers' money to those most in need, surely there can be absolutely no objection to our introducing a system of identity cards and photographs in relation to people who receive social **security** benefits.

* I hope that some of the 700 extra staff whose salaries are being appropriated in the Budget will be trained especially in methods of identifying the people who should receive social **security** benefits.

* One appreciates the difficulty the Government faces in a tight economic situation, but I hope that the Ministers will as part of the forward planning provide as part and parcel of the Australian social **security** scheme extra assistance to large families because they are the families most in need.

* I want to uphold the social **security** part of this Budget as a decision by a Government which wants to preserve basic family life, which wants to look after old people and which looks after old people in its total concept, not in isolation, but as part and parcel of fiscal responsibility wherein each and everyone has a special right and a special role to play.

* I have noted some of the problems that farmers are having with the assessments of social **security** officers.

* Some real problems exist with some social **security** officers who have an ideological opposition to the payment of any benefit to a self-employed person.

* I am talking about welfare which I believe comes under the heading of social **security**.

* Family lobby groups must become more influential and press more strongly the interests of the family, so that tax and social **security** policies are reformed.

* Until now, the Australian system of taxation and social **security** has had comparatively little effect on levelling out the fluctuations in income requirements associated with an individual 's family life cycle.

* Our tax and social **security** systems must not be used only to safeguard individuals and families against unpredictable and catastrophic loss of income or to enable the chronically disadvantaged to maintain a decent standard of living; they must also be used to assist individuals and families to redistribute their lifetime income from the peaks of relative affluence to those periods of relative poverty which are today putting families under so much stress.

* It is only by considering the systems of taxation and social **security** together that rational and equitable results can be achieved.

* The present tax and social **security** system contains many serious inequities and mean anomalies.

* **Security**, upon notice: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Loans will be available up to a maximum amount of $3,000 except for agricultural purposes, where the limit will be $6,000.

* Adequate **security** or guarantees for a loan will he required.

* In a situation of rising costs and wages it is interesting to note that people are put off work on the ground of redundancy, yet they have contributed to the firm's superannuation fund in the belief that they had **security** until retirement.

* The matter which was raised is more in the nature of a matter of **security** and on that basis I have ruled that no prima facie case exists on the evidence which is contained in the newspaper article.

* The medical and social consequences of abortion including the health, **security**, well being and future enjoyment of life by the woman concerned; 
That the Commissioners have access to all Federal authorities' records relating to health, social **security**, matrimonial causes and income tax and have power to seek the co-operation of the respective State authorities in these jurisdictions and including the State Law Enforcement and Child Welfare agencies.

* No doubt the Department of Social **Security** would have the numbers available.

* If not, I am sure the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will provide the information for the honourable member.

* I move: 
What is the legality of the Attorney-General's actions in relation to the events of 16th March at Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation offices in Canberra and Melbourne and the way in which officers of ASIO were treated; 
Greenwood had known at the rising of the Parliament on 27tn October last year.

* I do not believe that the Director-General of **Security** has said that Attorney-General Hughes and his 2 successors were indifferent although  Senator Murphy  has said that the DirectorGeneral did say it.

* The truth of that needs to be established to see whether the misstatement of truth was made by the Attorney-General or by the Director-General of **Security**.

* The whole matter of the visit to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters was in the context of the visit of the Yugoslav Prime Minister.

* At about midnight on 15 th March after the Senate had risen the Attorney-General, accompanied by his Private Secretary and - as the Attorney-General described him - 'a  Mr Milte',  arrived at the offices of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in Canberra.

* Today the Prime Minister tabled the terms and conditions of appointment of the DirectorGeneral of **Security**.

* The Director-General is required to 'keep secret all matters which come to his knowledge or into his possession by virtue of his office except insofar as any such matter may in accordance with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act 1956 ... be communicated to another person'.

* It was led to believe that the matter related to national **security** of the life of the Yugoslav Prime Minister.

* Assembled in Canberra was the greatest **security** force in the history of Australia.

* We have since learned that the Attorney-General was advised by his **security** advisers that the visit should be called off.

* ASIO has established close relations leading to the interchange of intelligence information with the **security** services of our allies and other countries in the Western world.

* Australia, just like any o:her country, would be risking its national **security** if it did not have such an organisation.

* In spite of a barrage of misleading and derogatory propaganda, ASIO has a reputation of being one of the best and most responsible **security** services in the world.

* This would deprive Australia of important knowledge which it is necessary to have in the maintenance of Australia's national **security**.

* Almost from the commencement of this Labor Government reports were cropping up - some originating overseas - that the intelligence systems of friendly countries were concerned about the **security** of information in Australia.

* The concern grew further over the Prime Minister's opportunist and politically motivated revelation of part of our **security** arrangements in Singapore.

* We must maintain our national **security**, which is a Government's first national priority.

* Action by a government against that **security** is that government's greatest crime.

* Agents are a fundamental source of information gathered to protect our **security**.

* The agents' job is to penetrate groups about whom it is necessary for the state, for the **security** of the state, to have information.

* What trust in the **security** of critical and sensitive information will foreign agencies now place in ASIO?

* By the kindest interpretation, then, the AttorneyGeneral is not fit to be in charge of our **security** forces and certainly not the expanded and increased police power he is trying to amass for himself.

* I refer to the disclosures about the Singapore **security** to a restricted group of journalists which became known within a matter of hours.

* The judicial inquiry should call before it under oath all the persons involved in the matter, including the Director-General of **Security**, his officers and Commonwealth Police.

* In this respect it is noteworthy that of an estimated outlay for 1976-77 totalling $24,320.9m almost half is made up by health expenditure of $2,908.7m, education $2,204m, social **security** and welfare $6,187.1m- and I might mention that constitutes 25 per cent of total outlays- and culture and recreation $253.

* This will give them additional **security**.

* I am very loath to trust it with the future **security** of a very large number of people who, if they continue to live in the community, will probably continue to live here undetected.

* Why should I advise them to give up the relative freedom and **security** they now have apart from their fear, when within 24 hours they could find themselves on a boat back to Yugoslavia or some other European country?

* Instead of being glib and saying that we have to restructure without really knowing what it means, why does the Parliament not say that we ought to be looking at these questions of restructuring because the most important thing to the Parliament is the **security** of the employee and the way in which we are able to attract investment, both locally and overseas.

* The Department of Social **Security** issues to pensioners in Tasmania cards which entitle them to free government rail transport.

* Pursuant to section 148 of the Social Services Act 1947 I present the annual report of the Department of Social **Security** for the year ended 30 June 1976.

* The House should proceed to discuss what is after all the first consideration of any Government - the **security** and the welfare of the nation.

* Quite apart from the contractionary effects of financing the deficit, this country has already observed the phenomenon of higher savings ratios as increased inflationary expectations are coupled with expectations of employment and **security**.

* I have noticed from the White Paper on Defence and from previous Government statements that the Government has always maintained that its first responsibility is to provide the nation with **security** from armed attack and from the constraints on independent national decisions imposed by the threat of such attack.

* I know that honourable members on both sides of the House await with great expectation the statement on **security** matters to be made today by the Prime Minister.

* Clear guidelines and further decisions will have to be taken and, consistent with **security** arrangements, these ought to be published.

* The Minister stated that the training component which will be added to the unemployment wage is to be based on a means test and that the means test will be reviewed possibly in the very near future by the committee undertaking a review of income **security**.

* Data held by the Health Insurance Commission will  relate only to the Department of Social **Security** card numbers and not to the names of patients.

* Fund employees who currently have access to patient histories are not subject to any legislation concerning the privacy of history data, whereas all Commission employees under the new scheme will be subject to strict **security** provisions enforceable by law.

* The Commission's health insurance number, which will aid data **security**, has been carefully designed to ensure that it cannot be manually assembled from personal details and that these details cannot be derived from an examination of the number.

* Presumably the member's number will also be used as an aid to data **security** and for computer processing.

* Safeguards will be included in the legislation to the effect that the use of health insurance cards will be restricted to programs administered by the Department of Social **Security**.

* In order that the interests of the patient be represented, the Minister for Social **Security** has arranged for a representative from the Medical Consumers Association to be a member of the study group.

* Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* -Clause 9 relates to warrants authorising the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to intercept telecommunications.

* Clause 10 deals with the issue of a warrant by the Director-General of **Security** in an emergency.

* We propose to omit the words 'the Director-General of **Security** may' and substitute 'the Attorney-General may orally authorize the Director-General of **Security** to' issue a warrant.

* If the Attorney-General has not, to the knowledge of the Director-General of **Security**, made a decision, the Director-General can bring into operation his emergency powers.

* Our amendment proposes that the power of the Director-General of **Security** to take these actions on his own initiative be deleted.

* I am told by a solicitor in Canberra that there are difficulties in bringing maintenance proceedings, particularly by deserted wives who have to establish that they have made an effort to obtain maintenance in order to obtain social **security** benefits.

* She applied for welfare assistance and had to wait 6 months in order to qualify for social **security** benefit.

* Having qualified for the social **security** benefit, she found that the Department took into consideration her welfare payments and the $15 a week.

* Therefore she was no longer eligible for social **security** benefit so she could not get any legal aid.

* One of the solutions on this basis is that the Australian Legal Aid Office or its equivalent or the profession itself ought to be able to say as a profession that it has had a look at a particular case and that there is no need to put the person to the worry and expense of trying to institute maintenance proceedings before such person would be deemed to qualify for social **security** benefit.

* Why not leave it for the profession itself to certify that in view of the facts before it, it deems that this particular person is eligible for maintenance assistance but could not get it and accordingly should be entitled to get the social **security** benefit?

* Again it is suggested for future consideration that perhaps the Department of Social **Security** might pay the welfare benefit or the social **security** entitlement plus the amount awarded by the court on the basis that the Department of Social **Security** could recover that amount from the person compelled to pay the award and not have the unfortunate wife trying to enforce this arrangement.

* Although it is not accepted that there was necessarily any error on the part of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, arrangements have been made with the Department of Social **Security** to see if it is possible to back-date his eligibility for invalid pension benefits to the same period for which he was paid service pension, and to apply the arrears of invalid pension to the overpayment of service pension.

* Somebody such as he, working for the **security** service- at the time we did not have a **security** service of this type to protect us- writes out the details which go in a report somewhere.

* In many respects that legislation prevents the people who are involved in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation from being a general part of the community.

* My impression is that the **security** service becomes an increasingly isolated life in which an evaluation is likely to be made out of that background.

* Clause 18, page 7, at the end of sub-clause (3) add 'which consent shall not be given unless the Attorney-General is satisfied that the communication the subject of the prosecution had, or would be likely to have, the effect of seriously prejudicing **security***.

* Under clause 18 a person is unable to communicate any information or matter that has come to his knowledge by reason of having been an officer or employee of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* We say that it has to be with the consent of the Attorney-General, 'which consent shall not be given unless the Attorney-General is satisfied that the communication the subject of the prosecution had, or would be likely to have, the effect of seriously prejudicing **security**'.

* We would like to think that, if there were some matter of close **security**, there could be an opportunity for an officer to talk to the judicial auditor about matters.

* We are not here to say that there has not to be some obvious prohibition against the disclosure of information which relates to **security** or which would prejudice officers in that intelligence organisation.

* St George is one of the few towns that has developed and grown in population and that has **security** as a result of this irrigation scheme.

* Perhaps there will be some increase in production but I point out that where there is assured production there is a **security** that does not apply where these particular facilities do not exist and where people are dependent on dry land farming.

* Little is said about what **security** of production means.

* -I think all members of Parliament will be pleased at the way in which the **security** methods at Sydney Airport worked out yesterday.

* Australia, as a member state of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, is required to establish an aviation **security** program which meets standards prescribed by international agreements.

* Honourable members may be interested to know that, because of Australia's work in this field, and as a measure of the esteem in which Australia is regarded, ICAO has asked this country to host an international seminar on aviation **security**.

* The Australian aviation **security** program applies at all international and major airports and involves close co-ordination between my Department and the Commonwealth and State police forces.

* Yesterday's incident demonstrates that our aviation **security** procedures are effective.

* Airport **security** measures are reviewed continuously in the light of Australian and overseas experience.

* My advice is that the internal **security** measures adopted at Australian airports compare more than favourably with those at most international airports around the world.

* As the submissions from the West Arthur, Murray, Ravensthorpe, Lake Grace and Kent Community Committees to the Southern Region Social Development Board for assistance under the Australian Assistance Plan concerns a health service, they were referred to my Department by the Department of Social **Security** to ascertain if financial assistance could be granted under any existing health program.

* The Department of Social **Security** has been advised that, although the Hospitals and Health Services Commission is investigating health transport services with a view to making recommendations which could include proposals for the orderly funding of such services, no funds are available in 1 974-75 for providing the assistance requested.

* They depend upon the **security** of the societies which use this technique.

* I have a profound and growing scepticism about what might be called the whole 'cult of **security**' and its associated frame of mind.

* In opposition to the cult of **security** I would like to advocate and promote an intellectually based scepticism.

* The cult of **security** is based on the fallacy that the safety of this nation, and others like it, depends in large part on the maintenance of an intelligence organisation which guards the nation 's secrets and protects its organisations and leaders, apart from normal police protection.

* The apologists for the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation believe- very sincerely in some cases- that somewhere there is a collection of files marked 'TOP SECRET' or 'UMBRA' which contain the nation's secrets and if these precious documents were exposed the **security** of the nation would be imperilled.

* We are told that we should accept the findings of  Mr Justice  Hope in his report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* I suspect that the Government may have used him in order to allay fears about the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill, which he has done with great success.

* Temperamentally, one group is timid, anxious, fearful of external threats, seeking psychological support from authority figures and other support systems, convinced that there are vital secrets locked away somewhere which, if revealed, will destroy the **security** of the world in which it lives.

* The need for a **security** service is, for that group, not just a parrot phrase, but a matter of psychological- perhaps even physiologicalnecessity.

* The problem with the first group is that it may become despairing about the possibility of society solving its difficulties, may adopt a paranoically threatening view of the external world and may look to a **security** service rather than a well informed, vigorous and sceptical democratic system to maintain stability.

* In other words there is less reliance on the political process and more reliance on the **security** system.

* Of course each **security** organisation pours into the credulous ears of its political masters exactly what it wants them to hear.

* ASIO failed dismally in its handling of **security** at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sydney which culminated in the tragic bomb incident at the Hilton Hotel.

* We do know that ASIO spent a good deal of time snooping around trade unions trying to find out what unionists were doing but so far as actual, active, serious work in **security** is concerned in relation to subversion, real or apparent, and trying to deal with terrorism ASIO has no track record at all.

* The **security** of Australia depends not on ASIO but on an alert, informed and sceptical Australian democracy.

* I ask leave of the House to incorporate in  Hansard  paragraphs 208 to 221 of  Mr Justice  Hope's fourth report on the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* As in the case of the organization and of their members, the communication of this intelligence can only be a matter of concern for ASIO, or justified, if it is judged to affect or to be in the interests of **security**.

* Activities do not affect **security** merely because they make for, or do result in, industrial disruption.

* Evidence is available to me that satisfies me that ASIO has in the past provided selected people with **security** intelligence material for publication.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The credit union movement has assisted people to purchase household items.

* Recognition is paid to the applicant's ability to pay but in most cases no **security** is sought.

* I address my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* If we look at clause 21, we find that the Director-General is obliged under statute 'to consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives for the purpose of keeping him informed on matters relating to **security**'.

* Is anybody in this Parliament going to suggest to me that, if there is a **security** risk in this chamber or in another House, the Director-General will not inform the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition?

* The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said in reply to me earlier that he knows very well that a Minister cannot be forced to answer a question on **security**.

* Let us say that the Attorney-General is asked a Dorothy Dixer whether there is an Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation file on an Opposition senator or an Opposition member of this chamber.

* I know that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is genuinely concerned about the **security** of this country.

* If we want a politicised **security** organisation, if we want a Federal Bureau of Investigation or SS type operation in Australia, put it in the hands of a Minister.

* At best, the Government has tried- after the event, after each crisis- to guarantee the **security** of depositors.

* The Federal Government should have responded to this situation by taking steps immediately to increase the **security** of building societies and the community's confidence in the societies.

* Such a situation is intolerable when the **security** of savings of hundreds of thousands of Australians is at risk in institutions providing over a quarter of all lending for housing.

* Doctrinaire neglect by this Government is directly to blame for the undermining of the faith of hundreds of thousands of Australians in the **security** of their life savings and the most important investment they can ever make.

* Such co-operation and development would contribute to regional **security** and stability.

* Consultations between ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum's Bureau of Economic Co-operation would be a practical and a positive means of achieving more effective regional co-operation and could make a significant contribution to growth and **security** in the Asian-Pacific region.

* It is in Australia's **security** interests in present circumstances for the United States to maintain the balance of naval forces in the Indian Ocean.

* The Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  recently acknowledged that the United States North West Cape installation is an essential element in Australian **security**.

* It is this perverse approach to foreign policy that has contributed to the Labor Party's off-handed treatment of Australian **security** and defence forces.

* Our commitment to the ANZUK force was a gesture symbolising our commitment to the **security** of the region.

* It emphasised our willingness to co-operate in a practical way with our neighbours in the interests of regional **security**.

* Australia has particular opportunity to work for this end because our distinguished Ambassador to the United Nations,  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre, is this month  President  of the **Security** Council.

* It is unfortunate that the **Security** Council's efforts in this regard are limited to those which it can make under its own intrinsic authority.

* None of the belligerents in the Middle East has sought the assistance of the **Security** Council.

* None of the great powers, two of whom back the conflicting parties, has moved in the **Security** Council.

* I adopt the words which  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre used at the last meeting of the **Security** Council, when he said: 
There have been 4 meetings of the **Security** Council at the instance of the Australian  Chairman  of that 'body.

* I hope honourable members will appreciate that in answering questions on this issue I shall try to do 3 things - first, to avoid, as far as I can, dissension in this community; secondly, to do all I can to bring an end to the hostilities; and thirdly, to say nothing which will make more difficult the application of the principles of Resolution 242, which was unanimously passed by the **Security** Council over 6 years ago.

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**.

* According to the official guidelines of the Department of Social **Security**, and I quote from section 7, sub-section 101, of" the Department's Manual of Instructions, 'the test whether a person is self-employed or unemployed is applied realistically'.

* Adequate provision for the **security** of Australia is the fundamental objective of the Government.

* Until he has abandoned that doctrine the **security** of this country is not firm or secure and cannot be substantial.

* I received a draft copy of the Social Services Bill at 6 p.m. tonight, As with all Social Services Bills it is fairly complex in parts, and I take it from the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  on trust that there is nothing in the Bill in fine print that is not in his second reading speech, because the Liberal Party has not had a full opportunity to go through the text of the Bill as we would have liked to do as a responsible Opposition.

* I do not want to be unduly critical of the Minister for Social **Security**, who personally to me is the soul of co-operation, but I was astonished - if I may intrude this matter - to be telephoned by a representative of the Press tonight at 9 o'clock just before I was about to speak and asked: 'Would you care to comment on a statement just made by the Minister for Social **Security** on private health insurance?'

* I would like to refer to some statements made by the Minister for Social **Security** which I regard as rather pathetic.

* This criticism is not levelled necessarily at the Minister for Social **Security** who, as the Minister responsible for pensioners and the indigent, cares for them.

* My colleague, the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  will be talking about that part of this Bill which affects his area of responsibility - unemployment benefits - and in particular about the difference of opinion that apparently exists between the Minister for Social **Security** and the Minister for Labour.

* In conclusion, I respond to the taunt of the Minister for Social **Security** to my Party about its attitude to the Labor Party's claim for pensions to rise to 25 per cent of the average weekly male earnings seasonally adjusted.

* Honourable members will remember those infamous St Patrick's Day raids on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation in 1973 which even the present Leader of the Opposition, as Prime Minister, acknowledged was the biggest blunder of the Labor Government.

* It is quite clear that these Bills will start to implement the following statement, which was made about a year ago by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden): 
The economists say that the Government has understated the total cost in the first year and also that the scheme will cost the taxpayers, collectively and individually, more than the existing scheme.

* It is regrettable that the Minister for Social **Security** constantly has attempted to refute criticisms of his proposals, whether medical or statistical, by resorting to personalities and misrepresentation.

* The Minister for Social **Security** also has misled the House in many of his answers to questions and/ or has refused to give background statistical criteria to members of this House in order that those criteria could be compared by all concerned with estimates of the costs and ramifications of the health scheme as calculated by independent economists.

* There is more violent complaint in the community today from workers and unionists, employers organisations, manufacturers, farmers, small business men, educationists, environmentalists, State governments, local governments, migrants and recipients of social **security** benefits than there ever was during the three years of Labor Government.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 31 May 1978: 
1 ) What research facilities exist within the Department of Social **Security** for monitoring and evaluating the social impact of policies administered by that Department.

* This has several potential drawbacks, the first one being that the French may argue that matters of national **security** are involved and that the World Court had no jurisdiction in such a case.

* In any case the World Court has no power to enforce its injunctions unless the **Security** Council decides to support it.

* This is not a possibility because both France and China would veto any **Security** Council action.

* He said that activities do not affect **security** merely because they may cause, or do result in, industrial disruption.

* Is the Government seriously suggesting that a file has to be started on everyone involved in that strike because for the first time they have come under the eye of **security**?

* In a time of world outcry for top level protection against hijacking and threats to personal **security** of airline passengers and crew, a building such as the present terminal is impossible to secure satisfactorily.

* Sir Robert  Mark's report on terrorism and **security** in Australia, we are told, insisted on the aircraft purchase; the Finance Minister told us.

* In this exercise it is not **security** that is at risk; it is the Prime Minister's personal comfort.

* Was **security** again at risk- after all, the aircraft are only pieces of defence equipment- or was it the Prime Minister's face it was trying to save?

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has an obsession with the past.

* Maybe the welfare organisations could be deputed as agents to pay the money out in trust and then substantiate their claims with the Department of Social **Security**.

* In the 1973-74 Budget the increase in social **security** and welfare payments was 18.4 per cent; the overall expenditure in all of the other items was 20.2 per cent.

* To be fair, in the 1974-75 Budget the increase in social **security** and welfare payments was 38 per cent, but nevertheless it was less than the increase for education, for urban and regional development, for culture- whatever that means, and we know that there have been massive increases in expenditure in the name of culture in recent times- and indeed for recreation.

* The Department of Social **Security** knows that he will not get a job.

* I am certain that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  knows of men like this who will not get jobs but in order to keep the statistics right this man was denied unemployment benefits and was left without funds for 6 or 8 weeks.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions: 
1 ) The Minister for Social **Security** has responsibility for co-ordinating Australia's participation in the International Year of the Child (IYC).

* The Minister for Social **Security** is the  Chairman  of a Committee of Commonwealth Ministers set up by the Government to co-ordinate the Commonwealth response to the IYC.

* Details of the formation of this Committee were given by the Minister for Social **Security** in a news release of 5 March 1 978.

* The secretariat offices are located in the Sydney Headquarters of the Department of Social **Security**.

* To date, the Minister for Social **Security** has made two announcements concerning Australia's participation in the IYC: 
Thursday, the need for a chartered aircraft arose from questions of **security**.

* I have given a copy of the **security** advice to the Leader of the Opposition.

* For instance, in the last 3 financial years the honourable gentleman has had a total of 161 chartered flights within Australia- 
The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has indicated in his second reading speech that departmental officers will be liberal in their interpretation of those in need.

* But the existing organisations will fail in their objectives and in the objectives of all of us who are concerned that every senior citizen should have the opportunity of having suitable accommodation in his or her retirement if the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  through has failure to recognise the.

* The Minister for Social **Security** is alarmed that the proportion of funds provided by charitable organisations as their share of the cost of developing home units and which is generally raised from ingoing donations has gone from 35 per cent to 62 per cent.

* If they were to sell their homes for$15,000 or $20,000 and make a contribution by way of outright gift to an aged persons homes organisation to enable that organisation to build further accommodation, it would give them **security** in retirement, it would give them comfort in small modern self-contained accommodation; it would give them, as an increasing number of these orgainsations do, ongoing care in the event of their frailty or in the event of their sickness, and current care in the event of their immediate welfare need.

* The question of their financial resources will be of far less significance than is suggested by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* It will be recalled that the communique issued at the conclusion of the latter visit stated,  inter aiia-  Both sides were agreed on the urgent need for the implementation of Resolutions 242 ( 1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations **Security** Council, ' i.e.

* I address a question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I want to use the brief time available to me to speak in support of the appropriation for the Department of Health mainly, and in brief in support of that for the Department of Social **Security**.

* Why for example, in the face of a massive **security** problem and in the face of clear evidence that the people of Australia did not want the Yugoslav Prime Minister,  Mr Bijedic,  to come here shortly after the Government came to office, did the Government go ahead with the visit?

* The same  Mr Bhutto  was the apologist in the United Nations **Security** Council for the action of the Pakistan Government in suppressing the independence movement, the national liberation movement- mark the words the national liberation movement'- in Pakistan during the Pakistan civil war in 1 97 1 .

* We are keen to be friends with you', notwithstanding the fact that 2 years earlier that man stood up in the **Security** Council of the United Nations, as the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, and defended every act of the then Pakistan military regime.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
There is increasing and profoundly disturbing evidence that foreign espionage and intelligence activities are being practised in Australia on a wide scale.

* Nothing less is at stake than Australia's **security** and integrity as a sovereign nation.

* I asked the Prime Minister to draw this matter to the attention of  Mr Justice  Hope, who has been inquiring into the intelligence and **security** services for investigation and report.

* We now know from the publication of a secret telex message from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation representatives in Washington to the Director-General that  Mr Richard  Stallings who was in charge of the construction of a facility in Australia and was the first head of that facility, was not an employee of the Defence Department but of the Central Intelligence Agency.

* Does this signify some change in our bilateral intelligence **security** related fields.

* Here was a foreign intelligence service telling Australia's domestic **security** service to keep information from the Australian Government.

* Is it not more rational, more realistic, indeed more patriotic, to examine these charges calmly to see whether there is any evidence of damage to our national **security** or institutions?

* I was briefed in confidence on American facilities in Australia and the operations of our own **security** and intelligence services.

* My Government took the first steps in a quarter of a century to establish Australian sovereignty over Australia's intelligence and **security** services and to assert the principle of their accountability to Parliament.

* Our dignity and self-respect as a nation, no less than our national **security**, demand that the Parliament exercise its supremacy in scrutinising the activities of foreign intelligence services operating in this country.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Seaports at which overseas vessels call, and where incinerators have not, in the interests of disease **security**, been provided, are as listed below.

* In 1967-68, ten years ago, this Government had a total commitment to health, education and social **security** and welfare of $ 1,571m.

* On reading through the report of the Australian Taxation Office and associating it with social **security** payments and other such expenditures, I found that in 1978-79, of every dollar that the Commonwealth collects in excise, indirect taxation and other sources of revenue, 42c will be spent on health and welfare and 23c will go to the States and local government.

* There are abuses in the taxation area, but there are also abuses in the social **security** area.

* It is unfortunate that today the average Australian will take advantage of the social **security** system and will take his chances as far as taxation is concerned.

* I certainly feel that in this computer age, when the processing of tax returns is so highly computerised, as is the situation in other areas, such as health, social **security**, et cetera, what we are fast requiring in this country is an identification number for every taxpayer and every citizen.

* I believe that an identification number for every Australian, for social **security**, health and every other area in which he is in contact with the government, is an absolute necessity.

* Honourable members will know that on 26 September I announced that the Government had decided to appoint  Mr Justice  A. E. Woodward, O.B.E., to be the head of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* He is to take up his new duties on 24 November 1975 and it is intended that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill will come into effect on that day.

* Arising from the Government's decision to appoint a judge to head the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, this Bill ensures that such an appointment of a judge does not affect his tenure of office as a judge, or the salary, allowances and other rights and privileges that he has by virtue of his judicial office.

* There is no such provision in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act as it now stands and what the Government is proposing is in line with similar provisions which have been passed by this Parliament on other occasions.

* In accordance with the policy of the Government, the opportunity is being taken to change references to 'the Commonwealth' in the existing Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act and the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act to 'Australia ' or 'Australian '.

* This change is proposed following the revised administrative arrangements order made on 26 September whereby the administration of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Act was transferred to the Prime Minister.

* Much more importantly, however, I question the effect it may have on the **security** of our male Public Service population.

* I was happy to play some part in drafting the Commonwealth's expression of support for the General Assembly and **Security** Council resolutions calling for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed forces, and in the Commonwealth's establishment of a committee, which included Australia, to follow developments in Cyprus and to assist in every possible way towards the early implementation of the United Nations resolutions.

* They also know that this Government and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  have corrected more anomalies in the social service field and have done more to give real effect to our social service requirements in 2 years than the previous governments did in 23 years.

* I am grateful for the branch of the Department of Social **Security** that has been established at the Northlands centre and the way in which that branch is conducted by  Mr Carlton  and his staff who attend to the problems of the people in my area in a prompt manner.

* But of course it would be quite obvious that we are broadening the scope of social **security** in this legislation.

* I know that with the attitude to social **security** of this Government, refinements will be made to take into consideration all these other factors.

* There is a blurring between handicap for social **security** purposes, handicap for educational and remedial purposes, and handicap for rehabilitation purposes.

* The Minister for Social **Security** indicated in his second reading speech that we should consider the new allowance in the context of a broad program of education, training and general welfare for handicapped children.

* -I shall convey the terms of that question to the Minister for Social **Security** who, undoubtedly, will make the necessary inquiries on the honourable member's behalf and give him a full answer.

* I should like to make it clear that since this Government came to office the pensioners of Australia have attained a sense of **security** that they had never achieved before.

* The issues of peace and **security** in Europe, which have included the questions of recognition and acceptance of Europe's postwar frontiers, have a central importance to global **security** which has been recognised by successive Australian Governments.

* While no formal peace treaty has been concluded, these treaties accorded acceptance of the established boundaries of the FRG, GDR and Poland (including of course the Oder-Neisse line) and paved the way for the Conference on **Security** and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).

* During his absence the Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Guilfoyle,  will act as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

* The Leader of the Opposition simply said that his Government would maintain spending in the social **security** area.

* It is worth bearing in mind that these reductions in the deficits are being made in the context of indexation of taxation and social **security** payments and the like.

* The indexation of taxation represents a considerable forfeiture of revenue and the indexation of social **security** payments represents a considerable fixed increase in payments.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The period of suspension may vary depending on the circumstances of the particular case but where payment is suspended, every effort is made to quickly resolve the question of continuing entitlement and to advise the beneficiary of the outcome.

* In some cases, however, where the beneficiary has failed to provide information despite at least two requests, the Department of Social **Security** will continue the suspension until the beneficiary supplies the necessary information.

* In either of these situations it would not be proper administration for the Department of Social **Security** to continue payments in full or in part where there is doubt as to eligibility.

* and (2) Relocation of the Department of Social **Security** is under consideration.

* The current rental being paid for accommodation for the Department of Social **Security** is $1.75 per square foot per annum.

* A thorough investigation has been made of all accommodation available in the Fountain Plaza area but none is considered suitable for the Department of Social **Security** having regard to its requirements such as ground floor accommodation and easy access for the public.

* functions such as education, roads and transportation, and health and social **security**, but hitherto there has been no overall policy attempt that seeks to co-ordinate the work of 
The Australian Government realises that it has to pay respect to the existing historical organisational structure of local government.

* This should not be offensive to local government bodies because many of them are already grouped in a variety of ways, for a variety of functions - for example, regional libraries, social **security**, administration of justice, refuse disposal and so on.

* This will be so because this Government is motivated by egalitarian values without which poverty will never be eliminated and economic **security** never assured.

* There are many other important ways in which action can and must be taken to eliminate poverty and to provide economic **security** to all.

* A government which is concerned to maintain the economic **security** of its people must give the highest priority to full employment.

* To do so is not only the decent and humane thing to do; it could also represent a very rewarding investment in our future national **security**.

* Having visited those countries, I have found in each of them an aspiration for peace and **security** and an aspiration for an opportunity to develop their countries for the well-being and happiness of their peoples.

* So far as research is concerned, the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped and the Department of Social **Security** are conducting or financially assisting research into various aspects of rehabilitation.

* To this end the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  met with Ministers of State governments on 10 May last year for exploratory discussions on whether the States wished to co-operate with the Commonwealth in the joint development of a national compensation plan or whether they would prefer to develop plans separately on a State by State basis.

* The committee met for the first time on 23 and 24 June 1976, and it was resolved that the Department of Social **Security** should prepare working papers for consideration by State officials, which led to the preparation of a comprehensive document.

* Mr HAYDEN (Oxley- Minister for Social **Security**) - I would like to make a personal explanation.

* We were sitting here in this chamber when the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  made the position quite clear.

* It was made very clear by the Minister for Social **Security** on a number of occasions in answer to questions, when speaking and also in answer to correspondence.

* The best evidence that these deliberate attempts at misrepresentation have been occurring is the fact that the Minister for Social **Security** made a personal explanation in this Parliament at 4 p.m. last Wednesday because of the various stories which had been appearing in various segments of the Press and radio, and after the Minister had made that statement the news bulletins on various radio stations- not all radio stations- the Melbourne 'Herald' and also the Brisbane Press continued to carry the story, despite the denial and the firm undertaking given by the Minister for Social **Security** that there would be an autumn increase in the pension to bring it up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* What sort of attitude is it, if **security** is any form of concept to be taken into account in defence policy or foreign policy, to determine in early 1974 that no matter what the circumstances in 1985, when the agreement supposedly comes to and end, the agreement will not be extended?

* I would have thought the prudent course of action by any person, irrespective of ideology, would have been to assume that the agreement should run to its date of destination, 1988, and to assess the circumstances then- the requirement for **security**, the requirements for communication.

* Irrespective of the **security** situation, irrespective of the arrangements into which we have entered, irrespective of the threats that may exist at that time, irrespective of the global problems facing the world, the Labor Party says 13 years before the curtailment or cessation of an agreement that under no circumstances will it extend it.

* The importance of the North West Cape for Australia is that it is- we will state it frankly and we will not run away from it- a cornerstone of Australia's **security**.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The additional cost of increasing social **security** pensions and benefits in May 1980 by the increase in the Consumer Price Index from June quarter 1979 to December quarter 1979 is estimated to be of the order of $51m in 1979-80.

* I stressed that I believed that resolution 242 of the **Security** Council should be observed- in other words, that there should be termination of all claims, states of belligerency, and respect for sovereignty and territorial independence.

* We discussed only one problem, and that was resolution 242 of the United Nations **Security** Council.

* It is a concern for those who are eligible and who have qualified for social **security** and have satisfied the qualifications to take that social **security** with them overseas.

* When we consider the contribution that residents of this country have made we realise that social **security** is not just a question of how much tax we pay to finance our social **security** system but also what one receives in return.

* It does underscore one of the basic reasons why people return to their mother country and reminds the House that one of the reasons for bringing in this social **security** Bill is a recognition that we must update and improve our social **security** and provide better value for each dollar spent on it so that it can stand comparison with the social **security** systems in the countries from which most of our migrants come.

* It came to power after promising extensive and expensive programs in almost every aspect of our affairs - health, education, social **security**, housing, urban development and protection of the environment.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* I know that the Minister for Social **Security** is most concerned about the overpayment of benefits to social welfare beneficiaries.

* My Government will continue its reconstruction of Australia's social **security** system.

* The next Budget will make further increases in social **security** and repatriation pension rates and take the next step in the abolition of the means test.

* The Government will appoint a judicial inquiry into the **security** services.

* At the same time it will continue to strengthen Australia's **security**.

* Resolution 341 1G (XXX) of 1975 requests 'that the **Security** Council call upon the Governments concerned to prohibit any of their institutions, agencies or companies, within their national jurisdiction, from delivering to South Africa or placing at its disposal any equipment or fissionable material or technology that will enable the racist regime of South Africa to acquire nuclear-weapon capability'.

* Resolution 32/105F of 1977 requested the **Security** Council to call upon all States 'to end all transfer of nuclear equipment or fissionable material or technology to South Africa'; and 'to prohibit companies, institutions or agencies within their jurisdiction from any cooperation with South Africa, directly or through participation in companies registered in South Africa, in its military build-up or nuclear development '. '

* No resolutions of the **Security** Council have been adopted which specifically apply to the question of the transfer of nuclear materials or technology between South Africa and member countries.

* **Security** Council resolution 418 of 4 November 1977, which was adopted unanimously decided however that 'all states will refrain from any cooperation with South Africa in the manufacture and development of nuclear weapons '.

* I am talking of a consolidated document that would show the kind of assistance that is available at the Australian Government level, the State government level, the local government level and now, as the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  foreshadows in his second reading speech, at the fourth tier of government which is rapidly being created in this country by the Australian Assistance Plan.

* It is a reflection on the previous Minister in charge of social **security**, the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth).

* Secondly, as I understand it, it is departmental policy to insist that programs for handicapped people be funded by the handicapped persons welfare section of the Department of Social **Security** and not through AAP funds.

* One such area, for example, concerns special schools for handicapped children that were built by voluntary associations with assistance from the Department of Social **Security**.

* This is anti-democratic legislation because it simply redefines and widens the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation 's powers to collect information regarding national **security**.

* I believe that these **security** organisations ultimately take on a life of their own and automatically identify their own interests with the national interest, which of course they see as the interests of conservative administration which supports their organisations' operation.

* Mr Chairman,  I draw your attention to the definitions of espionage, sabotage, subversion, **security** and so on, and I then move on to the amendment to clause 5.

* The very nature of the ASIO beast ensures that **security** will remain a matter of subjective definition.

* - Mr Chairman, with respect, what I am trying to show is that, if we are talking about the word 'ultimately' and what these facts will ultimately lead to, it is obvious that they will ultimately lead to a threat of subversion or a threat to **security**.

* That is why, during the late 1960s and early 1970s we had the spectacle of ASIO agents placing under surveillance people who marched in anti-Vietnam demonstrations- clergymen, academics and trade union leaders- because in their judgment those actions were ultimately bound to lead to threats against **security** and constituted subversion.

* In the absence of a specific approach from the Government of the Republic of Vietnam invoking the Treaty, the question of a report to the **Security** Council has not arisen.

* The Government believes that the NPT has made, and can continue to make, a substantial contribution to world-wide peace and **security**.

* In particular, we hope that the Conference will help make all states aware that the introduction of nuclear technology throughout the world must be accompanied by internationally accepted standards of physical and environmental **security** and by adequate assurances of peaceful use.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 27 April 1977: 
1 ) How many citizens in the Victorian municipalities of Broadmeadows, Coburg and Brunswick are esimated or known to be receiving (a) pensions and (b) other forms of social **security** benefits.

* So far as any **security** in any Government department is concerned, having looked at  Senator Murphy's  attitude towards the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, I believe that there is no **security** whatsoever.

* Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  whether he will ask the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to answer the 5 questions that I put to him in the debate last Thursday because he did not answer any of them.

* I have before me the leaflet of these benefits issued by the Department of Social **Security**.

* Let me quote a piece of limpid prose read by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in what we call a speech.

* But this Budget, concerned as it is with the high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national **security**, provides the essential framework for the attainment of these national goals.

* It is not based on the interests of the **security** of the country but it is based purely on a desire to economise and to reduce defence spending.

* Last year I wrote to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  seeking a review of the payments that are made.

* I understand that a submission has been made to the Minister for Social **Security** but to date nothing has happened.

* It washes its hands in the hope that the blame and the responsibility for this massive unemployment in Australia and the threat to job **security** will be shifted elsewhere.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 23 November 1978: 
1 ) Did the Department of Social **Security** publish in 1 978 a report, entitled 'A Place of Dignity', which reviews homeless persons assistance centres in Australia, and examines the operation of the Homeless Persons Assistance Act.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 8 October 1 978: 
How many of the Vietnamese who entered Australia without permits, but who were subsequently given temporary entry permits to regularise their immigration status while investigations continue, are now receiving (a) sickness, (b) unemployment and (c) any other social **security** benefit.

* Australia must be active to ensure stability and **security** in South East Asia.

* The **security** of Australia must be foremost in our minds.

* We could never enjoy any real **security** or even a sense of **security** if we turned  a  blind eye to the problems of South East Asia, to the aggressive and subversive policies of the Communist planners and nations, and especially to the recent activities of the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia.

* Australia could never enjoy real **security** if it turned a blind eye to the need to further the development of the industrial and economic growth of Australia.

* The Minister has confirmed that the Australian Government will continue to encourage the same responsible effort by the Asian and Pacific countries to develop their own resources for their own defence and regional cooperation towards collective **security**.

* We must be concerned to see that these new Russian activities are not detrimental to our own **security** and to the **security** of our region.

* Our **security** is no longer solely dependent on Europe.

* Such membership is vital to preserving the economic and political freedom and **security** of the independent states.

* The political stability and **security** of the area depend on their economic progress, know-how, development of natural resources and, in some cases, agriculture.

* The future **security** of the region depends largely on our success in this direction.

* Moreover, if we grow economically stronger we will generate a capacity to give economic and political **security** to the area.

* We should not be negative in our approach to achieve greater **security**.

* None of us on this side of the House have any objection whatsoever to the company's continuation in business and the preservation of the **security** of the people of Queenstown.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  is running around the country attacking those- 
I will be coming back to clause 6 of the Bill.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has denigrated the private health insurance organisations and claimed that they are inefficient.

* It is perhaps not irrelevant that the pretender to the title of Federal Treasurer, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  should be following me in this debate because, undoubtedly he will pursue a line which he knows is totally contrary to that which his more senior colleague the Treasurer holds.

* I challenge the Minister for Social **Security**, who is to follow me in this debate, to make clear to this House in a precise form which allows of no misrepresentation whether this Government is prepared to guarantee that the incomes power will be used along with the power to control prices.

* Fiscal instruments together with the social **security** system provide ample scope for the Government to achieve greater equity in distribution of income and wealth.

* As the Minister for Social **Security**, who I understand has studied economics knows all that this Government has been prepared to put down is an isolated ad hoc, fragmented and piecemeal approach to the problem of inflation in this country.

* The Minister for Social **Security** who, I hope, has a real sense of concern for equity in the Australian community, might tell in this debate, for the first time in the presentation of what the Government has been saying about inflation - what the facts are, we must be prepared to come clean with the facts.

* If the Minister for Social **Security** wants to make a real point about his capacity for economic understanding let him talk to this House about inflation as an imported phenomenon.

* It is the Government's firm view that joint Commonwealth and State involvement is the most effective way of promoting commercial certainty, of bringing about a reduction in business costs, of encouraging greater efficiency of the capital markets, and in maintaining investor confidence in the **security** markets through suitable provisions for investor protection.

* The question I have been wanting to ask for days is one that would be directed at the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* The question I have been seeking to ask him is: Is the Minister aware that the continuation of the present formula for determining the subsidy rate to be paid - 
In reply to the Social **Security** Minister,  Mr Hayden,  we the matrons, wish to declare that we are in fact not the spokesmen for the private enterprise nursing homes, but are speaking on.behalf of our patients.

* I reiterate my plea to the Minister for Social **Security** to discontinue his procrastination and his political vendetta against yet another form of private enterprise and to recognise that on this occasion it is not simply a matter of shareholders who are being affected but rather aged and sick people.

* The honourable gentleman spoke of the need for jobs as being a part of the environment in which people must live and of the need for **security**.

* Having **security** in a job and **security** for one's family are fundamental to what we are about.

* In doing so I congratulate the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  for the wonderful job that she has been doing in that position.

* In the four Budgets introduced by the Fraser Government it has significantly re-ordered priorities in the area of income, **security** and welfare.

* The Department of Social **Security** is being re-organised to ensure it is both more responsive to the needs of those dependent on its services and more responsible in the handling of community resources.

* Only this week the Minister for Social **Security** announced a grant of over $310,000 under the Aged Persons Homes Act to Southern Cross Homes Inc., to assist with the cost of purchasing land and constructing 22 self-contained units, known as Kavanagh Court, at 496 Main Street, Mordialloc, Victoria.

* - Senator Grimes, the shadow Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Australian Labor Party spokesman on social **security** matters,  Senator Grimes,  said: 
This is recorded in the Senate  Hansard  of 19 October 1978 at page 1471.

* I refer to two quotes from a paper by  Senator Grimes,  the ALP spokesman on social **security**.

* He stated: 
They are the words of the shadow Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Grimes.

* Most social **security** and benefit payments have reached record levels relative to average weekly earnings under the Fraser Government.

* This Government has given top priority to social **security** and the Fraser Government is to be complimented for the large percentage of the Budget expenditure which it commits to social **security**.

* The expenditure on social **security** programs administered this year will rise about 9.5 per cent from $7.1 billion in 1978-79 to $7.8 billion in 1979-80.

* Is it a fact that allegations of brutality against Aborigines by Territory police have been made by **security** officers in the Northern Territory.

* Were the **security** officers who made the allegations interviewed.

* Last Thursday week the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  introduced the Health Insurance Bill 1973, and we were advised at that time that the debate on it would ensue on the following Wednesday afternoon and Thursday - a day and a half in all.

* I would hate to see the honourable member for Hotham left in a state of wonderment about the Minister for Social **Security** over the Christmas recess.

* Yet, when officers of the Department of Social **Security** asked  Mr Moon  for copies of the report on which these figures were based they were informed that the report was not available, that he had not seen it and that, consequently, and naturally enough, there was no data on which his claims could be verified or examined.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 6 November 1979: 
Is the Minister able to state what percentage of annual budget appropriations are committed to Social **Security** and welfare outlays by national governments in (a) the United States of America, (b) the United Kingdom, (c) Canada, (d) Australia, (e) New Zealand, (0 Sweden, (g) Denmark, (h) the Netherlands, (j) France, (k) West Germany and (1) Japan.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation provided definitions of the meaning of subversion' to the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* If one also looks at the section of  Mr Justice  Hope's report as to trade unions one will see that it states: 
However, industrial disruption may affect **security**, and thus properly attract the attention of ASIO.

* These 'key points' are places the destruction of or damage to which would affect Australia 's defence and **security**.

* I again quote the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden.

* In the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 6 September 1972 he is reported as saying: 
I rise to speak to the Appropriation Bill and, in the time that is afforded me, I will confine my remarks specifically to the activities of the Department of Social **Security**.

* We are all aware of the millions of dollars that have been misused as a result of certain social **security** activities and of how the Government searches out those who abuse the system and thus decrease the benefits that could flow to others who are genuinely in need.

* It may not come before us; it may be vetoed by the **Security** Council, or any member of it, before it comes to the General Assembly, as the Leader of the Opposition will be aware.

* The question of entering into a reciprocal agreement on social **security** with the Maltese Government is being considered, lt is not possible to forecast the outcome of these considerations.

* The **security** to allow them to exercise that choice must be provided.

* It is our responsibility to ensure financial and psychological **security** for those women.

* If one takes the trouble to look at some of the speeches on the nature of the Bill generally it would be appreciated that the scheme of the legislation is to enable a **security** organisation to collect information.

* The implication is that if a file is kept on an individual he is known adversely to the **security** organisation.

* His  colleagues, who are now the Minister for Productivity  (Mr Macphee)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  both spoke eloquently of the need for a broad definition.

* We do this as a matter of principle wearing the full garb of a responsible Opposition because we sincerely believe that if these Bills are passed they will represent a disaster to the health of the Australian people, present and future.If sections of the pro-Labor Press want to label us as obstructionist and if the Labor apologists in this socalled Press gallery again want to accuse me of being non-progressive or of over-reacting in opposing this scheme, if the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  or his Leader want to repeat their threats about the dire consequences of our continued opposition, let them do it.

* I would suggest he might confer with his colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  who is reported as having an entirely different view on the state of the country.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Social **Security** chickened out on the challenge that we issued in this House in November.

* Social **Security**, the Minister for the Environment and Conservation and the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  and say that he is a socialist and declare where he stands on the question of private enterprise in the health care delivery system?

* The new second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security** revealed yet further dangers to the integrity of the medical profession.

* One day will be occupied in visiting the Task Force at Nui Dat; the other will be absorbed in interviews and briefings in Saigon, lt is incomprehensible that an adequate assessment could be made of the process of Vietnamisation or of the morale and **security** of Australian units in such a short visit.

* It provides an opportunity also to review the underlying philosophical issues which are involved in this Government's approach to social **security**.

* I want to focus my attention on the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden),  when he was Minister for Social **Security**, denned Labor's aims and commitments as follows:   .

* to the creation of a society which offers equality of opportunity, **security** and assistance to those who suffer from special disabilities ... we want to create a system of welfare services and benefits which is not class tainted and whose provisions are not stigmatised as charitable concessions to the deserving poor.

* At that time no other countries, with the exception of Greece and Japan, were spending less on public welfare, which included health, education and social **security** expenditures.

* What genuinely poor person would ever recognise the reality of his situation in the Budget Papers or in the estimates for the Department of Social **Security**?

* The Government is spending through a Social **Security** secret service nearly $7m to weed out the 'bludgers'.

* More likely the Social **Security** SS is there to endeavour to keep the spending on the meagre unemployment benefit below $ 100m extra.

* For the benefit of all honourable members, I point out that we are now back to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill after a  lapse of one month.

* One of the propositions that the Opposition has been most anxious to emphasise is a bipartisan attitude on **security**.

* If democracy is going to survive, it is essential in the **security** area that we have a bipartisan attitude and an understanding of what information is being obtained, against whom it is being obtained, and a guarantee that it will not be misused or abused.

* There could to no better guarantee for the people of Australia who are interested in the question of **security**, and it relates particularly to politicians themselves.

* The absence of express Parliamentary supervision is correlative to a bipartisan approach to **security** matters.

* If **security** is to be the subject of a partisan approach, the basis of what I have recommended about supervision goes.

* **Security** is literally concerned with **security**: with safety: with the survival of this country and, indeed, this globe'.

* If there is to be a bipartisan approach it is necessary that the opposition party or parties should be informed about **security** matters, and the appropriate way to do this is by consultation between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and by reports by the Director-General of **Security** to the Leader of the Opposition.

* We were discussing the proposed new clause 7A of the **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill.

* In the course of the interview with  Mr Carleton  I said: 
If our proposed new clause 7a is looked at rationally and reasonably on a bipartisan basis, it will be seen that it will not destroy **security** because the Leader of the Opposition will have to vouch for the validity of his interest in the matter.

* Senator Durack  finished that interview by saying: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
We have established new bodies to advise us and implement our policies.

* Other royal commissions are dealing with the maritime industry, land tenures, the petroleum industry, intelligence and **security**, Tasmanian transport costs and human relations.

* We have confirmed our implacable hostility to racialism in all its forms by our vote in the **Security** Council on South Africa's membership of the United Nations.

* Australia has continued to play her pan in enhancing global strategic, economic and social **security** and progress.

* The future **security** of Israel and her existence as a nation lie not in the occupation and proliferation of buffer zones but in the guarantees of the United Nations.

* The greatest danger for Israel is that insistence on a formal expression of her undoubted right to exist in **security** and in peace with her neighbours may some day lead to the destruction of her actual existence.

* The present United States Administration under  President  Carter has emphasised that while there may be temporary **security** lines or zones to which special **security** arrangements would apply in terms of a final settlement, the political borders in any settlement would necessitate 'Israels return to approximately the borders that existed prior to the war of 1967, albeit with minor modifications as negotiated among the parties'.

* The Labor Party has come into this House today and told us that there is something improper about the purchase of two 727 100s for the VIP fleet at a time when the whole world is entering a new era of **security** problems, at a time when studies show that, both for the protection of the Prime Minister and his party and, equally importantly, for the protection of those people who travel on commercial aircraft, it is much simpler if the Prime Ministers of the world today travel on separate aircraft.

* For example, Qantas has to go to enormous trouble to provide the required level of **security** for the Prime Minister both at points of take-off and at points of landing.

* When a Prime Minister has to travel on our own airlines and then join other airlines of the world, it is more difficult for those airlines to provide the levels of **security** which are required and deemed necessary, both for the Prime Minister and his party and for the travelling public.

* We have considered carefully what might be the best option to take in overcoming this terrific and horrific problem of **security** for the Prime Minister when he undertakes his very necessary trips.

* I do not think anybody in this country would be critical of that decision if he or she recognised and realised that we have to hand today reports on **security** which demand that we, as responsible members of parliament and Ministers of the Crown, provide for those VIPs who visit Australia and for our own Prime Minister when he leaves Australia a level of **security** which equates with the level of **security** provided to other Prime Ministers around the world.

* The whole world is demanding that VIPs be provided with proper **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-Last night during the adjournment debate two honourable members opposite spoke on two topics to which I wish to refer.

* The first matter was that of **security**, which was mentioned by both the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Holding).

* I can appreciate their concern at the fact that some form of **security** is being implemented at the Parliament because they might be prevented from entering this building at some stage.

* The honourable member for Wills said that there are enough attendants working in the building for us not to have to worry about **security**.

* Both honourable members completely overlooked the fact that the staff working in this building are just as important and need just as much **security** as honourable members.

* If the right honourable gentleman seeks to see the text of any document of this character I would give him permission to ask the Director-General of **Security** whether he can see it.

* But if the Leader of the Opposition - 
-I have not asked to see any ASIO **security** documents in my life.

* He laboured at great length the Department of Social **Security**.

* I do not want to spend too long in defence of the Department of Social **Security**.

* I am one who thinks that the Department of Social **Security**, on balance, works fairly efficiently under very great difficulties.

* There are many payments for which the Department of Social **Security** is responsible which do not show up in the Appropriation Bills under the Department of Social **Security**.

* Even allowing for that, the increase in outlays by the Department of Social **Security** and in staff numbers in the course of this financial year is very simply explained.

* If the honourable member cares to have a quick gloss through the appopriations and other sources he will find a substantial increase in the responsibilities of the Department of Social **Security**.

* It was during his period that there was considerable addition to the range of support schemes adopted by the Federal Government, particularly towards securing a higher level of **security** for Australian farmers through stabilisation measures, production incentives, through increased emphasis on rural research and extension, through strong representations by Australia in overseas forums seeking lower trade barriers for agricultural products, and greater stability on world commodity markets- trends which have continued until this day.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice:  (1)Is it a fact that the charge to patients for the cheapest beds in public hospitals in South Australia, such as the Royal Adelaide, is currently $20 per day.

* I think the difference between the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock),  the Government and the Opposition on this matter really comes back to an approach to the responsibilities- as supporters of the government see them- and the role of the **security** forces and our approach in balancing that role with the rights and liberties of Australian citizens.

* It is one of the functions of our intelligence and **security** forces to protect and enhance the rights and liberties of the Australian people.

* The honourable member for Dundas is perfectly happy to give these very wide powers to an intelligence and **security** operation.

* I do not think that the Director-General of **Security** ought to have imposed on him the power to act in all those situations which arise in the community and which can have incidental effects on the defence forces.

* Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* Might I say at the outset, without attempting to make a cheap political point, that I was very disappointed with the speech made by the honourable gentleman, who led for the Opposition and who is a former Minister for Social **Security** and a former Treasurer.

* If I were a pensioner listening to such a broadcast tonight it would not please me to know that my **security** or my future was being regarded as a political football by some politicians in this chamber in Canberra.

* But I support this legislation because an undertaking has been given by the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Newman)  in his second reading speech that this particular part of Liberal-Country Party policy has been delayed because the whole question of income **security** has been referred to an income **security** review committee headed, as I understand it, by the Prime Minister's Department.

* I have been further encouraged by noises that have been made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  that some of the recommendations of that committee, which I regard as being quite vital to the whole structure of social **security** in this country, will be implemented in the forthcoming Budget.

* I am encouraged also, as I said before, by the appointment of the income **security** review committee.

* We said that we would move towards, firstly: 
Providing emergency cash grants to cover urgent need through local offices of the Department of Social **Security**.

* The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the Act to be amended so that a mining authority to be issued under section 41 of the Act for mining at Ranger affords the persons on whom the authority has been conferred **security** of tenure .

* That is the main purpose of the legislation, and whilst one can understand that the Peko-EZ consortium is not prepared to make investments on the basis only of the memorandum of understanding or upon the whim and caprice of the incumbent Minister and that it seeks further **security** of tenure, it all points to the fact that the Atomic Energy Act is the wrong legislation for the Government to have used for the development of the Ranger project and the Northern Territory uranium province.

* That is obvious from the Minister's own statement, and I quote him again: 
The Ranger joint ventures have pointed out that section 41 of the Atomic Energy Act, as it presently stands, does not provide them with adequate **security** of tenure.

* Essentially, the Atomic Energy Act is a defence-oriented research Act and, because of that, it contains **security** measures which are not appropriate for a commercial mining operation.

* The whole concept of using the Atomic Energy Act should have been scrapped and we should have left it alone as a research Act, an Act governing a research institution, and established a commercial mining Act so that at least the work force and the people involved with uranium mining were not subject to the kinds of penal provisions and draconian **security** measures incorporated in the present Atomic Energy Act 
The point the honourable member is trying to make is that this is the normal thing under State rnining Acts, and that is so.

* Companies want **security** of tenure.

* They have been defined, firstly, as a means to achieve economic, industrial and social objectives and thereby the raising of living standards and the maintenance of job **security**.

* Surely job **security** should come first.

* 1 ) to ( 5 ) It has been the long standing practice of successive Australian Governments not to disclose matters relating to **security** intelligence.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said during the 1977 election campaign- a lot was said during that campaignthat she did not believe there was more abuse of unemployment benefits than any other category of social **security** benefits.

* In  2Vi  years the number of field officers in the Department of Social **Security** has gone up by 127.

* How cost-effective is it to put another 127 staff members into the Department of Social **Security**, at $15,000 each a year, to go around the country looking for people who are cheating on the system?

* Donald Woods was one of the many people in South Africa banned under the Internal **Security** Act, that legislation having as a predecessor the Supression of Communism Act.

* The Internal **Security** Act introduced in 1976 maintained and broadened the scope of the 1950 Suppression of Communism Act.

* It was first gazetted as the Protection of State **Security** Bill but renamed as the Internal **Security** Act because the proposed Bill could be abbreviated to the 'SS Bill' which had Nazi connotations.

* The Act created a 10-member parliamentary commission appointed by the Government to investigate matters referred to it by the government affecting internal **security**.

* Any policeman in the performance of his function of preserving 'the internal **security**' of South Africa may at any time without a warrant search any person or premises anywhere in South Africa and seize anything found on such person or in such premises.

* Banning orders now can be made under the Internal **Security** Act whereas previously they were under the Suppression of Communism Act 1950.

* Banning orders may now be imposed not only against communists or suspected communists but also against any person 'engaged in activities which endanger or are calculated to endanger  the **security** of the state or the maintenance of public order'.

* The so called lies which surrounded the activities of the **security** police in South Africa have at least been consistent over the years.

* In the inquest which was finally conducted in Pretoria, the South African **security** police chief stated that  Mr Biko-  I am now quoting from a report in the  Canberra Times  of 19 November 1977- tried to kill himself and was 'apparently set on selfdestruction' before his death in detention.

* Also reported in that newspaper was a version of what happened by  Colonel Pieter  Goosen, the head of the Port Elizabeth **security** police, whose version was challenged by Biko's family.

* He said in an affidavit which was read by Biko 's lawyer: 
I conclude by contrasting those words and the picture which was painted of the **security** police there with the words of Helen Suzman who has been a guest of this country and indeed of this House.

* She described Biko in the following terms: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* 1 ) to (4) Officers of the Departments of Health, Finance, Education, Aboriginal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Immigration, Ethnic Affairs and Social **Security** have met to ensure cooperative preliminary planning for the International Year of the Child.

* It is something which strikes a blow at the whole **security** of Australia.

* The damage that it is doing to the **security** of Australia will be remedied shortly by a change of government, and the United States and our other allies in the free world will know that once again Australia will have a government which represents the view of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people on this issue, which will not twist and determine Australia's foreign policy in the interests of the communist powers to the control of the left wing, that minority pro-communist control, which apparently is still so potent over the thinking of the Government when it comes to foreign poliCY 
If the Third or Fourth Division officers employed by the Department of Social **Security**, when the new scheme is introduced whereby unemployment benefits are to be paid fortnightly in arrears instead of fortnightly in advance, find that they are so inundated with work that they cannot carry out their duties and then try to make some protest against doing unreasonable amounts of overtime, they can be dealt with by this legislation in exactly the same way.

* I would take this opportunity to say that if any person has any doubt at all about the integrity or the **security** of any person on the staff of a Minister the decent thing, surely, is to let the Minister know.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has stated clearly and constantly in the Senate the Government's policy in regard to the payment of unemployment benefit.

* Not one press statement from the Leader of the Opposition or the Labor Party spokesman on social **security** or from honourable members opposite has done anything in regard to those questions.

* For the information of honourable members I present the report of the Joint Study of Emergency Relief entitled 'Emergency Relief- Study of Agencies and Clients', together with the text of a statement by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  concerning the report.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
It is very important that a qualification as proposed in new clause 23A as moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  be agreed to to make sure that, if the enormous powers of this section are in fact used, it must be on reasonable grounds.

* That case provides the best example that we know about the organisation and operation of **security** services in the Southwest Pacific.

* It is the Mount Everest of **security** work in the South Pacific; the tip of the iceberg.

* It provides the most clear cut evidence of how a **security** service works.

* There was a series of incidents in New Zealand during the period of the Labour Government, first of  Mr Kirk  and then of  Mr Rowling,  which involved **Security** Intelligence Service activity, carefully leaked to the then Opposition leader,  Mr Muldoon.

* The Labour Party is going against the **Security** Intelligence Service and is sabotaging the national interest'.

* I have no reason to assume that same type of activity as happened in the Sutch trial would not happen here in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and has not happened in the pastthat is, political harassment of a kind where it is very difficult to fight back.

* That is what one might assume to be the best example of the work being done by **security** services in New Zealand and Australia.

* Possibly it could have been argued that there was some justification for it in the days when we ceased paying social **security** benefits, for example old age pensions or invalid pensions, to our citizens or to people eligible for such payments when they went overseas.

* In a recent issue of a German newspaper in Australia there is a picture of German and American Ministers or Secretaries of State for social **security** signing an agreement which provides for the exchange of this sort of social **security** payment.

* If people contribute to social **security** payments, as happens in West Germany they are partly personal contributions and partly contributions from employers and they are entitled to receive those payments overseas then surely the fact that they accept Australian citizenship should not preclude them from receiving those payments.

* Mi YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (3.14)-This Government's withdrawal from the full employment commitment poses a threat to the job **security** of every working Australian.

* their job **security**.

* On the other, the effects of the micro-processor revolution threaten the job **security** of employees in banking, insurance and other clerical areas.

* Australia's tertiary industries provide 70 per cent of the employment in Australia, yet the Fraser Government totally refuses to acknowledge the threat to job **security** caused by the introduction of new technology.

* At this stage I wish simply to state that by making these adjustments automatically the Government has provided an element of **security** to the pensioner which has been lacking in the past.

* I have undertaken some preliminary examination of this matter and I have asked the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to look at the question.

* The  President  of the Australian Pensioners League in Western Australia was quoted recently in the Press as having said: 
What were the factors which lead to your choice of this time to make fundamental disclosures concerning Australian **security**?

* What were the factors which led to your choice of this time to make fundamental disclosures concerning Australian **security**?

* They were subsequent to and consequent upon his briefing of his own selected group of journalists to whom he disclosed national **security** information.

* It seems to be only a matter of time until the Labor Conference will tell the Government that in spite of our treaty commitments, our national **security** or any other interests the Government is not permitted to keep any troops in Singapore.

* The Labor Prime Minister of Australia has no control over the policy formulation even on matters of national **security** and he had to await instructions from the people who control the Labor Party.

* By virtue of that trust we have been given access to the **security** information of other governments.

* He breached all conventions of **security** conduct because, and only because, he wanted to escape the pressure of domestic political discomfort.

* Recently one grower who had a very good property and good **security** applied for assistance under the farm build-up scheme in order to purchase a neighbouring orchard.

* In an article in the  Social **Security** Bulletin  of May 1976 entitled 'Contrasts in HMO and FeeforService Performance', the finding is given that hospital use was significantly lower in group practice plans than in fee-for-service systems.

* The proportion of residents who will attract subsidy under the extended criteria is highly speculative, as I think the Minister  far  Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has admitted, but it is expected to rise by about half to aproximately 67i per cent.

* Homes will be required to make individual applications in respect of each hostel resident of under 80 years of age whom they consider to be in need of personal care attention, and registered geriatric or general nurses from the Department of Social **Security** will visit the homes at regular intervals to assist in classifying any of the borderline' cases.

* Visits to the homes by nurses attached to the Department of Social **Security** possibly will be made on a thrice yearly basis.

* Nurses from the Department of Social **Security** will be required on each visit to assess the condition of each resident on the list under 80 years of age and decide whether or not that resident is eligible for continued personal care and subsidy.

* The Department of Social **Security** is notorious for its liberality in looking at cases.

* I commend the Minister for Social **Security** on a speech which contained a great deal of humanitarian content with which the Liberal Party and, I am sure, the Country Party would agree.

* The Ministers referred specifically to the Department of Immigration, the Repatriation Department and Department of Social **Security**.

* am asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
With which countries does Australia have reciprocal agreements on social **security** (a) in force and (b) under negotiation.

* I take the viewand I believe many small '1' liberals would agree with me- that the act of marching by a citizen who wants to protest against a State government which says that he cannot march without a permit, is not the kind of political or social action which ought to attract the operation or the attention of **security** forces in order to prescribe that citizen as being involved in a possible act of subversion.

* If I have to choose as to the role and the responsibilities of our **security** organisations, I do not believe they ought to be wasting time collecting dossiers on people who are marching up streets in Brisbane and being grabbed by sturdy policemen.

* The point about all of those gentlemen is that they were not the type of people- they were too well bred; they were so much part of the establishment to attract the attention of the **security** organisation - 
I appreciate that; I am going to come to that.

* Not only were they part of the **security** organisation, but the **security** organisation, instead of worrying about Burgess, McLean and Philby, was probably trailing some trade union secretary to a meeting.

* The dilemma of this clause is that it imposes a responsibility on the Director-General which means that he does have seriously to consider whether he is going to waste the time and funds of his organisation by placing officers of **security** in buildings in Brisbane to take photographs of people who are exercising their democratic rights.

* Whether one likes street marches or not, that argument is really part of the ongoing democratic argument in our community and in my view ought to be excluded from **security** surveillance.

* I do not believe that those sorts of actions ought to be able to be placed within the context of subversion because I do not believe that they are subversion, and I do not believe that the DirectorGeneral ought to have to consider whether those actions constitute subversion, and they should not be taking up the time and the funds of our **security** organisation.

* I come back to the point that I made previously, that a narrow definition- and it will be slightly narrower if the amendment is carried- will not, in my view, seriously hamper for one moment the operations of our **security** organisation.

* I do not believe that we should be involving the Director-General of **Security** in situations where we give him a definition that is so broad, so wide that he finishes up having to involve himself and having to involve his service in what has been described as spook activities which are directed towards the legitimate rights, the ligitimate expression of view and the legitimate exercise of the civil liberties of the Australian people.

* I find it quite delightful to be able to sit back and see emerging from honourable members opposite the differences in attitudes towards the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* He believes that the **security** force ought to be subject of ministerial control absolutely.

* In other words, he believes that the **security** force ought to have the capacity to be the political force of the government of the day.

* If we read subclause 2, clearly, as it ought to be read, we will see that the scheme of the legislation is to give to the Director-General of **Security** the right to control the Organisation but subject to the general directions, not directions as to detail of the Minister.

* He raised the prospect of a political **security** organisation as Prime Minister  Mr Menzies  said: 
We saw  Mr Justice  Hope's recommendations as allowing too much room for limitation of the scope of ministerial power and responsibility, allowing too much residual authority to the Director-General.

* We regard the Government as having seized upon the correct principle in identifying those areas which should be left to the Director-General and not subjected to detailed ministerial direction by reference to **security** information relating to particular individuals.

* The amount allocated for the function of social **security** and welfare in 1965-66 was $933m.

* So the amount of Commonwealth Government outlays for the social **security** and welfare function was about 18 per cent of the total outlays.

* In the present financial year, under the last Labor administration, the amount allocated to the social **security** and welfare function is close to $5,000m.

* The figure for the social **security** and welfare function is approaching 25 per cent of total expenditure.

* So in 10 years the outlays on the social **security** and welfare function have risen from 18 per cent to an amount roughly equivalent to 25 per cent.

* If a government cuts down on our **security**, whether through disarming our defence forces or through undertaking an unwise foreign policy, the good things which we have and most of which we still have in spite of this Government can all be put at jeopardy.

* In those circumstances when armed aggression had occurred there was only one thing to do and that was to refer it to the **Security** Council and to the United Nations for appropriate determination.

* It was not because South Vietnam did not refer it to the **Security** Council.

* When  it found  that Communist China, which is on the **Security** Council with the power of veto, was going to exercise that power it wrote a pathetic  note  to the  President  of the **Security** Council.

* It states: 
That is, for the **Security** Council to intervene -  in the earnest hope that the **Security** Council would take a constructive approach to the problem and take adequate measures to remedy the situation.

* However, the permanent delegate of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations **Security** Council had subsequently issued a thoroughly negative statement, presenting a distorted version of the facts and clinging to the false claims of Chinese sovereighty over the Hoang-Sa (Paracels) and Truong-Sa (Spratley) archipelagoes.

* Since the People's Republic of China is apermanent member of the **Security** Council and has veto power, this leaves little hope for any constructiva debate or positive action.

* Therefore, I wish to inform you that all my communications to the **Security** Council are for the purpose of drawing the attention of the Council to the grave situation existing in the South-East Asia region as a result of China's encroachment on the Republic of Vietnam's territory.

* It belongs to the **Security** Council and its members to fulfil their responsibilities and to decide on what is to be done to correct that situation.

* That is an appeal for the **Security** Council to take action.

* Australia has a representative on that **Security** Council but we did nothing.

* Why did we not refer the matter to the **Security** Council and make certain that it was discussed by the **Security** Council?

* If the bullies in Communist China want to use their veto on the **Security** Council to paralyse the **Security** Council, at least let them be exposed for what they are.

* If the United Nations is powerless to resolve the dispute over the Paracels, do honourable members think it is in a position to offer **security** to Australia?

* The Government has an Australian representative on the **Security** Council in New York but he received  in,  instructions to act.

* What we are thinking of at the present moment is that if this Government is allowed to remain in office and to persist in its present courses, the **security** of the Australian people is vastly endangered.

* He is more concerned with the **security** of his own Government than he is concerned with the **security** of Australia.

* Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* What is more important they are issues affecting the financial **security**, the contentment and the daily lives of our people, and generations who may follow them.

* There should be public awareness because the public has been lulled into a false sense of **security**.

* Less will have to be spent on education but more on the social **security** system.

* What amounts are 'reasonable' will depend on how much is required to provide pensions arid social **security**, payments which, firstly, are livable at a level of dignity which mirrors contemporary Australian standards and, secondly, are maintained, at that level automatically, that is, without the need for political gestures, much less charity.

* Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in his second reading speech, that depending on the rate of increase in average weekly earnings, annual adjustments of $3 to the pension may well prove inadequate.

* Does it mean that we will not be able to honour the pledge of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  not to increase taxation, or that other urgent priorities will have to be sacrificed to meet those of social **security**?

* To illustrate my further comments in this respect I seek leave to incorporate a table comparing direct and indirect tax, and social **security** contributions expressed as percentages of gross domestic product in selected countries for 1969, those being the lastest figures available.

* But this really tells only part of the story because it fails to acknowledge the important contrast between the important role of social **security** contributions elsewhere as against their total absence here.

* This is well summarised in the table which shows a social **security** contribution of nil for Australia as against 5 per cent for the United Kingdom, 5.8 per cent for the United States of America and rising as high as 10.8 per cent for Germany, 14.5 per cent for The Netherlands and 14.6 per cent for France.

* The sum of taxation plus social **security** contributions leaves Australia far behind all the rest.

* The difference in these figures reflects the extent to which our own social **security** system has been allowed to fall behind progressive world standards.

* To do so would be to place at risk its people's future **security** and prosperity.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security** aware that the maximum amount which pensioners are able to earn while still retaining full eligibility for pension entitlements was fixed at $20 a week in September 1972 and has not been increased since then despite massive levels of wage inflation in the last  Vh  years?

* I would suggest to the Minister that the Government might examine the need for better **security** for second mortgages on war service homes.

* Under the Act a serviceman virtually has no **security** and it is extremely difficult for a man, unless he has the full amount of the deposit, which can be considerable with a loan of  $9,000,  to be able to get a second mortgage.

* I suppose that nothing is of very much significance if the **security** of our people is abandoned.

* Apart from that, one must consider the **security** of this country.

* As far as I am concerned, we should accept the **security** of agreements and friendship with Indonesia.

* The only other thing I add is that in matters of surveillance no one is more aware of the dangers that can occur not only to the morality of this nation but also to the **security** of this nation by the constant bringing in of drugs and so on than we people who live in the frontier areas.

* The honourable member referred to **security** clearances for members of ministerial staffs.

* Nobody ever asked anybody who put on his infantryman's uniform during the last war for a **security** clearance.

* Nobody will ask anybody on my staff for a **security** clearance either.

* 1 believe it is a continuing insult to the whole community to suggest that any group of people needs **security** clearances.

* From overseas experience, as well as from our own history, we know that to alter this important aspect of Australian community life poses a very real threat to the **security** of the Australian people, especially of the Australian working man.

* Perhaps it is personified by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  who are keen on an enlargement of the public sector, and maybe the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  as the high priest of high wages, shorter hours and longer holidays, in pursuit of the other objective.

* Was he referring to the priorities of the Minister for Social **Security** for public sector spending or of the Minister for Labour for the private sphere?

* I recall a speech some months ago by the Minister for Social **Security** who said this straight out..

* First it has the power to regulate trading bank liquidity by means of the statutory reserve deposit and the liquids and government **security** reserves convention; secondly, the supervision and limitation of savings bank assets portfolios; thirdly, controls over bank lending as to both volume and general direction; fourthly, bank interest rate policy; fifthly, the capacity to engage in open market transactions in financial assets and thereby to influence not only bank liquidity but money market conditions generally.

* By far the greatest and most consistent **security** held is that of Commonwealth bonds.

* Any Government **security**, which I note will be fully endorsed by the Federal Government, which has called for subscriptions at .41 per cent over the Commonwealth rate must in itself be a success.

* They had lost their jobs and they were receiving social **security** benefits.

* What I said in my statement, made on 22 August, was that at the present time it can be said that Australia's situation is favourable and that the various important factors and trends in the international situation support Australia's **security** into the longer term.

* We and our advisers at the present time do not foresee any deterioration in our strategic environment that would involve consideration of the commitment of our forces to military operations to protect Australia's **security** or strategic interests.

* I pointed out that this view of Australia's long term **security** was the view accepted by the previous Government in recent years.

* So the forces must at any time be capable of expansion to meet any threat to our **security** within the time that it would take for such a threat to develop.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 7 November 1978: 
What are the details of the sum and disposition of funds from the Office of Child Care,Department of Social **Security**, for Children's Services Development Officers during 
How is it possible for any person adversely affected or believing himself - or in the case of a company, itself - to be adversely affected by the operation of any restrictive agreement if he cannot have, on reasonable terms and after proper **security** measures have been taken, access to it to examine its contents?

* The number of buildings in each State not owned by the Commonwealth but occupied by the Department of Social **Security** and authorities under the control of the Minister for Social **Security** is as follows: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
This Bill more than honours the Government's commitment to provide bi-annual increases of at least $1.50 per week in the basic pension rate until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* I mention at this stage how much I appreciate the co-operation of the Opposition, and in particular the spokesman for the Opposition in matters of social **security**, who has agreed that the Bill should be introduced tonight and should proceed through this House into the Senate.

* Searching inquiries into various aspects of our social **security** programs and allied fields are currently being undertaken by a number of expert bodies set up by the Government for the purpose.

* Our view, and that of our predecessors in office, was that a couple who live together in this way are, in effect, married, and they are treated accordingly by the Department of Social **Security**.

* The fact is that there is a fairly stringent work test applied by both the Department of Labour and the Department of Social **Security** to ensure eligibility for unemployment benefits.

* All of these points have been detailed in that sample survey which has been submitted to the poverty inquiry and I repeat that I hope that very soon I can release that report so that we can kill some of this most obnoxious, unfair and in too many cases thoroughly dishonest misrepresentation which has been broadcast in the community in an effort to discredit the development of a comprehensive system of social **security** benefits and social welfare services which are based on a truly liberal philosophy in which the dignity of the individual is respected and his right to self-realisation and achievement in society is fostered in every reasonable sort of way.

* I am sure that all honourable members will consider this expenditure well justified in terms of the manifest improvements in social **security** introduced by this Bill.

* The sequence of events that led to the raid by the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  on the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation and the near hysteria caused by the heaviest **security** measures ever taken to protect the communist Yugoslav Prime Minister whilst in Australia and the subsequent events are worth recalling in this Parliament on this the last day of this extraordinary session.

* Now we come to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, which has always been the target for attack by the Australian Labor Party's left wing socialists.

* Only 2 years ago the left wing failed by one vote to have the **security** organisation dismantled in terms of the Australian Labor Party's policy.

* Did the Attorney-General raid the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to satisfy the left wing policy objective?

* Did he raid the **Security** Intelligence Organisation to discredit it?

* I would not have any suspicions about the Minister because he is a right wing Labor man, but how many Ministers in the Government have refused to have their staffs **security** cleared?

* So the whole blame was left to reside with the **Security** Intelligence Organisation, the suggestion being that it is incompetent.

* The point that seriously concerns the liquidator and those who were responsible for the rescue operation - it certainly concerns the ordinary shareholders - is that preferential **security** has been given and was demanded by some of the major creditors of the company.

* The newspaper contains a reported conversation between  Mr Van  Toll, a member of the Ord-BT group, and a  Mr Todner  in these terms: 
Van Toll:  'When did you get your **security**?'

* Van Toll:  'I think that might be the sort of **security** you could paper your walls with.'

* Those sitting on good **security** naturally will want to keep it but at the best it would appear that no more than an equitable charge has been created in respect of the majority of shares held.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  in his second reading speech felt obliged to comment on the intermittent criticism which we hear in relation to the rate of increase of the married pensioner rate not equalling that of the standard pension and, accordingly, the married rate not equalling 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings.

* Secondly and more uncomfortably, the sheer scale of the finance involved again serves to remind us that social **security** accounts for such a large proportion of Commonwealth expenditure and the growth of social welfare expenditure represents such a large proportion of growth overall that it is impossible to ignore social welfare as an aspect of the more general economic debate in which the Parliament is involved.

* A couple of weeks ago, in the last cycle of sittings, I asked the Minister for Social **Security** a question about nursing homes.

* Again this is not being strictly relevant to the Bill before us, so I do not develop it further now; but I raise it as a second area where, irrespective of any desire for restraint in Government spending, additional and not less Government expenditure in the area of social **security** will be called for.

* The consideration that arises in the current economic framework is this: If the growth of expenditure overall is to be reduced, social **security** payments must play some part in the process, if only because social **security** payments are such a large proportion of the whole.

* One or other of those simply has to suffer if social **security** is to play any part in this process of restraint in the growth of Government expenditure.

* That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.'

* As the Prime Minister indicated to the House in his speech on 25 October last year the Government had decided to accept the basic judgments of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* One of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security** was: 
That it operates within the terms of its statute and is concerned only with matters relevant to **security**.

* And that it observes standards of propriety by not intruding on the rights and freedom of persons except to the extent that the requirements of the nation's **security** justify, and the law allows.

* The Government has directed the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to comply with these recommendations.

* Moreover, if a citizen should surfer injury from an illegal activity of the **security** service, he could obtain redress in the ordinary courts.

* Commonwealth employees and persons in certain 'immigration' categories will be able to have ASIO's **security** assessment of them subject to independent review by the new **Security** Appeals Tribunal.

* Mr Justice  Hope found that without adequate machinery for review of **security** assessments of persons .

* (Second Report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**, AGPS 1977; para.

* The establishment of the new Tribunal will rectify this and will therefore function as a major civil liberties safeguard in relation to ASIO's **security** assessments.

* It is anticipated that the legislation bringing into effect the changes to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, including the establishment of this Tribunal, will be introduced during the forthcoming Budget sittings.

* In the social **security** and welfare field the Government has responded to the needs and the very legitimate aspirations of all pensioners.

* I of course recognise that there was a lower proportion subscribed by the banks but with regard to subscriptions for particular stocks, I mention for the information of the House that the 1978 stock attracted 47 per cent of subscriptions; the 1981 **security** 24 per cent; the 1987 **security** 17 percent; and the 1999 **security** attracted 12 per cent.

* I maintain that its main intent is to give a boost to confidence and a new optimism for expansion, development, reduced unemployment and economic **security** for all our people.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  now realises his mistake because the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  had to tell him yesterday that he has been making a virtue of cutting back on staff.

* However, the family has been stripped and is still being stripped of many of its functions- its responsibility for the education of young children; its responsibility to provide the socialising experience for young children; its role in the past as a productive unit; its functions and responsibility to be the unit that conveys social values to young children; and its responsibility to provide to its members some measure of economic **security**.

* Wages, taxation, education, employment, social **security** and many other policies are and should be used, in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 'to protect the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society'.

* As the criteria used for determining wages no longer takes account- nor should they- of the needs of those wage earners supporting families, we must look to the tax structure and the social **security** system to recognise the needs of families.

* Along with social **security**, pensions, benefits and allowances, the tax structure forms part of the welfare transfer system.

* Fair social **security** and tax systems will enable those women who feel forced to work to stay at home.

* Honourable members opposite will be able to laugh from the **security** of their pensions after the next elections.

* To what part of the **security** service does he belong?

* It seems that perhaps the **security** of Australian troops going to Namibia may not be as effective as it ought to be.

* Until the United Nations intervened, it was the venue, as was the Union of South Africa more generally, of the most odious, racist and repressive **security** laws- apartheid- of anywhere in the world.

* We need reassurance on the **security** of Australian military personnel who will be sent to that country as part of the United Nations' undertaking there.

* Another decision that has been made is to have Australia elected to the United Nations **Security** Council.

* The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  has proudly announced that the Soviet Union will support our election to the **Security** Council.

* We are doing everything we possibly can and are coming to secret agreement with the Soviet Union so as to get the 3 Soviet votes - as honourable members know, the Soviet Union has 3 votes - necessary to enable Australia to be elected to the **Security** Council.

* It has been alleged that for the next few months - until the vote for the **Security** Council is taken - the Soviet Union should not be antagonised and that the Department of Foreign Affairs has told the Department of Immigration that it should not be sympathetic to people whom the Soviet Union wants to exclude from membership of any outside nation - people whom it wants to get back into its own clutches.

* I am happy about supporting the right of people to be out of the Soviet Union and in Australia, but we should not be giving them misinformation and pretending we support them while at the same time remaining silent in places where what is said really counts - in the United Nations - and making general statements simply to get support from the Soviet Union on an issue that is not really terribly important to Australia, namely, whether Australia is to be a member of the **Security** Council next year.

* One does not have a great deal of difficulty finding the words in terms of what this Government has said and what its spokesmen have said from the very beginning when the Liberal and National Country Parties went to the election of 1975 through to the Budget that we have just seen passed and even now after the Budget we have the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  saying quite clearly that the Government's commitment to the indexation of pensions was unconditional.

* She said in the Senate: 
Well everybody goes down to the shops to buy goods over the counter and what it means is from next May pensioners, single pensioners, will have about $2.30 less in the pay packet which they should have, and when you go down to buy your goods you have got to have the money, and the thing is, the married couples about $3.80 a week, that's what they're losing by the scrapping of the twice yearly pension increases and that's a considerable amount of money and ... at least 90 per cent of all aged, invalid, widows and supporting parents, even though they may have some other income, depend on social **security** cash benefits for survival and that's the nitty gritty of the whole thing.

* Government's economic strategy begins seriously to affect its capacity to maintain active programs which will guarantee the **security** of people dependent on Government assistance.

* It will mean significant savings for the majority of Australians, and for those who are the victims of tragic accident or misfortune it will bring a measure of justice and **security** which has never been possible under the law as it stands.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  stated on 1 5 July last year: 
There is no dispute about the cost of accidents to society in human and economic terms.

* Depending on where, when and how an injury occurs, a victim may have an action for damages at common law, or be entitled to workers' compensation, or be entitled to no-fault motor accident benefits if he is injured in Victoria or Tasmania, or come within the scope of a criminal injuries compensation scheme, or be eligible for social **security** payments.

* Thus severely injured victims, whose need for economic **security** is greater because of the long term nature of their incapacity, are obliged to wait until medical opinion is final before their claim is settled.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has just supplied me with official figures which show vividly the waste and extravagance built in to the existing system.

* Moreover, the payments amounting to between $ 100m and $ 1 50m which are at present made by way of voluntary insurance, social **security**, repatriation, sick leave and superannuation would be unnecessary under the scheme proposed by the Bill.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* The Department of Social **Security** does not keep separate statistics 07 this group of people and it therefore not known how many of these people are currently in receipt of a benefit from that Department 
Why should a monolithic health service be any different, any better, for the people of Australia than the one which has been developed as part of the Australian need?

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  referred to the Government's scheme as a superior economic system.

* This scheme has been explored by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  by the shadow minister for social **security** in our Party and by other speakers.

* In 1972 the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  said: 'We would, in fact, build good quality nursing homes at various points in the community according to various types of plans'.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: 
1 ) What sum was spent by the Department of Social **Security** on advertising and services during the period (a) 1 1 November 1975 to 13 December 1975, (b) 14 December 1975 to 30 June 1976, (c) 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1977 and (d)l July 1977 to date.

* If this link is imperilled the **security** of Australia and India would be put at issue.

* Marcos warns that a Soviet entrenchment in Indo-China could imperil the **security** of small South East Asian nations.

* In summary, clause 8 provides that the Minister is not empowered to override the opinion of the Director-General on whether the collection of intelligence by the Organisation concerning a particular individual would or would not be justified by reason of its relevance to **security**, on the question of whether the communication of intelligence concerning a particular individual would be for a purpose relevant to **security** or concerning the nature of the advice that should be given by the organisation to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth.

* The Government is very silly and very trite if it believes that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation, despite its antidemocratic track record, is going to be a better judge of national **security** and the people's democratic rights than those who have been elected to serve the national interest.

* Is it true that ASIO would be able to release information- against the advice of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Government- to overseas intelligence agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency or the Bureau of State **Security** or any other national intelligence agency overseas?

* In the case of clause 26- all of this is relevant to clause 8 and the way in which the Organisation collects its information- the Minister may authorise the use of listening devices if he is satisfied that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation might be listening to a person engaged in or reasonably suspected of being likely to engage in activities prejudicial to **security**.

* In the case of clause 27 mail and telegrams can be inspected if it is suspected that they will be received by a person reasonably suspected of being likely to engage in activities prejudicial to **security**.

* One notes the use of sheer cloudy generalities such as 'preparation for domestic subversion' likely to engage in activities prejudicial to **security**' and 'reasonably suspected of being engaged in'.

* If honourable members look at the Hope report, on which this Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Amendment Bill was supposed to have been based, they will see that  Mr Justice  Hope contradicts himself.

* The fourth report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**, volume I at page 181, paragraph 373, states: 
The Director-General needs, and should have, guidance and indeed direction from those who are in a position to give it.

* But, regardless of resources, it is a problem inherent in the nature of national **security** functions.

* The nature of these problems and of the issues involved strongly support the view taken in the past that general **security** policy is a matter for the Prime Minister.

* Therefore, I do not believe that there has been any breach of **security** in this article.

* When they are accredited they are given guidelines and told that if there is any breach of **security** by them or if they conduct activities on the.

* But I have taken the opportunity of ensuring that all correspondents in the Australian' Task Force area are reminded of the fact that should there be any breach of **security** on their part their accreditation will be immediately withdrawn.

* It must be clearly understood that many women prefer the **security** of a pension to the tremendous uncertainty of maintenance payments from a spouse.

* In my view it will contribute to the dignity and **security** of life in Australia and give needed assurance to the children of the participants of the marriage that has failed.

* December 1972 to see that the people of this country are given the **security** to which they are entitled.

* How do we interpret **security**?

* It is not just in terms of health **security**, as we have done with Medibank; it is not just in terms of social **security** benefits that give the people some sort of additional **security** above that which was not provided in the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Government.

* The Minister may recall that the first question directed to him in this House on his assumption of the portfolio of Supply some time ago was asked by me about **security** at Woomera.

* Was it because the Government was fearful that the confidence of the United States of America and of other countries using Woomera would be undermined insofar as **security** arrangements in this country are concerned?

* Was the **security** scandal at Woomera in fact a political trick on the part of the Government that misfired?

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The figures are there.

* We are opening new areas in the social **security** field which require people to work in them.

* If anything, most of the people in my area complain that there is not enough service in the government departments and that they cannot get served in the Department of Social **Security** offices because there is not enough staff and there are too many queues.

* There is a big program in the areas of urban development and urban transport and, as I mentioned earlier, in social **security** and in the field of recreation.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 March 1978: 
1 ) What amounts of travel and subsistence expenditure of the Department of Social **Security** were spent on (a) overseas and (b) domestic travel during 1 976-77.

* My Government  rededicates  itself to govern for all Australians and to work in partnership with all groups to build an Australia in which its people can have **security**, the knowledge that they can plan ahead with assurance, and that their efforts will be rewarded.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
It is estimated that the annual cost of increasing the rent allowance (supplementary assistance) for social **security** pensioners from $5 to $ 10 a week would be some $8Sm.

* The policy of full employment is the Government's positive contribution to the **security** of the individual.

* Full employment spells  opportunity  and opportunity opens the way for achievement At the same time the Government recognises that this needs to be supplemented by social **security** measures which protect the less  fortunate  from hardship and supplement the standards of thing of those in greatest need.

* In the House today the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  claimed that he had not seen a minute circulated at Lucas Heights which claimed that **security** had been tightened up because of an alleged threat by Japanese anti-nuclear activists.

* What arrangements have been made for the **security** clearing of members of ministerial staffs?

* Will he assure  the House that all staff who have access to Cabinet papers and official files will undergo the same **security** clearance procedures as apply to other members of the Public Service?

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: 
The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said that this matter was raised as an exercise to look at the disposition of our present forces.

* It literally amazes me that the Opposition, which regards itself as the alternative government should be so insensitive to the needs of **security**.

* **Security** is essential in a military operation of this kind, and it is even more essential when we are in a situation of withdrawal from an area in which, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has said, enemy units are still operating.

* These plans take into account the parallel planning by the South Vietnamese authorities for the redeployment of Vietnamese forces as appropriate in order that the South Vietnamese forces may assume in the very near future full operational responsibility for the **security** of Phuoc Tuy Province.

* But the extraordinary thing is that the Opposition does not seem to realise this need for **security**.

* As I said at the time, I have no intention of breaking **security**.

* We have seen constant attempts by the Opposition to try to breach **security** in a way which does not help it.

* One could go on and mention the attempts to break **security** at Pine Gap and the moves to abolish national service.

* I ask: Is this going to help the **security** of Australia?

* So the Commander followed a reasonable and prudent course to ensure the **security** of his force and the **security** of the Province.

* But very soon the responsibility for the **security** of this area will pass to the South Vietnamese.

* They are leaving behind a province in which physical **security** has been greatly improved.

* I repeat that the telex, or reported telex, must clearly be a document from the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I learned how easily these relationships can be upset, how easily the quality of health care can decline if one wields the bludgeon, as the present Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  has done; if one attempts to let funding arrangements and economic considerations rather than efficient and sympathetic delivery of health care predominate in the health scheme; if in a search for something that is simple and easily understood one forgets that he is dealing with something that is essentially complex and therefore not conducive to such treatment; if one pulls down and destroys and starts again rather than build on what is proven and tried.

* This should hardly be necessary except that over many years now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Social **Security** have persistently and wilfully misled the public, and in this they have been uncritically echoed by some newspapers, particularly the Melbourne 'Age'.

* Last year the Government brought down a White Paper designed to turn away wrath, to assuage fears, to dampen down the hostility of people and institutions affected by its proposals, and to lull people into a sense of false **security**- a dishonest document deliberately designed to mislead.

* Why have the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** denigrated them time after time, year after year, week in and week out?

* Faced with this position, with the ground cut from under their feet, the present Prime Minister and the present Minister for Social **Security** decided to bluff it out, to misrepresent and misrepresent everything about the defects of the present scheme and the elements of their own scheme.

* I defy both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social **Security** to deny that at the time they said those things they knew them to be untrue.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  says there is structural unemployment in the country.

* How much greater **security** will it supply?

* However following adoption of U.N. **Security** Council Resolution 253 of 1968 action was taken by Qantas officers to comply with the terms of the resolution.

* The Governor-General's Speech included pious statements about 'choice' and 'freedom'; about 'expanding job opportunities'; about the 'independence and self-respect' of the growing body of people now dependent on social **security** because the economic masters- both in government and in the corporate sector- cannot and will not operate the economy in a way that will provide jobs and preserve the living standards of the work force of this country.

* The Federal Government can extend this cover of **security** in a number of ways and for very cogent reasons.

* We ought to examine why governments not only in this country but throughout the would in recent years have been literally forced to take both legislative action and direct involvement to give the community the **security** that it needs.

* The proposed corporation will ensure the rights of policy holders, in that their guarantee, **security** and protection will be assured, and that is a lot more than a high proportion of companies in the insurance industry have done over the last 5 years.

* It has a long way to go yet before policy holders will get anywhere near the **security** they deserve.

* I support the Bill in the firm belief that this measure will give the community the coverage and **security** to which it is entitled.

* and (2) At April 1973 approximately 61 per cent of men aged 65 years and over and approximately 74 per cent of women aged 60 years and over who were qualified by residence for an age pension were in receipt of a pension from the Department of Social **Security**.

* Our minds go back to an incident in 1973 when the present Leader of the Opposition was serving the Parliament in his capacity as Minister for Social **Security**.

* It came to our attention that the Department of Social **Security** was in the course of considering the purchasing of computer equipment to serve what subsequently turned out to be the Medibank system.

* Yet it transpired that officers of the Department of Social **Security** had gone on a mission to Canada to look at IBM computer equipment that was used in Canada's health scheme.

* One might well ask the question: Why was a mission going from the Department of Social **Security** to look at IBM computer equipment in Canada, given the fact that our system was not to be based on the Canadian system?

* The honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street),  a very alert member of the Opposition at the time, representing the interests of the country and the taxpayer, had the audacity to ask a question of the Leader of the Opposition who was at the time Minister for Social **Security**.

* He dared to challenge the then Minister for Social **Security** to explain to the Parliament firstly why officials had gone to Canada to study the Canadian system when the Parliament had been advised that the Australian Government was not going to adopt the Canadian system and, secondly, why representatives of IBM were accompanying those officials on the mission.

* It has to be stressed- I say it now unequivocally- that this order was placed on the specific authority of the then Minister for Social **Security**.

* Notes with grave concern that during the term the present Leader of the Opposition served as Minister for Social **Security**: 
This Government is keeping the situation constantly under review.

* What can be taken by the Australian public as a firm guarantee from this Government is that it will discharge all the pledges in relation to social **security** benefits, as they are now called, which it made in the last policy statement.

* The systems of social **security** benefits and health and welfare services will be vastly improved as the Government explores new horizons for the benefit of the community.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 16 October 1979: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
National power carries with it national responsibilities.

* In respect of the securities industry, it has been said that there are not six **security** markets in Australia, one for each State: There is one national market.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Payments in 1976-77 by the Department of Social **Security** were: 
-I realise that we are in a hurry.

* I refer to the transfer of control of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation to the office of Prime Minister.

* To deal with my second point, I refer to clause 5 of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill, which provides: 
On the visit abroad referred to by the honourable member I was accompanied for part or all of the visit, by  Mrs Fraser,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs and a member of his private staff, eight officers from various departments and eleven members of private staff, a consultant physician and three **security** officers.

* On the first flight referred to by the honourable member I was accompanied by  Mrs Fraser,  three members of private staff, the consultant physician and two **security** officers.

* On the second flight referred to by the honourable member I was accompanied by  Mrs Fraser,  four members of private staff, the consultant physician and two **security** officers.

* -Clause 8 of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill has become in effect one of the most important clauses of the Bill primarily because of the failure of the Government to provide other forms of control over the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I fear that in clause 8 the Government has been too fearful of that abuse and has rather neglected the other great danger of **security** organisations or such organisations as ASIO.

* Yet when we look at the legislation that governs the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation we say that it:  shall be an offence for officers of that Force to disclose information except in circumstances defined by Parliament.

* None of us who believe and endeavour to comply with the laws of the land should be concerned that our names may happen to come on to information collected by police forces, **security** organisations and customs authorities because, of necessity, we cannot tell when we park our car in a particular street, when we walk down a particular street or go to a particular meeting whether we are in an area or a place that the law enforcement authorities have under surveillance because they suspect that someone else may be there.

* National **Security** (War Damage to Property) Regulations, r. 59 
National **Security** (Industrial Property) Regulations, r. 5 
Having spoken in general terms, I want to direct the attention of the House to what I regard as a quite significant gap in this legislation.

* A law enforcing authority of the Commonwealth like the law enforcing authorities of the States has a critical role to play in the general **security** of this nation and should gather and pass on information that relates to the nation's **security**.

* If it is to be the case that the Australian Federal Police are to have a special branch, why is it that we impose upon Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation officers a strict code of behaviour and make it an offence for them to disclose information about any person who is on their files.

* A person who in no way is a **security** risk and about whom there is no concern from a **security** point of view could find that, because of association, his name may quite properly have found its way on to a **security** file.

* What begins as irrelevant information can, in due course of time, for some people become quite relevant information in a **security** context.

* Included in that course of action is the reference- in the context of the reference by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (  Mr Fife)  to the Law Reform Commission of this whole question- of the way in which information gathered by Commonwealth Government instrumentalities can be used contrary to the intentions of this Parliament and in a manner which is designed to abuse free citizens about whom the police force, either in a **security** sense or a general police sense, has no concern.

* My question is to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* It is shameful that these people are not given the **security** of mind of knowing that their often limited incomes will not be called on to meet the costs associated with their disability.

* I, along with the people of Australia and other members of the Opposition have been amazed at the blatant advertising concerning Medibank which has been undertaken by the Minister for Social **Security** and the Government in all our national newspapers.

* If the health insurance scheme is as efficient as the scheme under which the Department of Social **Security** is paying unemployment benefits, it will soon be christened 'Muddlybank'.

* I point out to the honourable member for Kingston that if he had read the second reading speech made by the Minister for Social **Security** he would know that the Minister said: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The Australian Government Weekly Digest Vol.

* 4 page 1 13 reported that the then Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Bill  Hayden, had announced a pilot program of grants to Community Information Centres.

* Further details can be supplied by the Minister for Social **Security**.

* the extent to which Australia becomes a mere puppet in vital matters of defence and **security**, told only what we are permitted to be told rather than what we are entitled to be told.

* The Department of Defence maintains such stringent **security** that it excludes the Minister from access to information too.

* This expansion took Pine Gap into new areas, enabling it to control a wider range of intelligence satellites- both Central Intelligence Agency and National **Security** Agency- and making Pine Gap the most important intelligence station outside the United States.

* Also, at some time in the late 1960s, North West Cape became host to an operation of the Naval **Security** Group- NSG- the largest component of the National **Security** Organisation, NSA, which is the super-secret American electronic intelligence organisation.

* I mention such things as the extra funds to be paid in health benefits, to nursing homes, in social **security** payments and for education.

* That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to **security** in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond bis control.'

* The growers have borrowed this at a 10, 1 1 or 12 per cent rate of interest against the **security** of the clip and the levies on the chp.

* From the time of the inception of this service some $365,000, or an amount in excess of that, has been made available mainly through my Department but also with inputs from the Department of Social **Security** and the Department of Health.

* Last year the Government undertook  a  review of the income tax law on convertible borrowings with the objective of restoring tax deductions for interest in a way which would not provide the means of exploiting the conversion technique for tax saving purposes so commonly used before 1960, but would allow companies to use convertible securities where that class of **security** met the needs of borrowers and lenders and consequently enabled companies to raise finance on favourable terms.

* We had in mind loo that the convertible type of **security** can be a particularly appropriate means of financing development and expansion of Australian resources.

* From an investor's standpoint, convertible borrowings combine the advantages of a fixed interest issue in terms of income and **security** with the opportunity of later conversion into share capital if the company performs successfully.

* I have arranged for a memorandum giving comprehensive explanations of the technical provisions of the Bill to be circulated to members before it is debated.I mention that the conditions proposed to be attached to deductibility of interest on convertible securities correspond to a large degree with the terms on which this type of **security** has in the recent past been issued overseas.

* That is an enormous expenditure on the health, social **security**, and veterans' affairs areas of the appropriation.

* The Government has a real concern and a sense of commitment to people in need and this is demonstrated by the budgetary allocation for the Department of Social **Security** which has risen to a record $7,009m compared with $6,562m in the previous financial year, an increase of about 6.8 per cent.

* I also give an assurance to the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  that I will convey to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in due course the views and the suggestions that he has made in regard to the way in which family allowances should be dealt.

* Department of Health, Department of Social **Security**, and Department of Veterans' Affairs, together.

* As a result of that article I made representations to the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  and to the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  drawing their attention to the article.

* You will wish to know that officers of my Department together with officers of the Departments of Social **Security** and Employment and Industrial Relations will shortly examine all the procedures involved with a view to closing any loopholes.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
Our work in the last 5 months has lain not in forcing new directions upon Australia's foreign policy but in making new definitions of the role of foreign policy.

* Australia's international relations, like those of any other country, must always be directed to maintaining the nation's **security** and integrity.

* The Government's foreign policy rests upon the belief that Australia, given her resources, her geographical position, her historical and cultural background and the character and aspirations of her people, is well placed to make a serious contribution to the preservation of peace and the promotion of the welfare of our neighbours, while at the same time and by the same path, promoting her own interests and **security**.

* By this we mean that the movements towards political, economic and social betterment in these countries should proceed along their own course with as little outside interference or intervention as possible and in a climate of **security**.

* One way in which we shall seek to develop these bilateral relations is through our association and consultation with our regional fellow members of the **Security** Council, notably, India and Indonesia.

* One of the forms which the quest for longer-term **security** measures has taken is in proposals relating to zones of peace and neutrality in South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean.

* The maintenance of our alliance with the United States under ANZUS remains most important for our **security**, since by its very nature it has created and guarantees in the Pacific a zone of peace in which the peoples of the region have for the last 20 years been free to pursue their political, economic and social goals without fear of hostile intervention or attack.

* Prompt, reliable and comprehensive information is vital to the maintenance of global peace and **security**.

* It is notable that Vietnam has still not endorsed Russia's proposal for an Asian collective **security** scheme and that it continues to be a member of such institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

* Lucas Heights, N.S.W., dated 25 May 1979, to sub-section leaders relating to **security** arrangements at the Establishment  (Hansard,  5 June 1979, page 2950)?

* Has the Government investigated claims that Japanese anti-nuclear activists are training local anti-nuclear activists in Australia: if so, (a) what is the nature of the alleged **security** threat?, (b) how many Japanese anti-nuclear activists are suspected of being in Australia?, (c) how and when did they arrive?, (d) is there evidence that they are training local activists or anti-nuclear groups to use nonlegitimate methods to express their anti-nuclear activity: if so, what are these methods?

* and (e) what is the nature of **security** arrangements taken to counter this alleged threat for the purpose of protecting (i) employees at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and (ii) residents living in close proximity to the Commission at Lucas Heights.

* Does the Government consider that (a) residents who have expressed legitimate concern about the siting of the Research Establishment and the levels of radioactive discharges in the atmosphere and in the Woronora River (b) all or any Australian opponent to the nuclear industry, and (c) opponents to the Government's decision to mine uranium, pose serious threats to Australian **security**.

* Does the Government have the right to place any opponents under surveillance at any particular time whenever allegations of **security** risks are made relating to the operations of the Commission, mining of uranium and the nuclear industry.

* However, I do believe that one of the driving forces which leads a person to decide on a Public Service career is the **security** of permanency.

* That **security**, as I said, is destroyed by this Bill.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 5 May 1977: 
The purpose of the Bill is to amend repatriation legislation to enable repatriation Service and other means test pensioners to continue to receive their pensions when they leave Australia.

* This will honour, in the repatriation field, the Government's undertaking to allow all Australian residents who have gained the right to receive any social **security** pension, to enjoy that right wherever they choose to live.

* In addition to providing for continuation of payments to pensioners wherever they choose to live outside Australia, the provisions introduced by this Bill will also allow a social **security** pensioner living overseas, if he wishes and is otherwise eligible, to transfer to a repatriation Service pension, or vice versa, thus giving him the same rights in this respect as would be available to him in Australia.

* -Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that the United Nations **Security** Council is considering a resolution directed at the closure of various Rhodesia information centres?

* These parties are deeply suspicious of  President  Nixon's attempts to bring about peace, **security** and stability in the world through understanding with China.

* Yet, in August the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said that such a telephone service would be installed within a few weeks.

* There is no way out of it other than for the United Nations **Security** Council to meet and to decide that the present fighting in Lebanon must stop and that a major United Nations **security** force must take over while the new constitution is being written.

* The Minister for Foreign Affairs has given us at least some basis for hope, but I would be happy if he would return to the United Nations to make sure that our words and our thoughts come before the **Security** Council.

* Therefore, although I commend the able speech given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would suggest that the majority of those who have been connected with the Middle East and know the Middle East would hope that he would return to the United Nations forthwith and make sure that our views are made absolutely known to the **Security** Council and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and that the ceasefire should come about in the Lebanon as soon as possible.

* **security** and to contain the Vietcong.

* Government seems to believe that the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation should use these powers as a matter of course.

* Whilst we are prepared to accept the use of ministerial warrants in the **security** area, we do not believe that they should be used, except as a very last resort.

* The principal goal of the Australian defence policy is the **security** of the nation and its interests and not until this present plan was announced were the defence Forces properly able to look forward to a planned program.

* The whole defence of this country must be planned carefully and sensibly and I would suggest- it is not my own suggestion for it has been canvassed before- that we need a Cabinet committee for national **security** and that all defence policies be co-ordinated with other major decisions we make so that they interlock and defence decisions accompany major economic considerations.

* In Australia over the past 10 years, expenditure on social **security** and welfare has increased almost sevenfold, from $1.3 billion in 1969-70 to $5 billion in 1975-76, and to an estimated $8.9 billion in 1979-80.

* Even if adjustments are made for spending on family allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, expenditure on social **security** and welfare as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76 to 2 1 per cent in 1979-80.

* Over the past 10 years the number of people in receipt of social **security** pensions and benefits has more than doubled, from about one million in 1969 to over two million in 1979.

* At the same time the number of people in the labour force has increased by only 24 per cent, so the House can see that there has been a smaller increase in the taxation base of the economy than in the number of pensioners and social **security** beneficiaries.

* Those ratios do not include unemployment, sickness and special benefits; they do include the more permanent types of social **security** payments.

* In short, those who say that they are opposed to the cutbacks in the social **security** budget and in social welfare spending generally should specify where those cutbacks have been made and say how much they would increase expenditure in those areas and how the revenue to cover the increased expenditure should be raised.

* In view of the increasing numbers of drug thefts from both retail and wholesale pharmacists, what steps can be taken to strengthen **security**?

* The Government has refused to give these employees any guarantee of **security** of employment.

* As is normally the case with United Nations peacekeeping operations, a force for Namibia would be set up pursuant to a resolution of the UN **Security** Council, which would provide it with a specific mandate spelling out its role and charter of operations.

* It is expected that the **Security** Council will meet towards the end of this month or the beginning of September to consider a report from the Secretary-General on the proposed operation of the force and to decide on its establishment.

* It will not be until this investigation is concluded and its recommendations adopted by the **Security** Council that more will be known of the tasks the force will have to perform, the extent and type of units likely to be required, the command arrangements and the difficulties likely to be met in carrying out the UN mandate.

* By way of background I should explain that the adoption by the **Security** Council of the proposals of the five Western members of the Council for a peaceful settlement in Namibia represents the first major success for Western diplomacy in southern Africa.

* This has demonstrated our continuing support for the aims and objectives of the United Nations Charter; most importantly, the maintenance of international peace and **security**.

* In the light of this developing conflict, the five Western members of the **Security** Council last year instituted talks with all interested parties, including South Africa and SWAPO.

* These could adversely affect its operation, especially in any combat situation, and have implications for its **security**.

* Should there be delay in the electoral program or a deterioration in the general **security** situation, the UN force may well be required to stay on.

* **Security** in these days is a vitally important matter and it is not something that this House can take lightly.

* I think it needs to be understood that measures to undertake proper **security** in this Parliament are measures designed not only to protect members of this House, maybe not even principally designed to protect members of this House, but also to protect other people to whom we have very significant obligations.

* The attendants, the clerks, and other people who service this building could be put at risk if **security** for the Parliament and the parliamentary building is not adequate.

* Quite clearly they could not come into this building if the **security** arrangements were not adequate having regard to their own office and their own position.

* He has been a most distinguished police officer in **security** matters and has been significantly involved in providing adequate **security** for the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

* Any resources that  Mr Speaker  and the  President  regard as being necessary for the **security** of the Parliament will clearly be made available by the Government as they ought to be.

* There is no question that the responsibility for the **security** of the Parliament resides with the Presiding Officers,  Mr Speaker  and the  President.

* Quite clearly again in one sense **security** is indivisible.

* In this sense those who have the actual physical task of undertaking **security** in the House of Commons have absolute responsibility to the Presiding Officers in the Commons and the Lords- to draw an analogy to this place,  Mr Speaker  and the  President-  and would know and understand the general **security** arrangements that can be made available in an emergency to assist with the internal task of protection of the Commons.

* We recognise that **security** is necessary for everybody in this country.

* We recognise, of course, that **security** of Parliament has some special significance.

* We are convinced ourselves that the **security** measures taken in the past have been rather reasonable and certainly effective.

* We find that at times it is possible to over-emphasise **security** measures and thus attract more deranged people to take an interest in trying to break **security**.

* We welcome all the remarks the Prime Minister made about **security** in the nation, but we recognise, as members of Parliament, that when we leave this place we are at the mercy of anybody who wants to deal us some mortal or injurious blow.

* Speakers on both sides of the Houses have made observations and suggestions on social welfare matters which I have noted, and I will make sure that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in the other place is made aware of them.

* I have heard him speak in this place before and as a previous Treasurer and Minister responsible for Social **Security** his remarks did not really become him.

* This Bill, or both Bills, represent the Government's first step in achieving its social **security** and repatriation policy objectives.

* I presume that when the member for Oxley was the Minister in charge of social **security** he faced the same problems in 1973 and 1974 when he did not include increases in children's allowances in his autumn increases.

* And I remind the honourable member again of the point that I made in the first speech that I made on the subject that the Income **Security** Review Committee will report on all aspects of social **security** benefits.

* I refer first of all to those remarks which are concerned with social **security** matters.

* The honourable member for Prospect has misrepresented remarks made by the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in the other place.

* The honourable member for Grayndler who, I might say, was one of the few members of the Opposition who did make a constructive contribution to the debate, also said that he was not aware that there was a committee dealing with income **security** review.

* The Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Guilfoyle,  in replying to a question without notice from  Senator Coleman  said: 
I wish to complete an answer, which I gave to  Senator Coleman  during question time earlier today, with regard to the membership of the Income **Security** Review Committee.

* consists of representatives of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of the Treasury, the Taxation Office, the Department of Repatriation and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.

* The honourable member tried to liken the social **security** pensions to the war disability pensions that the repatriation system grants.

* The war disability pensions are paid for compensation and therefore should not be equated or likened to those social **security** pensions.

* Listening to the remarks of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  I think I could be excused for believing that this chamber was a mutual admiration society.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) Responsibility for administering the Australian Assistance Plan rests not with one officer but with the Director-General and officers from various divisions of the Department of Social **Security**.

* -I understand that the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea,  Mr Somare,  said in the House of Assembly last week that the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  had assured his Government that the employment **security** payments were never considered as aid by the Liberal-Country Party Government when in government.

* In a statement that he issued as Minister for External Territories on 27 October 1972 he said that both the then Australian Government and the Papua New Guinea Government had accepted the Simpson report, the report which gave rise to the employment **security** scheme, in principle and, with minor exceptions which do not concern us today, the whole of the reports recommendations.

* As I have said elsewhere in my report, it would be reasonable for the Commonwealth to take into account in fixing future aid to Papua New Guinea the costs involved under the employment **security** and future staffing arrangements I have recommended.

* I might say as the person who was responsible for the offer of $500m at Kirribilli House meeting in 1974 in the presence of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea, the Minister for Finance of Papua New Guinea, and the Minister for Foreign Relations of Papua New Guinea as he then was, when I put forward that figure of $500m it was very clear in my mind, on the basis of the precedents that had been established by the previous Government, that the employment **security** scheme that the payments were included in the aid.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I am aware that the exemption rate has not been increased beyond $20 since September 1972.

* The income **security** review group is presently examining all aspects of the Australian income **security** system and will undoubtedly make recommendations to the Government as soon as policy options are available to it.

* The first and main objective of Medibank is to give every Australian on identical terms automatic **security** against the cost of medical and hospital treatment, at reasonable cost to the community.

* The Government is concerned that the means of air travel available to national leaders and, from time to time, to visiting dignitaries and groups of ministers, fail to provide protection against terrorist activity or other threats against **security**.

* An assessment of aircraft **security** considerations has been undertaken.

* This assessment indicates that the **security** risk in travel by foreign owned commercially scheduled aircraft or by privately owned chartered aircraft, whether Australian owned or foreign owned, is unacceptably high.

* 34 Squadron, against the background of **security** requirements and the pattern of increased usage.

* In the interests of our national **security**, the Australian Government attaches great importance to the presence in this area, under the ANZUS alliance, of the United 
Throughout the second half of the 19th century there was a mandarin led guerrilla war against the French in which ambushes, assassinations, terror, mass executions, search and destroy missions, concentration camps and tiger cages were as common as in recent years.

* Much of the **security** and cohesion of the villages was destroyed.

* The unloading of hoarded gold is most unlikely to occur because the reason for hoarding is the knowledge that its value will not fall off, and if the price increases it is more likely that hoarders will purchase even more gold, as it is a **security** against a devaluation of the local currency.

* If this privilege of being able to call a doctor at the local call charge were extended to rural areas it would give people in isolated areas a feeling of some **security**.

* Therefore, although he argued that initially there would be cultural damage, eventually there would be cultural **security** and cultural integration as a result of such revenues.

* I was about to call him the Minister for **Security**!

* Fancy describing him as the Minister for **Security**.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 1 8 October 1 978: 
Would the Department of Social **Security** reject a claim for social **security** benefits in cases where it knew that the applicant had entered Australia without an entry permit.

* If so, how many such applicants have been refused social **security** benefits m the last 5 years.

* The nation's **security** must always command a high priority on its resources.

* Our major review of the international **security** outlook last year noted certain unfavourable developments and the uncertainty of the future, but we judged our prospects on balance to be favourable.

* Our present peace-time strategy is to support as best we may over a range of policies the continuation of the presently favourable prospects for our national **security**; to maintain effective defence relations with our friends and allies, especially the United States and in our neighbouring regions; and to maintain a substantial and efficient force-in-being that demonstrates our military capability to deal with situations that could develop with short warning and to expand in time should the need for this arise during the longer term.

* The House will not expect me to give an account of these studies, since obviously they must command a high **security** classification.

* Does he recall one of the points at issue in that debate relating to the appointment of a  Mr Harragan,  formerly of the Department of Social **Security**, with Facom Australia Ltd, a likely supplier of computer equipment?

* Anyone who in any way inhibits the ability of the Defence Force in its carrying out of its functions in respect of the **security** of Australia or Australia's defence is a person who should and would be dealt with.

* Any person who planned- the Minister said that the **security** forces would not be able to conduct surveillance on a person while he was planning- an action such as he described would be acting in breach of Commonwealth law.

* I think we ought to be trying in this case to ensure that this legislation will in fact carry out the functions of enhancing **security** and of ensuring that the **security** organisations in Australia are able to carry out their functions and that the people of Australia will have confidence that they are carrying out those functions in a manner which the people of a democratic society are entitled to expect.

* I repeat what I said earlier in the day: The establishment of a **security** file on a person places a very serious limitation on that person's civil rights in this country.

* The ability to establish a **security** file on a matter which is deemed to be subversive but which is not illegal would seem to be an extension of the inroads into the legal rights of citizens which should not be tolerated in a democratic society.

* There are adequate provisions for **security** forces to institute surveillance in any situation in which a person is a **security** risk or takes part in activities which would bring him under notice as a possible **security** risk.

* -Mr Chairman, we should keep in mind the very wide net of laws which protect our **security** organisations, our defence forces and those other activities which have to do with the **security** and defence of Australia.

* I would go further in Labor's great and historic concern for the disadvantaged, the underprivileged and the weak- in the primacy we give to justice and individual and family **security**- women may have more to gain from a Labor Government than men.

* If we look at the whole range of Labor initiatives and Labor achievements- in health, in education, in social **security**, in child care, in industrial policy, in incomes policy, in human rights- we can see that women and children are as much the beneficiaries as men, and that those in greatest need receive the greatest benefit.

* We introduced a supporting mother's benefit- the most important single innovation in social **security** for a generation.

* Every statement of this kind from  Mr Fraser  is a threat to the **security** of women and everyone on social welfare benefits.

* And we can be sure that if the Fraser axe falls on social **security** the first benefits to B9 will be those introduced by the Labor Government, which have not yet had time to be universally accepted and institutionalised.

* But the general point I make is this: The supporting mother's benefit is merely one aspect of social **security**, and social **security** is not a specific objective for women but an objective for everyone.

* It is wrecking creative programs for the health, **security** and welfare of women and children just as it is wrecking those for men.

* Fourth, women, like everyone else, want some reasonable prospects of **security** and companionship; a decent environment; surroundings and services that are at least modestly convenient, congenial and attractive; reasonable access to libraries, theatres, parks, playgrounds and transport.

* The next Labor Government will provide a full charter of job **security** and equality of opportunity for every woman who wants or needs to work.

* No government has done more to threaten their jobs and **security**.

* However, I shall raise the matter with my colleague the Minister for Social **Security** who has been having consultations with the States on a possible National Compensation Program.

* Yet the Government so far has refused to give similar **security** to apple and pear growers.

* Such finance would be made available on the **security** of the fruit vested in the Authority.

* He may say that it is rot, but he has not bothered to examine Australia's **security**.

* We are talking now about Australia's future **security** and filling the vacuum in the Indian Ocean.

* This is why I submit that Cockburn Sound becomes of vital importance with regard to the Indian Ocean and the southern seas, and therefore with regard to the **security** of Australia in the link-up with Simonstown in South Africa.

* The first appears on page 22 and reads: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-If he did so, why was it necessary for the Premier to go there?

* I was able to have a very successful trip there but I am not able to bring back any promise of **security** for the workers in the Pilbara.

* In return for that commitment, surely it is not too much to ask for Japan to ensure some **security** with regard to the continuity of its purchases.

* One of them relates to social **security**.

* Following the 1975 election, approval to continue the operation of the Committee was given by the Minister for Social **Security** in April 1976.

* The IDC comprised the Departments of Social **Security** (convenor), Prime Minister and Cabinet, Employment and Industrial Relations, Education and Aboriginal Affairs.

* 6) The IDC reported to the Minister for Social **Security** in July 1977. 
and (9) I understand that the Minister for Social **Security** is now considering possible action arising from the report of the IDC on South Sea Islanders and its recommendations and will be making an announcement soon.

* As the Minister for the Navy,  (Dr McKay),  who is at the table, and also the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury)  have already pointed out, the overriding consideration in questions of this sort involves the defence and **security** of the country.

* As I have said, my overriding consideration must be the defence and **security** of this country and I believe that this requirement is satisfied.

* One cannot talk about what one will do unless the aspect of national **security** is covered.

* In any deliberations concerning the future of the foreshores of Sydney Harbour involving the changing of defence facilities, prime consideration must be given to whether or not the **security** of the country will be threatened by their removal or diminution.

* It has said that initially we must safeguard the defence **security** of Australia but within that requirement we will release land around Sydney Harbour.

* They then could have gone ahead and spoken about nationalisation and the comprehensive national system of social **security** that only a socialist government could devise.

* I suggest that the blame falls on the Government, and particularly on the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden),  for not bringing the Bills before the Parliament at an earlier date.

* The question I ask the Minister for Social **Security** and the Government is: Did the Government bring the Bills in late to delay the payout of several millions of dollars?

* I would like to direct my comments now to some of the points made in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**.

* This indicates that there has been a substantial redistribution of purchasing power to pensioners and social **security** beneficiaries.

* I invite the Minister for Social **Security** to come with me into a supermarket in which the average pensioner does his shopping.

* It is the Department of Social **Security** that foots the bill for those people who are registered as unemployed.

* It stated: 
The Working Party, consisting of senior officers of the Department of Labor and the Department of Social **Security**, was set up by the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr BUI  Hayden, M.P., and myself to conduct a thorough examination of the work test and the procedures followed and instructions to officers concerned with its application.

* Obviously, they are more empty words from the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Social **Security**.

* Suffice it to say that the document from which I have quoted was obtained by the Attorney-General by going to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Canberra.

* Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act authorises the Commissioner of Taxation to communicate information to the Department of Social **Security** for the purpose of the administration of any law of the Commonwealth relating to pensions, allowances, endowments or benefits.

* The Commissioner has stated that information is provided only where a written request is made by a responsible officer of the Department of Social **Security** and then only where it is established that the information being sought is necessary for the administration of laws for which that Department is responsible.

* Officers of the Department of Social **Security** are not afforded access to income tax returns nor are they provided with information which is not relevant to those functions.

* As an example I mention that in the largest town in my electorate there is no office of the Department of Social **Security**.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** been drawn to the recent statement by the Leader of the Opposition that the Liberal Party in determining the payment for doctors' services advocated the establishment of a standing tribunal to review fees annually while taking into account movement in costs during the previous year?

* The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 4 1 of the Atomic Energy Act 1953 which concerns mining for prescribed substances on behalf of or in association with the Commonwealth, and to amend a number of the **security** provisions of the Act.

* In relation to the **security** provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, the Government's policy that penal provisions which were largely enacted for defence purposes would not be applied to ordinary commercial undertakings, was made clear in the debate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill (No.

* asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 7 November 1978: 
How many of those persons appealed to the Social **Security** Appeals Tribunal during each of the same periods.

* and (2) The delay in establishing the high **security** quarantine station at Cocos is a matter of concern.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Government came into office on a promise of open government.

* I am speaking now in particular about the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* I have been given to understand that last week the Minister for Social **Security** authorised two of his senior civil servants to negotiate with the National Standing Committee on Private Hospitals and the private health funds about amendments to his so-called health plan.

* A spokesman for the Minister for Social **Security**,  Mr Hayden,  criticised  Dr Deeble  today for having exceeded his brief.

* The spokesman said that  Dr Deeble,  a special adviser to the Department of Social **Security**, had no authority to commit the Minister - as he had done in the document - to proposed amendments to the scheme.

* Statements were made by the Minister for Social **Security** and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to this effect: 'It is obvious that the Opposition will not allow the health Bills to be passed.

* May I ask the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  when his second reading speech on this Bill was prepared and typed?

* The Minister for Social **Security** replied: About a fortnight ago .

* I will speak a little more on this question of the meeting of officers of the Department of Social **Security** and the private hospitals and health funds.

* I ask the Minister for Social **Security**: Is that true or false?

* I am sorry to have to do this to the Minister for Social **Security** - I genuinely am - but when a Minister makes those kinds of statements to the national Parliament I believe that the Parliament and the people are entitled to an explanation.

* Measures affecting individuals justifiably suspected of, or engaged in, activities prejudicial to the **security** of the state are not deemed to be discrimination under the convention, provided that the individual concerned shall have the right of appeal to a competent body established in accordance with national practice.

* So if a person belonged to a subversive organisation and he was likely to be a threat to the **security** of the country, of course we would have a right to exclude that person from employment in sensitive areas of government where his bent or prejudice could be of detriment to the country's **security**.

* We say that where discrimination is practised for the purposes of safeguarding the nation's **security**, that discrimination has to be justified.

* These safeguards and limitations will be as follows: A judge of the Federal Court or a supreme court must be satisfied by information on oath as to the justification for issue of a warrant; information obtained by the interception or inspection may only be used for narcotics inquiries; there is a prohibition on communication except in strictly limited circumstances; these concern very serious criminal offences and **security** matters; the Commissioner will be required to report to the Minister not only on the use made of the information but also whether, and if so to whom, the information is communicated; and the Minister may, under section 13 (6) of the Australian Federal 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 17 August 1977: 
These legislative measures that we are debating tonight involving our Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation should be received and debated with two predominant and priority considerations.

* To protect the rights of those people who call themselves Australians and who in the majority are law-abiding citizens, there must be some form of **security** organisation even if the socalled rights- the civil rights- of those few subversive elements have to be denied them.

* I and the party I represent, the National Country Party, have no doubt that an organisation such as the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation is necessary.

* Every democracy services and preserves that democracy by providing **security** organisations such as the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States of America and other similar organisations in developed nations.

* For instance, clause 7 of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation Bill sets out the terms and conditions for the appointment of the Director-General.

* Surely, even beyond all of these powers the government of the day, whichever political philosophy it has, must have the final control or veto if such circumstances arise in the administration or functioning of the **security** services that require them to be amended, altered, deleted or perhaps even to terminate the legislation at any time.

* Consequently, there is an increasing need for a more efficient and independent **security** organisation to weld these people into our society and to protect them.

* None of these is contemplated within our present ASIO Bill although I am firmly of the belief that all Australians should be possessed of some form of identification or social **security** number, as is the situation in the United States, in order to prevent the abuses under our Government's welfare and national health programs, but that is not related to the **security** of our country.

* Our **security** must be updated to meet the present conditions.

* In spite of the necessity for an effective **security** and intelligence organisation working in conjunction with State authorities and international organisations, I can appreciate the fears of some, particularly in comparing the activities of our own Organisation with the activities of **security** organisations in communist and totalitarian countries.

* If there is an argument it is whether the legislation strikes a reasonable balance between the maintenance of national **security** and the protection of personal privacy and individual rights.

* As I mentioned previously, the Bill provides accountability to the Minister, the Prime Minister and also the Leader of the Opposition but, in some instances, if it appears that **security** may be breached the reports may not be as full a record of the activities of ASIO as some people would want or expect in order to form the accounting judgments that may be necessary.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-The Minister for Health will be aware that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works was instructed as a matter of urgency to investigate and recommend on the site for an off-shore maximum **security** animal quarantine station.

* I remind the House that within the last week or so this House rejected a censure motion against my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  and that last week the Senate rejected a censure motion against my colleague the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* The Senate also rejected a censure motion against the Minister for Social **Security**.

* In the Senate, my colleagues the Minister for Social **Security** and the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  have answered a barrage of questions levelled at them in respect of court proceedings taken against persons alleged to have defrauded the social **security** benefit system.

* We had a debate about the sub judice rule last week and,  Mr 
I take, for example, the position adopted by my colleague, the Minister for Social **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security** is not the Minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police.

* Why should not the Department of Social **Security**, which has responsibility for the administration of the Social Services Act, inquire into allegations of fraud or abuse under the Act.

* Quite properly, the Minister for Social **Security** has seen to it that inquiries, as appropriate, were made.

* I have not heard from the Opposition any support for the propriety of the Commonwealth Police carrying out investigations once matters were put into their hands by the client department, the Department of Social **Security**.

* I have not heard from the Opposition about the propriety of the Attorney-General of the day, through his law officers, giving advice where appropriate to either the Australian Federal Police or the Department of Social **Security** in a matter of this kind.

* It is not unknown for the Attorney-General to offer immunity from prosecution for a witness - 
The Opposition has sought to accuse the Government of a lack of a proper sense of ministerial responsibility because of the activities of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* That legislation which has now passed the Parliament enacts the most modern comprehensive legislation dealing with the **security** forces of any country.

* I ask the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  or the Postmaster-General  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  who is now representing the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  to convey my remarks to the Minister.

* The Opposition wants to shut its eyes to the kind of world that we live in and wants to have all our forces here, believing that that would add to Australian **security** when in fact it would do a great deal to harm it and damage it over a period.

* Malaysia at the very time when the United Kingdom Defence Minister was in those 2 countries beginning to work out the terms and conditions and circumstances in which there will be a continuing military presence of the three arms of the British Forces, arms which are welcomed very much by these 2 countries and by Australia as adding once again to the general **security** of the region and as continued acceptance of traditional British responsibility in this part of the world.

* How could we expect to be effective in helping to shape our own environment if we rendered all efforts to establish and maintain **security** null and void by our own actions?

* But none of this means anything unless we are prepared to help provide general **security** in addition.

* Without genera] **security**, economic aid and policies of trade designed to help are worth nothing.

* But there is not a person in this House who does not want peace in this area and **security** in South East Asia.

* We believe that there will be no permanent **security** for Australia unless we can establish a kind of world in which there is **security** for all the small countries in our own part of the world.

* I hope that one way in which the Government **security** market could be made more attractive would be to have a look at this market.

* I have seen indexation of wages; I have seen indexation of taxes and I have seen indexation of various social **security** payments.

* In this circumstance, he will get the same **security** but the interest rate he will receive will be a matter of how the economy performs.

* A debate about **security** is traditionally a fairly bipartisan debate in the House but,  Mr Acting Speaker,  you will pardon me if I feel freed of any of those constraints after the contributions of both Government supporters.

* First, and by far the most helpful, are the abridged findings and recommendations of  Mr Justice  Hope as part of his third report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and **Security**.

* Concern about those matters misses the whole point of this assessment agency whose purpose is merely to assess intelligence collected by other Government **security** bodies.

* Our best starting point in relation to the **security** interest in this country is one of the statements made by  Mr Justice  Hope in which he talked about Australia's national **security** interests.

* The effect of that will be nothing less than to imperil the **security** of this country, if we hamstring him in that way.

* If we are serious about intelligence and **security** in this country, we ought to insist- the appropriation for that Office is voted by this Parliament- that the Director-General not be subject to any scrutiny by the Public Service Board.

* Hopefully one day the Parliament, by means of a parliamentary committee, will be taken into the confidence of the **security** services in this country, in the same way as the United States Congress is taken into the confidence of the **security** services in that country by means of its Congressional committees.

* The Office will be subject to policy control and managerial oversight through the Committee of Ministers on Intelligence and **Security** .

* In relation to the collection of intelligence, of course, all **security** services in Australia will need to have regard to policy directions given by the government of Australia.

* The Prime Minister, in his 5 May tabling statement, skated over the question of the briefing of Leaders of the Opposition on **security** matters.

* It marks the point where the failure of the Government's overall economic strategy begins seriously to affect the Government's capacity to maintain effective programs on social services and social **security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who began her Ministry back in December 1975 with considerable optimism concerning the Government's policies, is now the victim of the prolonged economic recession which those policies have produced.

* In December 1975 the Minister for Social **Security** spoke of the fact that Australia could not be a prosperous nation with so many people out of work.

* Unfortunately for the Department of Social **Security** the effect of this prolonged recession has been to increase enormously the responsibilities of the Department while the Government constantly seeks to restrain public expenditure across the board.

* They have to be recognised as representing a rather desperate attempt on its part to restrain spending in the social **security** area for no rational reason other than its desire to save revenue in oblique ways which have the less dramatic political impact.

* Biannual indexation was being held up by the Government and the Minister for Social **Security** as evidence of the Government's concern and, indeed, as proof of the Government's credibility.

* The Minister for Social **Security**,  Senator Guilfoyle,  has earned a reputation for fighting vigorously to protect the interests of her Department.

* In this Budget we can afford another $7m for Department of Social **Security** staff to try to cut down the rolls by what they estimate to be something like 1 7,000 people at a reported saving of $50m.

* One could go on to look at the treatment of the unemployed by the Government in its social **security** policy.

* As the Minister for Social **Security** has repeatedly pointed out, 60 per cent of all personal income tax goes into pensions and benefits.

* It represented a strategy designed to protect the interests of working people by using the tax system to make real transfers of wealth to the lower income groups via a resources tax and capital gains taxes, the development of universal systems of health and social **security**, and the opening up of meaningful work opportunities for the unemployed.

* It is simply not good enough to be encouraging millions of Australians to accept a second-class standard of living while the lucky, the tough or the powerful enjoy the **security** of their ruling class situation.

* We need a new approach to social **security**.

* We need more established rights and less arbitrary discretion being practised by Directors-General or other members of the Department of Social **Security**.

* We need to recognise that social **security** will continue to absorb a very high proportion of the Commonwealth Budget, but ensure that it is not paid for by working people in the main; that it is genuinely redistributive.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister shall be informed by the DirectorGeneral as to the existence of any file, dossier or record held by or compiled by the Organization concerning a particular individual if the Minister so requests, but the Minister is not entitled to have access to any file, dossier or record concerning a particular individual unless the Director-General considers that it is in the interests of **security** that the Minister should have such access. '

* The Minister should have complete knowledge of what is happening in the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* That was disclosed from a **security** file which the Minister had.

* The then Prime Minister,  Mr Harold  Holt, was asked why detailed information from a **security** file had been given to the House by the then Minister for the Army.

* Mr Holt  said: 
This shows that the then Prime Minister had access to a **security** file.

* The Opposition is making this very fine distinction that there has to be accountability and knowledge qf the existence of information, but most certainly not the details of the information unless it directly related to **security**.

* The Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation was set up on 16 March 1949 by the then Prime Minister,  Mr Chifley.

* The memorandum to the DirectorGeneral states: 
It is your responsibility to keep each Minister informed of all matters affecting **security** corning to your knowledge- 
.

* You will take especial care to ensure that the work of the **Security** Service is strictly limited to what is necessary .

* It is essential that the **Security** Service should be kept absolutely free from any political bias or influence, and nothing should be done that might lend colour to any suggestion that it is concerned with the interests of any particular section of the community .

* The real **security** is in ministerial accountability.

* The nation's **security** is the Government's first responsibility.

* At the present time, however, it can be said that Australia's situation is favourable and that various important factors and trends in the international situation support Australia's **security** into the longer term.

* We and our advisers do not at present foresee any deterioration in our strategic environment that would involve consideration of the commitment of our defence force to military operations to protect Australia's **security** or strategic interests.

* This view of Australia's long term **security** was, I may remind the House, the view accepted by previous governments in recent years.

* But we understand that the regional governments see internal **security** questions as their own domestic concern and are not looking for external involvement in internal **security** situations.

* The ASEAN governments have been discussing proposals for a 'zone of peace, freedom and neutrality' in South East Asia that would preserve their **security** and independence and allow them to pursue their national and regional development free from disruption by military confrontation in the region.

* Australia has an abiding interest in the **security** and peace of South East Asia and we welcome moves that can further reduce the likelihood of military confrontation there.

* No threat of external military attack against Papua New Guinea is foreseen and we see no major risk to Australia's **security** arising there.

* Regarding internal **security**, honourable members will have noted the important statement on 20 August by the Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations in the Papua New Guinea Government,  Mr Kiki.

* The Minister said that 'Papua New Guinea was determined to look after its own **security** problems in the future' and: 
The favourable developments in the strategic environment that I have outlined strongly support our view that Australia is unlikely to come under strategic pressure or military threat.

* We shall certainly maintain Australia's **security** association with the United States and New Zealand under the ANZUS Treaty.

* In the meantime, it sustains contact and co-operation in a variety of practical defence fields and in consultations about defence and **security** matters that are of advantage to all 3 partners in the alliance.

* In matters affecting the nation's **security** it is necessary to move with prudence.

* I wish to stress also the extent to which Australia nowadays and in the future must accept the primary and independent responsibility for safeguarding our **security** and strategic interests.

* Again I should point out that a government has a responsibility to determine what amount of gross national product or gross domestic product should be spent on defence, but it has to make that decision together with other decisions that the Government finds necessary, particularly in relation to our existing program to improve education facilities in this country and to provide greater **security** opportunities for the citizens of Australia, and indeed in all of the domestic programs.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: white not opposing the Bill, the House is of opinion that the only satisfactory way to provide social services benefits is through a comprehensive national system of social **security** where benefits are above the poverty level and tied to an index adjusted at least annually'.

* Danes will also be discouraged by the less complete social **security** and welfare system provided in Australia.

* The House will well recollect that the inquiry sponsored by the Department of Immigration into the reasons why such a growing higher proportion of migrants are returning home established the major reason as being that social **security** and social welfare services - covering the broad conspectus of these things - in Australia are so inferior to what are available overseas.

* If he is neither candid nor credible - and I think the evidence supports this point of view, unkind as it might seem, but substantiated and put objectively - he is at least being consistent with the record of the non-Labor parties since Federation in respect of national superannuation, national social **security** insurance, or whatever term is preferred.

* Lyons Government because it did not introduce a social **security** programme to which it was committed.

* It has not touched a whole range of important areas which affect people's living standards, but most importantly of all it fails to concede that what is really needed in our community today is a comprehensive national system of social **security** in which the benefits paid are above the poverty level and tied to an index so that they are adjusted at least annually.

* The Australian Labor Party is committed to that and to national health insurance, national superannuation, national compensation and a guaranteedincome to cover all the other forms of social **security** benefits.

* In November 1973, the FAO Conference passed a resolution calling on governments to adopt an International Undertaking on World Food **Security**.

* The Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Government are to be congratulated.

* On 22 August last the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  asked the Minister for Social **Security** whether the Minister agreed that pension increases were falling behind average weekly earnings and that pensions would not catch up.

* In other words as a result of the present Budget - and its inflationary consequences - the aged pensioners, the widows, the invalids on social **security** will fall farther behind average earnings rather than beginning to catch up on them.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:  (1), (2) and (3)- 
Prime Minister had had his Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation agents check the facts, he would have been damned forever.

* Similarly, in social **security** areas there are substantial measures for migrant services throughout the community.

* Is it also a fact that the Myers inquiry recommended that the Director-General of Social **Security** should be relieved of the responsibility for interpreting section 107 (c) ( 1) of the Social Services Act and that his discretion in classifying the terms 'direct participant' and 'strike' should be limited, not extended?

* Of course, I recognise the need to specify circumstances in which information can be passed on to other agencies, to other law enforcement authorities, whether they are State or Territory police forces, to customs authorities and to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* For example, the building will house the Australian Embassy to France, which is a permanent member of the **Security** Council and a major world power.

* On 22 December the **Security** Council passed a resolution calling on governments to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General's special representative in establishing contact with all the parties in Timor.

* Despite the specific terms of the United Nations resolution the Fraser Government failed to make available to the special representative any transport and communications equipment which would have enabled him to make the fullest and earliest recommendations to the **Security** Council, it failed to make available to international aid agencies any transport, medical and food supplies required to succour or evacuate persons in the Territory and it failed to offer a venue for talks between all the parties in East Timor.

* That was the Foreign Minister's recipe for a settlement of the Timor question, for the stability and **security** of our region.

* (i) and (ii) Complete details of the eligibility conditions tinder the Federal Republic of Germany's social **security** scheme are not known.

* While no immediate threat to the **security** of Australia is foreseen, our evident ability to support our allies, or to prepare ourselves to cope with contingencies which might emerge at a later date, must not be prejudiced if our longer term credibilityto friends and potential enemies alike- is to be maintained.

* am asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
We of the Australian Labor Party believe also that people deserve **security**.

* People are not getting this **security** and freedom from this fear under this present Liberal-National Country Party Government.

* For all intents and purposes these progressive measures have been dismantled by a Fraser Government worshipping at the shrine of smaller government, at the shrine of 'let the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker', at the shrine of cutting government spending and the deficit at any price even though that price is bringing about unemployment and lesser employment **security** generally.

* Industry generally, thanks to the Labor Government, was on the way to offering satisfactory income **security** schemes where restructuring and rationalisation was necessary.

* There has been no income **security** for those people who have been discarded.

* We must be wary of allowing new facilities to be created before the existing facilities are being used to the full, with consequent **security** of employment for those who already have devoted their lives to the great motor manufacturing industry.

* The work force will respond if workers are given the dignity and **security** about which I have spoken.

* asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
I think it a sobering thought for all of us to reflect on the enormous amount of detail which is stored in the computer records of the Department of Social **Security**.

* They are: A. Commonwealth and State departments and other bodies expending public moneys, social **security** benefits or workers compensation or the like; B. Commonwealth and State departments and other bodies where expenditure of public moneys or social **security** benefits is not directly involved; C. Commonwealth or State departments where the protection of incoming revenues, the grant of concessions to pensioners or their liability in respect of advances and arrears of rent is involved.

* Even allowing that instructions had been followed, the very nature of my Department's personal records on its clients, the absence of **security** measures to protect privacy and the easy and rapid retrieval of computer stored information make it proper that all procedures should be reviewed.

* I am certain the Liberal Party and the Country Party would be distressed at any suggestion that the degree of access which they permitted to Department of Social **Security** files should extend to health insurance commission records.

* It will not of course, and it will cease in so far as records in the Department of Social **Security** are concerned.

* I have instructed my Director-General that all access to personal information recorded within the Department of Social **Security** will be restricted to cases (a) where there is explicit written authorisation or verifiable authorisation by the client concerned (b) in extreme cases where there exist grave reasons of public interest; and in such cases approval will be decided by either the Director-General or me on each individual case.

* Department of Social **Security** - Disclosure of Information from Department files - Ministerial statement, 21 November 1973.

* One is that the definitions should not be changed because we must allow an exercise of judgment to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* I have not bothered to consider the KGB in this debate because I believed that the Committee was debating the role of a secret agency or a **security** agency in a democratic society.

* Complete evaluation of the extent of the risk and assessment of what course should be followed to reduce it involve matters of national **security** and international relations which are beyond the ambit of the Inquiry.

* This is a real problem because the business of **security** and surveillance of the north, even going so far as the defence of the north, is a real problem.

* I urge the Minister to explain how that problem can be overcome and to set my mind at rest and also the mind of anyone else who is interested in the **security** of the north by assuring us that the operation of our armed Services in this area will not be impeded.

* Comprehensive Reciprocal Agreements on Social **Security** (Question No.

* First Assistant Secretary, International **Security** and Intelligence Division, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

* In line with this philosophy the proposed amendment provides for a greater control over machinery matters of government for the proposed Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly; control over a much wider number of matters of government; a reduction in the Australian Government's powers in the Bill; the provision of social **security** and an industrial court for Norfolk Island; the extension of Australian taxation legislation to Norfolk Island; a Bill of Rights to be included in the Bill; and the proposed Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to be elected by the fairest method to all concerned, in this instance proportional representation.

* 10) that the taxation and social **security** legislation of the Commonwealth be extended to Norfolk Island in full; and 
The financial cake remains in the hands of the tax evaders.

* Australian social **security** legislation is not to be extended to the island either.

* The Government has entrusted the social **security** of the islanders to the people who, before November 1976, were paying a paltry $10 a week allowance to those islanders who could not support themselves.

* I make it clear to the residents of Norfolk Island and to their representatives, who are here today and who were also here the other day, that the Labor Party's plan for Australian taxation and social **security** legislation to be extended to the island poses no threat to them.

* Social **security** payments will be tied to the Norfolk Island cost of living, not to that of Australia.

* The Australian Labor 
that the taxation and social **security** legislation of the Commonwealth be extended to Norfolk Island in full; and 
-The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.

* Waste paper from the Department of Social **Security** is recycled by arrangements with the Department of Administrative Services.

* The insurers have good **security**.

* Several arguments were put forward in the United Nations **Security** Council, ranging from the views of Indonesia, supported by the Philippines and Malaysia on the one hand, to those advanced by Fretilin supported by China, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau and the honourable member for Fraser on the other hand.

* Australia is not currently a member of the **Security** Council.

* Those points were embodied in the resolution finally adopted by the **Security** Council.

* The argument that Qantas cannot provide adequate **security** for a Prime Minister is a specious argument and false.

* Using the flimsy disguise of **security**, which I have already rebutted with the Prime Minister's own words, the Government is embarking upon a program to purchase not only two Boeing 727s but three Grumman Gulfstream luxury executive jets.

* I will go back to the Canadian trip in 1 976 and the Melbourne  Herald 
If $40m is available to purchase five new luxury aircraft, the first priority for that $40m should be to stimulate the economy, to provide job **security**, to get the shipyards back to work, to get the men at Chrysler back to work, and to secure our economy.

* The pre-occupation of Australian foreign policy with China and Japan and the pre-occupation of conservative Australian governments with **security** issues has obscured the rate of growth and economic importance of Korea.

* We welcome the fact that the Government recognises the importance of relations with Korea other than as an aspect of the **security** of Japan.

* We are concerned about the future **security** and stability of the Korean peninsula and the avoidance of war there.

* These remarks are relevant to the tabling of this Agreement because the Government has made quite clear the Agreement is to provide for significant co-operation between Australia and South Korea into the 21st century in an area of energy production and of sweeping social and international **security** significance.

* The harsh facts are that, firstly, the Government is continuing to do no more than mouth its commitment to selective elements of the proposals in the Fox report; secondly, the Government has not kept abreast of, and has not informed the Parliament of the pace of international developments concerning nonproliferation; and thirdly, the Government is pursuing a policy which is dangerous in terms of economic investment, political, social and environmental consequences and national **security**.

* For the information of honourable members I present Part 1 of the final report of the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry together with a statement by the Minister for Social **Security** relating to that report.

* Even of the $l,118m in the hands of other holders, $680m was held in the form of special bonds, which is a form of **security** tailored for individual investors.

* The working group will be representative of the Department of Home Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Education, the Department of Social **Security**, the Department of Science and the Environment and the National Library of Australia.

* In 1977, on the initiative of the then Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Social **Security**  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the National Library of Australia established the Working Party on Library Services for the Handicapped.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Social **Security** been directed to the boycotting action by some doctors of the nursing homes admission procedures introduced by the last Government?

* As a result, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social **Security** asked the Prime Minister whether they could examine alternative sources of funding.

* I direct my question to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* But after listening to the detailing of a number of tragic and unfortunate aircraft accidents I am moved to feel that many people who have occasion to work in the industry or who utilise the facilities of the industry may have some apprehension as to their **security** and wellbeing.

* Earlier, the Minister implied that if people paid taxes and received social **security** payments then they were not in the field of self-government; they were not looking after themselves.

* There has been some play on the use of the social **security** system.

* I understand that at present there are 36 people on Norfolk Island who are drawing social **security** pensions and there are 1 1 7 people drawing repatriation or veterans ' affairs pensions of some type.

* I suspect that as time goes by more Norfolk Islanders will spend their working lives on the mainland- as they must because Norfolk Island is not big enough to contain the population- and then return to Norfolk Island and, of course, draw Australian social **security** pensions.

* The last thing one would want to do is damage the social **security** of the island.

* I refer to its **security** not in the monetary sense but in the social sense.

* We have to find a formula which supplies to the people of Norfolk Island the same **security**, standard of living and advantages as the rest of the people on this continent and its outlying islands receive and still preserves the rights as the islanders have had them and as we hope to see them developed.

* The Government does not believe that Australia 's **security** would be advanced by acquiring nuclear weapons.

* I take it that nobody in this House - 
If any honourable member believes that Australia's **security** would be advanced by acquiring nuclear weapons I believe he has the obligation to tell the public that that is his view.

* The detailed functions of the Commission are very clearly set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden).

* An appeals tribunal system has been established in each State within the Department of Social **Security** and staffed by one departmental representative, because of the benefit of experience that he can bring to bear in such a tribunal, and 2 outside people who are selected because of their qualifications and experience in various fields and who accordingly, because they are outside people and experienced, can bring impartiality to bear in judgments on appeals.

* I have received proposals that the files of the Department of Social **Security** should be available for access by people who are receiving or have been receiving from the Department or who have applied to the Department for pension or benefit and where there is some dispute.

* I would like to see a similar principle introduced in relation to the files compiled on individuals in the community and held by the Department of Social **Security**.

* The Committee established in pursuance of the **Security** Council resolution of May 1968 has reported that, despite sanctions, Australia's exports to Southern Rhodesia have risen in each of the last 3 years and Australia has risen from ninth to second place among exporters to Southern Rhodesia.

* Thus in both trade and passports Australia is known to be defying United Nations resolutions of May 1968 and earlier and reaffirmed and reinforced as recently as 18th March by the **Security** Council.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Because we have this opportunity to speak in the debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Queen's Speech, following the prorogation of Parliament, I should like to review briefly the past year on some respects and to look at the future as it applies specifically to my electorate of Eden-Monaro.

* The pensioners in my area have some degree of **security** now that political decisions will not be involved in their pension rises.

* by leave- The report which has been tabled by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  sets down a pattern of responses to the potentials for, and actual threats to, the **security** of the community.

* It is clear that  Mr Justice  Hope, as he has done on previous occasions on matters of great public responsibility, where he has had a brief to carry out a review of such matters, has again in this report performed his task diligently, intelligently and with considerable beneficial effect for those people in the community, in government and other institutions serving government in the community who have to take decisions in these matters and have to respond to actual problems which may arise affecting **security** or prepare for the potential that may rest within the community from whatever cause for that sort of threat.

* What is clear is that in our Federal system there is a spread of authorities with responsibility in this sort of matter and that at a time of severe strain where an issue of **security** is concerned, with the absence of preparation, severe shortfalls can occur in the way in which the response takes place to those sorts of threats.

* It seemed to me that, in the resort to the use of military services at Bowral for instance last year in response to the unfortunate **security** incident that arose then, the way in which the armed forces were mobilised and the presentation of that mobilisation to the public was altogether too intrusive.

* This Bill represents a further complementary measure to the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organization Bill 1979.

* The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The Immigration Information Branch of the Australian Information Service prepared the booklet,  The Newcomer and the Law.

* The Department of Social **Security** became responsible for post-arrival services for migrants following the abolition of the former Department of Immigration in 1974 after work on the booklet had begun, and has therefore become nominally responsible for it.

* The booklet was published by the Australian Government Publishing Service for distribution by the Department of Social **Security**.

* Distribution began in January 1977 through offices of the Department of Social **Security**, Foreign language editions of the booklet are issued with a correction slip saying that the information on divorce and matrimonial matters no longer applies and announcing that a separate leaflet on the Family Law Act will be available soon.

* Distribution generally covered the following organisations: Employer organisations, Trade Unions, Social **Security** offices, Commonwealth Employment Service offices, police stations.

* By 4 April 1977, 83 500 copies of  The Newcomer and the Law  had been distributed by the Department of Social **Security**.

* My recollection of what occurred is that when Minsec ran into trouble a number of industrialists from abroad and from within Australia met with me, and arrangements were made for  a  considerable sum  of  money  to  be lent  to  Minsec, or  at  any  rate  to  be  used  so that  those creditors  of  Minsec who  held  shares in the Minsec's subsidiary companies as **security** could be paid off.

* This will not only give us some market **security** if overseas demand slackens, but provides a bargaining point in overseas negotiations for the reduction of trade barriers against rural imports.

* With the establishment of a smaller area, a more stringent permits procedure is to be introduced, for defence reasons, for **security** and for safety, to provide for the proper use of the reduced area.

* Very high **security** was maintained on the printing of this publication.

* By order of 23 June 1976 administration of that Act was allocated to the Minister for Social **Security**.

* As the amendments proposed to that Act refer to the Department of Social **Security**, it is appropriate that they should operate only from the date when that Department began to administer the legislation, that is, 23 June last.

* Did he, or any other Minister, order **security** to be tightened in relation to the safeguarding of Australian Service weapons.

* If so, does he regard the **security** appertaining earlier to be inadequate.

* Australian Industrial Court to be DirectorGeneral of **Security**;  Sir Owen  Dixon, then a Justice of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to the United States, and  Sir John  Latham while Chief Justice of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to Japan, the Government proposes to introduce legislation similar to that introduced on those other occasions to enable  Mr Justice  Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while AmbassadoratLarge.

* The fact of the matter is this: If one does not look at organisations and envisage them as being in due course led into a situation in which they can create problems then one does less than justice to the duties of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* Do they not understand that the welfare of their nation is protected directly in ratio to the significance of the national **security** organisation?

* Will he satisfy himself independently of Queensland Government agencies of the real concerns of Islanders in consultation with anthropologists and long-term residents of the islands whose **security** is not dependent on the goodwill or patronage of State officials.

* Do Excise regulations prohibit the brewing of commercial strength beer for home consumption without the payment of a substantial annual fee and **security**.

* What is the minimum fee and **security** levied.

* What is the maximum quantity of commercial strength beer which can be home brewed for personal consumption without the payment of excise and **security**.

* They talk about **security**.

* What **security** is there for a child in a school like North Fitzroy, Brunswick or Surry Hills?

* What **security** is there for a child growing up in a society where he is illequipped to cope with the sort of things that he will have to cope with?

* He said: 
The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The possibility of collecting statistics on Aboriginals in receipt of social **security** payments by means of an additional question on application forms is currently under examination.

* Statistics on the numbers of Aboriginals whose entitlement to social **security** pensions, benefits or allowances could be established if they applied are also not available.

* In the absence of data about the number of Aboriginals receiving social **security** payments and those whose entitlement to such payments could be established if they applied, it is not possible to provide the information requested.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
The other provisions of the Bill that require special mention are those relating to the protection of information that ought not, in the public interest, be publicly disclosed in proceedings before the Tribunal or as a result of having been produced, in confidence, to the Tribunal.

* Except where the certificate is given on the ground that the disclosure would prejudice **security**, defence or international relations or would disclose proceedings in Cabinet, an Attorney-General's certificate may be challenged before the Tribunal and may, if the Tribunal so rules, be set aside.

* -The Minister for Social **Security** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) The Department of Social **Security** does not knowingly grant pensions or benefits to persons who have entered Australia without an entry permit.

* As a consequence it would be exceptional if any Vietnamese people who originally came to Australia as 'unauthorised arrivals* are receiving Social **Security** benefits while not holding entry permits.

* He advocated consideration- that is all- of a proposition that the Federal Government should provide training schemes and pay allowances to 15 to 19-year olds who have left school and therefore should not be in receipt of social **security** benefits.

* The Australian Labor Party in 1973 allocated 20.4 per cent of our income to social **security** and welfare.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice, on 17 October 1979: 
1 ) What capital grants were made by the Depanment of Social **Security** for (a) the construction of and (b) improvements made to aged persons' homes in (i) New South Wales and (ii) Australia in each year since 1972-73.

* What capital grants were made by the Depanment of Social **Security** to (a) Woodbury Village, Lanhams Road, Winston Hills, and (b) Parklands Cottage Trust, Bells Line Road, Kurrajong, NSW in each year since 1972-73. 
asked the Minister for Social **Security**, upon notice: 
-I should like to raise 2 points this evening.

* One deals with the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation.

* It is most important that any **security** intelligence organisation clearly keeps away from interna) politics, if it has to exist at all.

* In view of the Australian **Security** Intelligence Organisation's report on the Warburton dynamite case and the references in it to Mudrinic.

* As I said earlier, the whole question of the treatment of social service pensioners and the matter of unemployment benefits have always been political footballs but at last we have a very responsible and conscientious Minister who has shown by his actions to date as Minister for Social **Security** that he has a genuine concern for the less fortunate in our society.

* Every action he has taken since being appointed Minister for Social **Security** has been towards relieving poverty and want within our society.

* I am sure that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  will be untiring in his efforts to make these promised changes and do away with the poverty that exists in our society.

* I conclude by once again congratulating the Minister for Social **Security** on the Bill which he has introduced.

* I hope that the Minister for Social **Security**  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will come into the chamber during the course of my speech because I have had them both told that I intend to say something reflecting upon the administration of their Departments.

* The Department of Social **Security** publishes figures monthly of the persons who are registered as unemployed and it also publishes figures monthly of the persons who are receiving unemployment benefits who are registered as unemployed.

* He wrote and so notified the Department of Social **Security** but the cheques kept coming.

* It is essential that our Defence Force is intellectually equipped to meet the challenges of the future to the **security** of this nation.

* a **security** issued by the Commission; 
the issue, redemption, transfer, sale or purchase of such a **security**, but excluding a transaction entered into without consideration or for an inadequate consideration; or
