## Contexts in which the word "crisis" was used in the hofreps during the 1940s

* I am as concerned with the coalmining dispute as I am with the international **crisis**.

* On the 1st August, 1940, the Melbourne  Herald  published a report that the Farmers' Debt Adjustment Board considered that 75 per cent, of Victoria's 13,000 wheat-growers were facing a financial **crisis** and that only from 5 per cent, to 7 per cent, were financially sound.

* The **crisis**' of 1931-35, when wages and invalid and old-age pensions, and all other social services were reduced, and hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the Commonwealth were thrown out of employment and had no wages at all, was the result of the unbridled control by private interests of the credit resources of this country.

* It may sound presumptuous for one to make that statement in the Australian Parliament, because Australia is only a small part of the world ; but the United States of America made a similar mistake in 1930, when, as one of the victors of World War I., instead of taking reparations in goods and allowing trade to flow a little more freely, it brought down the prohibitive Hawley-Smoot tariff, under which imports were cut in half, causing an intense economic **crisis** and drawing off half of the gold of the world.

* The appreciation of some Ministers of the **crisis** through which we are passing can be gauged by their belief that they should implement a peace-time policy suited to their own ends while they are in occupation of the treasury bench.

* The Commonwealth, in the present **crisis**, has failed to make as much use as might have been made of the States and municipalities.

* Faced as we are with a great international **crisis**, the fuel supplies of the nation are of paramount importance.

* If so, he had reached a **crisis** in his political life and, once having determined upon a certain course of action and crossed the dividing line, he is determined not to stop until he has completely socialized this country.

* Nearly all the craft unions have already been absorbed by the big industrial unions- 
I have a certain amount of sympathy for Ministers, but that sympathy is tinged with a great deal of disgust, for whilst they are sworn to uphold the law, when they are called upon to face up to a national- **crisis** of this kind they are recreant to the trust reposed in them.

* A conference of the nature I have in mind could be of material assistance to Great Britain in facing the present **crisis**.

* Therefore, our first duty towards helping Great Britain in this **crisis** is to step op production.

* by leave  - I appreciate being granted leave by the House to make a statement on the coal **crisis** because it is not the usual practice to intervene at question time with a statement.

* As a result of action taken by the Government thereafter, and by the great majority of the trade union movement, that great **crisis** was successfully surmounted.

* One wishes, in a time of **crisis** like this, that there were a little of that kind of courage among honorable members opposite.

* I remind honorable members that when the Pacific war **crisis** was at its height and we were threatened with invasion the " fourteen points " for constitutional reform set out by the Commonwealth Government were approved  by the Premiers and Leaders of the Opposition of all the States, and by the Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament.

* When the present Government took office, the late Prime Minister,  Mr. Curtin,  spoke in devastating phrases his thoughts of the coalminers and their actions at a time when Australia was facing the greatest **crisis** in its history.

* It is a truism that every **crisis** teaches some lesson.

* I believe that I understand the situation when I ask the Government to take into consideration the view that we have repeatedly put, and which the honorable member for Batman  (Mr. Brennan)  has properly stated, namely, that Parliament must be the masters of the Government in this **crisis**.

* We have passed through that **crisis**.

* Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Rill whereby the ravages of war and the aftermath of misery following this greatest **crisis** in history will bc alleviated to a great degree as the result of concerted action on the part of the United Nations to supply relief in the form of food and goods to all distressed people whether they are allied or enemy subjects.

* Every **crisis** has the effect of entrenching big concerns more strongly, and they will emerge, from the present war in a much more favorable position than they formerly occupied.

* It was part of the propaganda by which the Communists sought before the war to assure that if a **crisis** came this country would be defenceless.

* Honorable members opposite believe fervently in the right to strike, and that if they do anything in this **crisis** they would be denying workers the right  to  strike that they so' strongly support, and so 'be false to their innermost, convictions.

* Actually Australia has a credit balance of 3,000,000,000, but the Government refuses to use one penny of that amount to reduce the financial burden imposed upon us during the present **crisis**.

* Then he was appointed cartoonistin.,:11let for the Sydney  Daily Telegraph  and  Sunday Telegraph,  after two Australians had been dismissed because they would not produce cartoons filthy enough for the editors, when they were trying r,o break the late John Curtin's heart when he was trying to avert a coal **crisis**.

* In this enlightened age we are encouraging people to believe that in any **crisis** or difficulty there is no longer any need for them to fight or plan, but that all they have to do is to go to the nearest corner and hold out their hat and some' benevolent government will fill it for them.

* Another reason which has brought me to my feet is that this present **crisis** is giving new heart to the conscriptionists.

* Then in 1941, when Great Britain was facing the greatest **crisis** in its history, the coalition National Government, consisting of Conservative, Labour and Liberal parties, submitted the whole matter of social services to  Sir William,  now Lord, Beveridge, and asked him to prepare a report and make recommendations as to what should be done after the war had terminated.

* "We are told that, in its present **crisis**, Great Britain should be given first preference by Australia, but how can we in this country decide what ought to be done if we do not know what .

* In the  present hour of **crisis** the Government which is in control of the affairs of the nation is led by two right honorable gentlemen who are so committed, because of their previous history and actions, that they cannot take any effective action.

* During the **crisis**, the Leader of the Australian Country party had his usual battery of emotional words to offer, such as " The Government is weak-kneed," " The Government is dramatizing its handling of the coal strike," " The Government hesitated to stand up to Communist blackmail," and so on  ad infinitum  and  ad nauseam.

* The result of all these vicious, sectional, selfish and, in some respects, disloyal attacks on members of Parliament is to lower our prestige in the eyes of the people, to make them feel that they are leaning on rotten reeds in this time of **crisis**.

* We should reflect the wishes of the community, particularly in an hour of **crisis**, when the desire for co-operative effort in the prosecution of the war should be unanimous.

* We have heard a great deal from the Prime Minister  (Mr. Chifley),  the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction  (Mr. Dedman)  and honorable members who support the Government about the supposedly vital necessity for restricting Australia's imports of petrol in order to help Great Britain through its economic **crisis**.

* The Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems supported the existing structure of the Commonwealth Bank, and recommended that it be given wider powersin a time of national **crisis**.

* That thatorder has been obeyed is clear from the two bills relating to banking which are now before the 
I rose to take this opportunity to direct attention to what all honorable members and discerning people in Australia, particularly in Queensland, will regard as the apathy and absolute lack of responsibility of this Government in connexion with, the industrial **crisis** iii Queensland.

* a lockout or strike - 
Now, let us examine the Opposition's charge that the mere announcement of the Government's intention to nationalize the private banks has produced a business **crisis**.

* In view of the authoritative statements on the budget which have emanated from various parts of the chamber, it is with diffidence that I address myself to the manner in which the affairs of the country should be conducted in the present grave **crisis**.

* However, as hasbeen quite accurately pointed out, I shared in a recommendation that we should not take steps to amend the bill; in other words, that we should not create at this time a political **crisis** over the issue.

* On the export side, in 1938 Australia exported to Great Britain goods to the value of 71,800,000 ; in 1946, a year of grave **crisis** in Great Britain, we exported to that country good* valued at 67,700,000.

* There is a definite obligation upon us to play our part should a **crisis** occur, and I do not think that there is any one in this Parliament or elsewhere so devoid of imagination that he cannot visualize circumstances arising in which some nation hungry for power, territory or trade, would not once more plunge the world into disaster.

* However, it enjoyed the support of two independent members, who believed that, in the period of **crisis** for the freedom-loving peoples of the world, the Labour party was the only party that could be entrusted with the government of this country.

* Honorable members opposite have been charged with  the  responsibility of governing this country during  the  greatest **crisis** through which it has ever passed.

* "We are not passing through  an  economic **crisis**.

* He painted a picture that if the people took him at his word would indicate to them that we advocate a reduction of the aid that we should be giving to Great Britain in its economic **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister has applied himself to the task of' keeping the Labour movement intact throughout the present **crisis**; In previous crises since the Beginning of federation, the- movement- has been split asunder by disunity within its own ranks.

* in the 1 in order to obtain the wherewithal to tide it over a period of depression and **crisis**.

* The loss of production will accentuate our dollar shortage by causing, first, a decrease of our exports to Britain, which will worsen that country's dollar **crisis**; secondly, a decrease of our exports to dollar countries, which will worsen our own dollar shortage; and thirdly, an increase of the importation from dollar countries of essential goods that should be produced here.

* I should like to see the cablegrams which passed between the British and Australian 'Governments at the time of tlie Munich **crisis**, and also on the subject of the abandonment of Czechoslovakia.

* In this time of national **crisis**, the expenditure of the States should be curtailed as much as possible, in order that every available 1 shall be expended on our war effort, which is the only matter of real importance at the moment.

* .- Clause 29 should be divided into two parts, one dealing with the ordinary conditions that operate in peace-time when there is not a **crisis**, and the other applying only in an emergency.

* Indeed, from the limited study that I have been able to make, the bill appears to me to contain very stingest provisions in deed to deal at least with the financial aspect of the present **crisis**.

* Every historian emphasizes that this **crisis** was due to the fact that political and not financial considerations dictated the banking policy of the country.

* Then, if the rate of exchange falls, we shall have most difficult adjustments to make, and perhaps we shall have a major **crisis** similar to that of the depression years.

* In this period of unprecedented **crisis**, we must organize, not only our fighting forces, but also the total resources of the Commonwealth, in order to save Australia from the invader.

* Whilst I do not suggest that the **crisis** in Victoria today is comparable with war-time conditions, it is a most serious state of affairs indeed.

* I regret that Great Britain also is being hampered by industrial unrest in its efforts to meet its present **crisis**.

* Those who looked upon Germany with some degree of doubt hushed their fears lest they should raise unnecessary alarm or precipitate a **crisis**.

* While that lag operates there is always a danger of a major economic **crisis** being brought about by the Government's policy.

* It can rather be regarded as a statement of accounts, a statement of the largest accounts ever experienced in the history of Australia, and produced in their turn by the greatest **crisis** this country has ever had to confront.

* When he considered that it was necessary for him to take action in the recent **crisis**, he threw troops into service on the coal-fields.

* Its financial stability has been so precarious that wheat-growers, when beset by any **crisis**, large or small, have been obliged to appeal to governments for assistance.

* Australia is in a critical situation; but, as the result of the activities of the present Government, the situation is less critical to-day than it was when the Government assumed office, simply because the country is in a much better position to meet a **crisis**.

* I recognize that, in the present **crisis**, these matters could be better discussed at a secret meeting, but the position is desperate.

* Whether that is so or not, we do not know; but we do know from what the Prime Minister said that  Mr. Morrison  is very dissatisfied with the response of the men to his decisions, and that as the result a **crisis** has been caused involving the tying up of 70 vessels in Sydney at present.

* I did not consider that during a period of national **crisis** that was sufficient reason to hold up work at the pit, but I did not accept the newspaper version of the trouble.

* In the ultimate **crisis**, no government, .regardless of its political complexion, can wash its hands of a matter such as this.

* Surely in these days of **crisis** such issues are not sufficient to justify the dismissal of a government from office, and its replacement by members of a party which at best has not a majority in either branch of the legislature !

* At a time like the present, when everybody in the world is looking for stability, we should retain what has proved eminently successful during a financial **crisis**.

* They are seeking to create in the minds of the people of Australia the impression that the present Government cannot be trusted in a time of international **crisis**.

* In this case, though the men concerned at the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's works are not seeking to gain advantages for themselves, they have been instructed by the union to precipitate what must amount to a terrible **crisis** in the canning fruits  industry.

* in a. time- of war or- other **crisis**, they have found it.

* When the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies)  was Prime Minister he visited the northern coal-fields, but the present Prime Minister  (Mr. Curtin)  did not even lift a little finger to assist him during the **crisis** experienced at that time.

* In normal circumstances, I should be opposed to this proposal, on the ground that it is uneconomic; but at a time of great **crisis** for the nation, when all of its man-power and capital is required to prosecute its war.

* This period of **crisis** is no time for recriminations such as the honorable member for Dalley  (Mr. Rosevear)  vented.

* The hardest struggle in leadership, or in any responsible position, is the making of decisions of a vital character in times of **crisis**.

* Whatever difficulties may be looming ahead, it behoves the Government to be careful in its public announcements, lest it precipitate the very **crisis** which it wishes to avoid.

* The only time that the issue arose and provoked a **crisis** of a temporary nature was in 1929 when the late  Senator Barnes  proposed a policy of preference to returned soldiers in regard to some pick and shovel jobs in the Home Affairs Department or some other department.

* Why should any government in this time of difficulty and international **crisis** be concerned with anything but a desire to protect the interests of Australia?

* It is the hope of the Government that the national unity evolved by the present **crisis** will bring in another and even more fruitful period of social progress.

* I agree with the honorable member for Barker  (Mr. Archie Cameron)  and the honorable member for Richmond  (Mr. Anthony)  that, in view of this **crisis**, Parliament should not be permitted to adjourn to-morrow.

* During the nine years that this Government and similar governments have been in office, the policies of the nation have been shaped by the influence of the private banking institutions, with the result that thousands of men were denied the opportunity to prepare Australia for the great **crisis** through which it is now passing.

* I am not confident that men like them, will not abuse  their powers in a **crisis**, particularly if working class interests are involved.

* Also, it should protect borrowers, because we must remember that, although a minor **crisis** may not cause the insolvency of the banks, it may place borrowers in an invidious position.

* I do suggest, therefore, that, as an indication that in this tremendous **crisis** which confronts Australia, we shall behave as citizens acting together, the Government will say, "Because we do desire to act in concert with the trade-union movement, we will act in consultation with it."

* Those who can best unite the people are their leaders at the moment of **crisis**.

* However, as soon as we have pulled through the production **crisis**, we shall be confronted with another.

* I am sure that the people of Australia, generally, knowing something of the disasters which befell the industry in the past, will be only too pleased to assist it in time of **crisis** by making up the deficiency in the stabilization fund to enable the grower to he paid the guaranteed home-consumption price of  6s.

* Honorable members are aware of what happened during the bank **crisis** of 1893, when thirteen banks closed their doors and withheld payment from their unfortunate depositors.

* In a great national **crisis** the people have to turn to the Labour party, but I warn them of the aftermath of war.

* I sincerely trust that in this grave **crisis** all sections of the people will stand together.

* The continuing world food **crisis** was an item on the agenda of the conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization.

* In the throes of the worst war and the greatest **crisis** through which the Empire has passed, a government that has no mandate from the people, but occupied the treasury bench upon the defeat of the previous Administration on its budget proposals, and representing barely 50 per cent, of the people of this country, has the temerity to bring forward a measure that is vital to.

* It is regrettable that at this time of **crisis** the great profiteering companies and combines are not compelled to contribute their fair share of the revenues of this country.

* We want to avoid economic problems which have assumed **crisis** dimensions in other countries.

* That is one skeleton in the cupboard that the banks would like to forget- the financial **crisis** of 1S93.

* "We are facing a grave **crisis** and I say to the Prime Minister that we want strength and decisive action on the part of the Government.

* Would the Commonwealth Bank, particularly in a **crisis**, finance speculative enterprises or luxury trades?

* Yet, in this time of great **crisis** the Treasurer merely tells us that, in particular, it was thought that the central aim of all countries should be to have a single multilateral system in which goods flow freely and dollars are easily convertible to sterling.

* In Victoria we are faced with an industrial **crisis** verging on a national calamity.

* It reflects great credit on the Government that in a time of national **crisis** it has introduced legislation that will have the effect of making the Commonwealth a better place to live in, and a country to which the members of our fighting forces will be proud to return.

* during Australia's **crisis**.

* When the **crisis** occurred in New Caledonia, it was surmounted successfully because of the loyalty of the Free French in New Caledonia, and their determination to take a stand -quite different from that which the Vichy French took in Indo-China.

* Honorable members will remember that it was about that time that the **crisis** occurred in connexion with the alterations in our arbitration system that the Bruce-Page Government was bringing down, and which the right honorable member for North Sydney  (Mr. Hughes)  seized upon as a fitting occasion to pay off a series of old scores.

* However, the dollar **crisis** has arisen and we do not know what conditions may develop from day to day.

* The speech which the Prime Minister has made this afternoon will be of little comfort to the tens of thousands of citizens who are looking to the Government for a lead in the present **crisis**.

* When a **crisis** arises, honorable members opposite cry, " Send for the A.W.U."

* I think that one of the root-causes of the present **crisis** in this industry is that each side is anxious about the post-war years.

* There had already been indications that decisions in relation to the dollar **crisis** has been lodged against us.

* Labour seems to secure office at times of great national **crisis**, as a result of the intrigue of its political opponents.

* That is true, but  we  have lively recollections of the way in which market values of Commonwealth bonds have fluctuated in periods of **crisis**.

* It is freely acknowledged - and I would be the last to deny it - that we are under an obligation to assist Great Britain in the economic **crisis** confronting it; but if restrictions are to be imposed on imports from dollar areas, we should bear in mind that many of the restrictions which we impose upon ourselves will not be compensated for by the import of goods from Great Britain.

* It may be assumed, therefore, that it is only in time of **crisis**, such as war or an economic depression, that there would be any need for a reserve at all, and we invariably find that, at such a time, the legal provisions for stabilizing the currency are suspended.

* On the subject of the note issue R. G. Hawtrey, a high official in the British Treasury, and a lecturer in economics, wrote as follows in a book which has become a standard work of reference in Australia - 
One of the gravest features of the present **crisis** in Great Britain is the defeatist attitude that has been developed regarding it.

* He over-estimated the patriotism of one section, which, unfortunately, was able to precipitate a minor **crisis** in the every-day business life of the community.

* I, do not wish to act vindictively against any enemy alien because he happens to be in our midst; but we should sterilize any opportunity he may have, if he so desires, to do damage to this country in a moment of **crisis**.

* Then, when a financial **crisis** threatened the country, money would be available to meet the emergency.

* Australia is facing just as great a **crisis** now as it did in 1941-42.

* No financial or national **crisis** makes imperative the passage of the bill in the time proposed.

* This is a time of **crisis**.

* I ask for an increase of the basic wage because it is the desire of both the Government and the Opposition that there shall be a maximum national effort in the present **crisis**.

* Despite the international **crisis**.

* Because America and England came to our rescue during the **crisis**, they feel now that they must play a part in global defence, but, not being willing to bring the youth of Australia to a sense of responsibility, they must depend on others -particularly the scientists, to help them out of their difficulty and give them.

* There was a stalemate, and it looked as if a national **crisis** would develop.

* This system may be satisfactory for exportable commodities, but for non-exportable commodities, such- as maize, it is impossible to organize any Commonwealth system of marketing, with the result that there is cut-throat competition between the States in times of **crisis**, such as drought, and there is no authority, either State or Commonwealth, which can prevent it.

* Australia has passed through the most dangerous **crisis** in its history, and has emerged stronger than ever.

* Who will say that those industries have not been completely successful and of very great value, not only to Tasmania but also to Australia as a whole, in the **crisis** through which we are passing?

* There is a family **crisis** now when the husband needs a new suit.

* I have offered my own services in a purely honorary capacity at any time when I can do anything to help the nation through this terrible **crisis**.

* If the amendment had been accepted in the proper spirit, and the Government had made some attempt to meet our requests, the present **crisis**;, which has arisen over the budget, would have been averted.

* It is reasonable to suppose that a threat to world food production is foreshadowed by the atomic bomb, which doubtless will become even more devastating as more money is made available for its development, and this may cause a world food **crisis** in a much shorter time than 70 years.

* We desire only your service, your skill, your experience, to be used to the best advantage of Australia in the greatest **crisis** in the history of Australia ".

* The second point arises from the present world food **crisis**, and the action necessary by governments to meet it.

* Every one has sympathy for tie tradesmen who must be displaced in the present **crisis**; but we also have sympathy for the families which have been broken up when men have joined the fighting forces.

* If, by the use of steam-roller tactics, the Government intends to have these provisions enacted, and eventually to take over the coal-mines, it should not first ruin the industry, but should at least give to those whose money is invested in it and who have done a good job for this country in a time of **crisis** the opportunity to obtain a fair return.

* I ask honorable members not to be moved by sudden floods of emotion or fear in this **crisis**.

* So member countries are stripped of their only means of defence in a time of financial and economic **crisis**.

* The fact that he stepped down from the Bench to serve his country during a time of grave **crisis** showed that he placed the interests of the nation before his own.

* Some time ago, a man was charged with the murder of 
As was inevitable at the conclusion of  a  national **crisis**, there were large quantities of stores of all kinds in hired buildings, as well as in drill halls, and other buildings, which had, in war, no activities of the kind for which they had been built, namely the assembly, training and administration of Citizen Force units.

* The operation of the central bank will be much more satisfactory if that institution is not " cluttered up " with other activities An essential function of a central bank is to keep its funds fluid, so that it may assist all banking as quickly as possible if a **crisis** arises.

* If there is a **crisis** the British Government's first action  is to summon Parliament.

* If this Parliament is clothed with power to legislate in relation to terms and conditions of employment in industry it might, however, in an appropriate case have to intervene in some great .**crisis**.

* Secondly, I refer to a statement which the Minister for Trade and Customs made last night to a meeting of a sub-committee of Cabinet which considered the dollar **crisis**.

* A few weeks ago, the American Secretary of State, General Marshall, described the situation as " very, very serious " and declared that we were in the midst of a great **crisis**.

* Now they are shedding crocodile tears during the greatest **crisis** in the history of the nation.

* It is true that fantastic prices are obtained for gold, par- ticularly from refugees, who had some harrowing experiences with the currencies of various countries, and who now like to obtain gold., because they can be sure that, in the event of another **crisis**, it will be readily saleable in any part of.

* The country was faced with a **crisis**, the enemy was upon us, and defeat would have meant our subjection to probably the most fanatical race that the world has ever known.

* Honorable members opposite are entitled to their own opinions, and members of the Opposition have every right to differ from them ; but, when the Government and its supporters impute unworthy motives to the Opposition, their action is not conducive to unity of purpose in this great **crisis**.

* The action taken by the Government to meet the dollar **crisis**  i9  extremely unlikely to bring about the golden age about which the Prime Minister spoke so glibly last year ; rather will it bring about a depression.

* But I would remind them that had this nation depended on private enterprise to organize the country for war, we would not have accomplished one fraction of the marvellous war effort achieved in this grave **crisis**.

* It is imperative that we produce our requirements of cotton at all times, whether in peace or in war, so that during a period of  **crisis**  we shall be assured of supplies which will enable us to conduct our war operations effectively.

* I believe that a regulation of this kind is necessary in the present **crisis**, and I also consider that the Minister's approach to industrial disputes has been successful.

* I am prompted to refer to it, because of the statement by the honorable member for Indi  (Mr. McEwen)  that the Minister for Transport  (Mr. Ward)  and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  (Mr. Scully)  should confer as to whether transport facilities could be improved, in order to meet the immediate **crisis**.

* We should have the sorry spectacle of the Government being dissolved, and of our going to the country in a time of **crisis**, with the J apanese massing on islands to the north of our continent, and an invasion possible.

* I remind the honorable member that one of the other features of those speeches was the emphasis that was placed upon the necessity for unity in this **crisis** in our history.

* It bears on the front page the words " Australia faces a **crisis**  I"  underneath which are the words " Censored : "Workers' Press ".

* In view of the national **crisis** that is rapidly descending upon the community because of the threatened coal strike, has the Prime Minister yet decided to accept the offer made by the Leader of the Opposition to facilitate the passage of any legislation that may be necessary?

* **crisis** will last.

* In view of the present grave state of emergency arising from the coal **crisis**, and in view of the Prime Minister's statement that available petrol supplies must bc restricted to ensure their equitable distribution, is the carriage of race-horses by TransAustralia Airlines justified at the present juncture, and is the use of petrol for this purpose in accord with government policy?

* I understand that  Mr. Olive  Turnbull, in his column entitled "Free Speech", freely criticized the actions of the Hollway-McDonald Government in Victoria in regard to the Essential Services Act, and that the management of the Melbourne  Herald  exercised its well-known powers of censorship to suppress any criticism of the Hollway-McDonald Government's actions in that period of **crisis**.

* During the serious **crisis** through which the nation is now passing every benefit which one section of the community has over another must be surrendered in the interests of total war.

* We are not considering what may happen under the operation of this substitute commission system in an atmosphere of abstract debate ; we are considering the proposal in an atmosphere of **crisis** in which there is defiance of an award of an existing commissioner in Victoria by powerful unions, presumably against the will of this Government, and, certainly, against the will of the Government of Victoria.

* I am surprised that the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems did not more closely investigate the banking **crisis** of 1S93.

* The statement of the managers of the various banks which defaulted at that time hardly touched on the issue, and the  report of the commission itself mentioned the **crisis** only in passing.

* Jauncey refers to the banking **crisis** in these terms - 
During the **crisis** (1S03), twelve banks, having 905 branches throughout Australia, with aggregate liabilities of over 100,000,000, suspended payment.

* The story of the policy of repudiation practised by the bank following the 1893 **crisis** was ventilated in the Legislative Council by  Mr. Ryan,  who, amongst other things, explained that, during the **crisis**, the Dibbs Government passed the Bank 
.- The people of Australia will be disappointed, and in Victoria will be disgusted, at the blunt rejection of the amendment that has been submitted by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies),  which would place in the hands of the Government the power to avoid the **crisis** that is upon us.

* We are confronted with a **crisis** greater than any that has been experienced in- a century.

* It would he invaluable to farmers and pastoralists in the present **crisis**.

* in  reply  - I endorse fully the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies)  regarding the service that has been rendered to Australia by its citizens during the great **crisis** of the war,' to a large degree under the authority of the act which is to be terminated on the 31st December next.

* Notwithstanding that **crisis**, the right honorable gentleman stated that he would not introduce conscription for service overseas without again consulting the people.

* The **crisis** which arose following the entry of Japan into the war made it necessary to suspend almost entirely normal home-building, public works, and factory building.

* There was no grave national or economic **crisis**.

* I do not disagree with the general purport of his remarks that the best brains in the community should be used in the service of the country in a time of unprecedented **crisis**, and that every body who is anxious and willing to serve should be found a position in the service of the nation.

* published by the Herald and Weekly Times Limited-, Melbourne, and something that I read yesterday on the front page of the Melbourne  Sun-Pictorial,  which told the story of the **crisis** in 
I am pleased that the Prime Minister  (Mr. Curtin)  intends to call Parliament together again on the 25th of this month.

* I consider that, in a time of war and **crisis**, the Parliament in a democracy is not the effective instrument that it is in peace-time.

* .- I very much regret that Parliament should be required to discuss a bill of this kind at a time of Empire **crisis**.

* Our people face momentous issues, and we are confronted by the gravest **crisis** in our history.

* Surely they would not be so foolish as to advocate that a referendum should be held in  this period of national **crisis**.

* Their gratitude is in striking contrast to the attitude of the Opposition which is trying to make political capital out of, the position and are trying to deride Australia's national effort in the **crisis** through which the world is passing.

* Ever since this war began I have maintained that the duties devolving upon a government increase greatly in time of national **crisis**.

* Ministers, that the matter is one which affects not only the persona i safety of members of this Parliament, but also the positions that they hold in the parliamentary machinery for the government of Australia in its hour of **crisis**.

* In this period of **crisis**, all materials and services must be at the command of the Commonwealth, which has to mass and organize them for the purpose of defending the country.

* During the war years and since, time and time again we have witnessed the spectacle of the Government granting authority to a commission to carry out certain functions only to find that in time of **crisis** it has failed to uphold the deci- .

* The people will look to this Parliament for a real measure of justice to men who have sacrificed their peace-time pursuits to meet Australian and world needs in this great **crisis** which we all hope will end at an early date.

* The subject chosen by  Mr. Ross  for his lecture is "The Coal Crisis; Its Cause and Cure".

* This enormous expenditure will be incurred at a time when the Prime Minister is speaking of the dollar **crisis**, import licences are being called in, and the importation of necessary motor cars and other goods is being reduced'.

* Obviously, the right honorable gentleman and his supporters are prepared to go to great lengths in an effort to displace this Government, which was elected because, when they were in office, they failed dismally whenever the nation was faced wilh a **crisis**.

* The Russians are determined to create a **crisis** in Berlin by force of arms.

* In the present **crisis**, the country should be pulling together in perfect unity.

* In any event, he creates uncertainty and dissension, and so does a disservice to the community in this **crisis**.

* Some of the State Premiers have already issued a grave warning that their treasuries will soon face a financial **crisis**.

* If this issue were put to the people even during the present **crisis** - of which the man in the street is fully aware - it would be most definitely rejected.

* It will be noted that the relations between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks have always been most' friendly, and this opportunity is taken to  express  appreciation oi the cordial co-operation of the latter during the  severe  **crisis** through which the world has passed in recent years.

* Within the Empire, the man-power of Great Britain, and subsequently of the dominions, has always known how to play its part when it came to a real **crisis**.

* To assist the people of Great Britain in their desperate economic **crisis**, which, according to figures published in to-day's press, is worsening, I ask the Minister what steps, if any, have been taken to reduce the consumption of meat in excess of the ration scale in this country?

* The Labour party is in favour of mobilizing the credit of the country and using it for and on behalf of the people, both during a period of war **crisis** and under conditions of normal development.

* The **crisis** that now lowers over the industry is the inevitable climax to their maladministration.

* We had such a **crisis** in the depression.

* At page 90 of hisbook he says - 
.- This bill is for the purpose of granting ti  0,000,000  to Great Britain to assist 1 lint country in its present economic **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister also referred to the economic **crisis** through which that country is passing, and stressed that it is the duty, and indeed, the privilege of Australia, to make a contribution to the Mother Country at this time.

* The problem of aid to Great Britain in its present economic **crisis** poses the question of the quality as well as the quantity of the aid that this country, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, ought to give to the British people.

* I believe, and I think my view is shared by the Prime Minister and almost every honorable member of this house, that in this **crisis** we stand or fall together.

* I went, as a private member, for the specific purpose of trying to gather information from sources in the British Commonwealth, and particularly Great Britain, on how best we can help the British people in their **crisis**, and, by conversations with public men and others in that country, to discover what we can do to get closer together.

* The **crisis** through which the British people are passing is not one that has suddenly descended upon them.

* Some of us think of what we call the dollar **crisis** of the United Kingdom Government as something extraordinary, accidental and new.

* revolution developed in the United Kingdom and changed  Lt  from a primary producing country to a country with great secondary industries, and **crisis** with which it is now faced began to develop.

* Hence, there has arisen what we call the dollar **crisis**.

* This problem, which has now developed into a roaring **crisis**, was brought to a head by the violent impact of two world wars upon the British economic system.

* All of these circumstance have created a **crisis** which nobody could have contemplated and which has put Great Britain in a more economically unsound and disordered position than it has ever been in before or, please God, will ever be in again.

* Upon the premise with which I began my speech, I say that we stand or fall together in this **crisis**.

* I have mentioned that incident in order to indicate that the courage and resolution of the British people in this **crisis** have been nothing less than superb.

* I am treating this, not as a matter of external affairs or the relations between the various units of the British Commonwealth, but as a matter of Australia's specific relations with Great Britain in a specific **crisis**.

* Bay without being unduly egotistical, has in this **crisis** in Australia's history done a wonderful job, as is recognized by many people throughout the Commonwealth.

* An emergency gift of 12,000 tons of food conveyed in this way would be a gesture both to Britain and to the world that Australia intends to help Britain meet its **crisis**, but it should be followed up by a vigorous policy which would expand shipments over and above those already contemplated in current programmes.

* We can never say that we are on top of the situation, but each **crisis** will be met as it arises.

* In relation to the strength of the defence services, I understand that the Army, particularly, is much better prepared to take part in a **crisis**, should one emerge, than it was ever before.

* It has a stronger conviction now than ever that in this time of dire national **crisis** we cannot do all that is required of us unless we do something to establish this industry in Australia forthwith.

* Can you please tell me what I can do to personally help this country in the severe **crisis** through which it is now passing?

* To date the severity of the Australian housing shortage has led us to' concentrate our attention on arrangements for the building of new dwellings, and little has been said about slum clearance; This is regrettable but necessary, becausein a housing **crisis** of the dimensions of that now on our hands, it would be folly to pull down houses on a large scale, except those which actually cause disease or danger to life.

* The men composing the corps gave up their weekends to it, and during the worst **crisis** of the war were prepared' to drill and make themselves available to the armed forces of the Commonwealth, wherever they might be required.

* The advertisement read - 
I ask the Prime Minister whether his Government intends to follow the course proposed by the Government of the United Kingdom, namely, to take over and control all industries connected with the manufacture of war materials and munitions, as well as banking, in view of his statement yesterday in regard to the serious **crisis** which faces Australia and the British Commonwealth of Nations generally?

* Australia is passing through the greatest **crisis** in its history, and it has done very well up to the present in putting a progressive social security programme into operation ; but I should like the Government to  introduce  a measure for the purpose of placing on the statute.book a social security act embracing all of the social legislation which has been passed and into which the whole of our future .

* Australia's war-time capacity to meet the **crisis** started years before the war began; yet the present Government claims the credit for Australia's achievements, instead of giving some of the credit to its predecessors.

* This bill has united the Government and the Opposition whereas the great issues confronting the country in this time of **crisis** have failed to do so.

* This mission was concerned primarily with the dollar **crisis**, but no report on the subject has been made to this Parliament.

* This aim cannot be achieved by having - as was the case in the past - half a dozen separate authorities in an area the defence of which should be a joint responsibility - that is to say, a matter for joint consultation, joint collaboration, and the assurance of mutual support in times of **crisis**.

* The demands of the war have had a serious effect upon the production of all kinds of foodstuffs, and, unless we take great care, a grave **crisis** will occur in the dairying industry.

* the following statement by the Acting Commonwealth Statistician  (Mr. S. R. Carver)  was published in the newspapers :  - 
Even twelve months after the **crisis** had passed, tactics were being employed by the spokesmen of the Opposition that were similar to those used by them when the Prime Minister first made his appeal to the United States of America to come to the help of Australia in its hour of need.

* Throughout the **crisis** in Queensland I sent telegrams to the Minister for Works and 
The Prime Minister is making an appeal to workers for greater production.

* This **crisis** caused- industry to be starved of.

* I emphasize that the object of restricting the raising of capital in Australia is to prevent investments on unnecessary enterprises during the present **crisis**.

* It concerns Australia's conception of the kind of government it should have in a time of danger, when **crisis** is close at- hand.

* The Scullin Labour Government realized that the only way to meet the **crisis** was to put national works in hand as soon as possible in order to offset the rapidly growing unemployment.

* That almost, created a **crisis** in the midst of war.

* If we want a real war effort, many of the Government's friends who are now living merely on the unearned increment provided by the labour of other people, should do a little manual labour, in factories or elsewhere, on behalf of the nation in this **crisis**.

* Time will not permit me to cover events leading up to the Berlin **crisis**, or the rights and wrongs associated with the Berlin position; but it is true that it was not a Labour government in either Australia or Great Britain which gave Russia the zones of influence it occupies to-day.

* I had hoped that the Commonwealth sought this power so that it could exercise it only in time of **crisis**.

* A blanket prohibition, as envisaged under this clause, could do the gravest harm and should be imposed only in periods of national **crisis**.

* In an emergency Parliament could be hastily summoned to deal with not only this matter but every other aspect of the **crisis**.

* Indeed in a **crisis** Parliament, should sit almost continually.

* There ought to be two provisions, one to meet a **crisis** and the other the more or less normal conditions in which there will be ups and downs but plenty of time in which to arrive at the proper decision.

* In the early part of next year, this country will face a period of unemployment and industrial **crisis** comparable with that which it had to face in the early stages of the war of 1914-18.

* As industry, due to the economic **crisis**, was reduced to a low ebb, it was a comparatively simple matter for the capitalists to secure all the coal they needed from the pits that remained at work.

* The present banking legislation before the Commonwealth Parliament owes its origin directly to the fact that previous Commonwealth Governments found that, in times of **crisis**, they were unable to enforce their will on those who control Australia's banking system.

* In this period of unprecedented **crisis**, theGovernment is publishing numerous regulations, and honorable members experience great difficulty in ascertaining, for the purpose of investigating complaints, the identity of the persons who are authorized to carry out the instructions contained therein.

* Discussion took place over the proposed Italian immigrants and the following motion was carried unanimously: That owing to the acute shortages of labour existing in outback mines and for cutting firewood supplies, and the importance of goldmining in the present economic **crisis**, the sub-branch supported the introduction of suitable Italian workers into the industry, as they would not be displacing Australians who evidently did not want to engage in mining.

* Has the Australian Government actively interested itself in the present European political **crisis** beyond the maintenance of the normal functions of its High Commissioner in London?

* The honorable member for Boothby  (Dr. Price)  suggested that the changes in the constitutional relationships of the Dominions  inter se  affected the solidarity of the Empire in times of **crisis**.

* But we have added to that something equally important, and that is the kinship which now binds the peoples together, and binds them together for ever so that in the greatest **crisis** of history, the people of Australia are as one with the people of Great Britain.

* I remind the honorable member that Australia is now passing through a **crisis** unprecedented in its history.

* The speech was typical of many from honorable members opposite, to which we on this side of the chamber have listened; but bitter experience has shown that private enterprise has been found wanting whenever a **crisis** has faced this nation.

* Will the Prime Minister take action to increase the weekly shipments in order to avert another fuel **crisis** in Victoria this Christmas?

* An industrial **crisis** is in many ways like a shipwreck.

* In an industrial **crisis**, it is the first Arms that become involved that can secure the readiest assistance of the banks.

* If there is no shortage of foodstuffs, then there is no argument to support the release of men from the fighting forces, but, if, on the other  hand,  a serious **crisis** is developing in food production and is being intensified every week and every month, it is up to us to examine the whole question now, so that an estimate may be made of the position that will obtain in a year or two years should the present drift continue.

* In other words, the paramount importance of the war and its administrative problems was felt to necessitate some give and take if Parliament were not to proceed from one **crisis** to another, with all the dangerous interruption to administration which such a state of affairs would produce.

* Has the Prime Minister seen the editorial in the Sydney'  Daily Telegraph  to-day in which it is stated that the coalowners are also guilty men in the coal **crisis** because of their failure to take action under  the Coal Industry Act to prosecute the officials of the miners federation who are responsible for stoppages and strikes in the industry?

* They are governments which honorable members of the Opposition will, I think, admit did an excellent job for the country during the great **crisis** of war, a **crisis** which threatened our territorial integrity and the safety of our people, and their war-time record has been followed by a process of economic reconstruction which must stand as one of the most satisfactory in the world.

* Yet, under the present economic system we have passed through periods of **crisis**, which have been accompanied by unemployment and starvation, while the stores have been bursting with the commodities that have been needed to sustain human life; but because they could not be disposed of profitably, they were destroyed.

* Honorable gentlemen opposite have spoken at some length about the political background ofsome of the present members of the Commonwealth Bank Board; but, as the Treasurer has observed, this Government, in a time of unprecedented **crisis** involving financial operations of unexampled magnitude, has been able to do all that it desired to do without any serious disagreement with the board.

* We must also demonstrate that, in this **crisis**, we are ready, resolutely and willingly, to throw everything that we have into the battle for our existence.

* The British Government had about 600,000,000 sterling in gold reserves when the **crisis** occurred.

* This involves no real criticism of the existing organization, and, in particular, of the existing Controller-General, but is merely another proof of thefact that an instrument forged in time of peace may prove to be inadequate in time of war, and particularly in time of **crisis** during war.

* Critics of the bill have declared that the Commonwealth's proposal will restrict the power of the States to impose taxation, but in this period of grave **crisis**, State taxation is inhibiting the Commonwealth.

* Ever since the first month, the Government has been progressing from one **crisis** to another, and from one mud hole to another.

* Some sort of internal **crisis** seems to have taken place in Japan at the week-end of the 29th-30th November.

* I query the motives of some members of the Opposition, at any rate, because when I look at the record of honorable members opposite when they were supporters of an anti-Labour government, and the food **crisis** in Great Britain was just as bad as it is to-day- 
.- I am glad to find that it is possible for the committee this afternoon to debate the merits of the Senate's amendment in a calm and rational manner.

* Towards the end of last week there appeared to be a desire on the part of the Government to invest it with an atmosphere of **crisis**, and to associate with it the suggestion that this.

* Australia is probably approaching another wool **crisis**.

* I give credit to the right honorable member for North Sydney  (Mr. Hughes)  for the way in which he met the **crisis** in the wool industry after the last war.

* It is certain that the economic **crisis** at present apparent in Great Britain and European countries will have its effect on the economic position of citizens of this country.

* All the elaborate superstructure - which attempts to create a super world state is being erected in the same state of **crisis**.

* We sponsor the partition of Palestine between the Arabs and the Jews; we object to what the Americans are doing in Korea; we are ready to jump into the middle of the Antarctic **crisis**.

* The Minister for External Affairs, as  President  of the United Nations Assembly, will have the difficult task of presiding over the deliberations of the Assembly while it is considering the Berlin **crisis**.

* If it is treated thus, in view of the known facts - the scarcity of tradesmen and others, the peril of the Empire, the proper relationship of things and the **crisis** in world affairs - we shall proceed with first things first, and build aircraft, ships and armaments, which are more urgently needed than' are motor cars.

* When I review the unfortunate history of wheat production in Australia, and consider what governments were in power  in the  period unguardedly mentioned by the honorable member for Indi, when the wheat industry was in  a  state of depression, due  to  seasonal conditions  and  other adverse factors, I  ask  myself whether  or  not the facts reveal that the' honorable member, or the government which  he  supported, took  any  practical steps comparable with those  that  have been taken by this Government  in a  war  **crisis**,  to lift the grower from a condition of poverty  to  one  of  comparative affluence.

* In times of **crisis** and of war Australia has acquitted itself well.

* I hope that the Government will take steps to organize road transport facilities for the transport of stock to the maximum degree, and to this end will ensure that any regulations which may tend to limit the fullest use of this form of transport - I am not referring to petrol rationing - will be relaxed until the present **crisis** has passed, so that the greatest possible relief may be given.

* behalf of the Government, give the House an assurance that the Parliament will be kept continuously in session during the present grave **crisis** in the nation's affairs, due to the coal strike, and that the Parliament will be given an opportunity to discuss, and, if necessary, to deal with the strike position each week?

* Is it not a fact that violent opposition has developed throughout the entire Labour movement in Australia, and that this opportunist, the Minister for Labour and National Service, capitalized this opposition by turning against the Prime Minister and the interests of his country at this time of **crisis**?

* The Government, apparently, is not anxious to tell us what it proposes to do during the present **crisis**.

* The Government may take the view that, in a **crisis**, people must be prepared to accept a bitter pill.

* He pointed out that a strike would cause a national **crisis** and would probably involve thousands of workers in loss of employment and deal a shattering blow to the trade unions and the Labour movement in Australia.

* Subsequently, in a statement published by the Communist party, the non-Communist parties were accused of subversive tendencies and of provoking a **crisis** which was a threat to the security of the Republic.

* They declare that thanks to a **crisis** artificially and deliberately provoked certain methods already exploited elsewhere have been used to bring about the suspension of free parliamentary institutions and the establishment of a disguised dictatorship of a single party under the cloak of a government of national union.

* I do not regard  Mr.  Penton's  service in Australia as indispensable to this country in the present **crisis**.

* The progress already made in tariff negotiations and the decision by a substantial number of the governments to bring tariff reductions into provisional effect lay a sound basis for successful achievement of a significant improvement in world trading conditions and for a solution of the present economic **crisis**.

* If, even during the war, in the midst of a national **crisis**, the States wished to control patriotic funds, what justification is there now, when the war is over, for the Commonwealth retaining control over them?

* I have listened, to a long dis:sertation by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Forde),  and am amazed at the advice that is tendered by one who refuses- to accept any responsibility.. For a long time, I have advocated that the party which sits opposite should join with us and do all that it can to assist us in this great **crisis**.

* I do not concede that the business of this country, in the **crisis** with which we are faced to-day, can be satisfactorily settled at a secret meeting.

* In view of the latest reports of the economic **crisis** in Great Britain, will the Prime Minister make a full statement of the action proposed by his Government to ensure the maximum flow of goods between Australia and Great Britain?

* I ask the Minister to picture a public **crisis** or a great public issue of a political nature arising, in which the moral interests of the people are deeply involved, [f the provision remains as it is, it could be used by the board to prevent the leader of some church from making a pronouncement on it.

* I understand that all sorts of moves are being made to settle the strike on the railway but I suggest that the Government should take heed of an old proverb to the effect that prevention is better than cure, particularly as, in this instance, the sufferer will be not the Government but the civilian producer - the man who has the least chance of doing anything to help himself in this **crisis**.

* miners must be condemned for refusing to produce sufficient coal to meet the needs of the nation in its present **crisis**.

* Let us see what the Prime Minister has said on this point - 
The **crisis** leaves the Government no escape from the duty it owes to the nation of getting the quantity of coal required.

* It is a national tragedy that at this hour of **crisis** in the greatest war in the history of the British Empire we should be arguing a measure of this kind to the exclusion of matters more directly associated with the war.

* In view of the acute food **crisis** in Great Britain and of the good example set by the people of Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Argentina, who have sent gifts of food to that country, will the Prime Minister see whether a better governmental effort to help the British people is not possible?

* The cost of aluminium sheets is very much greater than that of tinplate and whilst the present hard currency **crisis** continues there is no intention to consider the importation of the more 'expensive material.

* There is a tendency, of course, to say that in the present economic **crisis** in Great Britain to which the honorable member for Fawkner referred, the Americans are not doing all that they might do to help Great Britain.

* In view of the information now coming to hand about England's financial position in relation to dollars, will the Treasurer say whether it will be necessary for the Government to give further consideration to the importation of oil from overseas, particularly in view of the increased fuel consumption that will be caused by the present coal **crisis**?

* a gallon was added to help the country meet that great, economic and financial **crisis**.

* Military intelligence, home security officers, and officials of both Commonwealth and State departments are able to point to what they believe to be  the irreproachable conduct in this **crisis** of great numbers of persons who can be described technically as enemy aliens.

* It has taken another war to teach us that full-time employment can be provided at a time of national **crisis**, when the goods produced are for the destruction of human life and not for improving the lot of mankind in the world.

* In his book,  Caucus Crisis: The Rise and Fall of the Scullin Government,  by Warren Denning - a sympathetic history of the Labour party's history at that period - honorable members will find the following: - 
The honorable member for Henty  (Mr. Gullett)  mentioned the migration of Germans to Australia.

* German migrants have settled in various parts of Australia, and during two world wars it was proved that they could be easily assimilated, and could be relied upon as loyal citizens in time of **crisis**.

* In view, then, of the terrible danger that we are facing - a danger which we can only hope to meet and overcome by putting forth all the energy and power of which wc are capable - is it not remarkable that in such a time of **crisis** we have not been able to bring about that unity of thought and action which is so necessary to the proper conduct of the war?

* The **crisis** was reached in midSeptember, when all the auspices were favorable for a German attack, andwhen shipping and troop concentrations reached their maximum.

* Only recently the secretary of the British Transport Workers Union indicated his agreement with  Mr. Churchill's  view that the British people should stay at- home and fight .out the **crisis** that confronts them.

* It would be difficult to persuade the British Government to allow hundreds of thousands of people to leave the country in one big mass migration movement and particularly at this time when it is in the throes of an economic **crisis**.

* Is it too much to ask that when, in this hour of gravest **crisis**, the flower of this generation's manhood is prepared, if necessary, to immolate itself on the altar of national sacrifice in order to defend Australia, the married women of the nation should not shirk their duty to the country?

* That notice of motion is important for a variety of reasons, the first of which is that our fellow Britishers in the Old Country are facing a **crisis** without parallel in their history.

* I think that he may say that in the supreme **crisis** of our history, the Curtin Government ran true to Australian traditions and tried to get easy money by an immense gamble - by staking the financial stability of the  country on a voluntary effort.

* The Commonwealth Government is showing to the people of Australia and to other countries that, at the time of the nation's greatest **crisis**, one government can direct the affairs of our country.

* The sudden cessation of government spending, before there has been time to set other forms of enterprise in motion, must create an economic **crisis**.

* It would be a wonderful gesture if, in r.his time of **crisis**, members of Parliament agreed to contribute one-tenth of their salaries, or 100 per annum to war funds.

* Does not the honorable gentleman think that in a period of national **crisis** such as the present and in view of the shortage of petrol, the excise should be waived in order to encourage the extraction of oil from our minerals?

* On a previous occasion we faced an economic **crisis**.

* I sincerely hope that he did not present the official view of Labour, because I fear for the future of this country if, by mischance, the Labour Opposition were to occupy the treasury bench in a time of **crisis** and gave effect to the views expounded by him.

* Wc are endeavouring to assist in the **crisis** in New South Wales.

* They have been excessively severe; but they were imposed for the purpose of getting this country out of a previous **crisis**.

* This promise of preference was not loosely made to serve the needs of the moment; it was a solemn pledge, given on behalf of the people of this country in a great **crisis** by a Labour government, who .

* In a time of **crisis**, France took the only  possible course open to it to safeguard  itself.

* If the reason for the initiation of this debate by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies)  was to ask what the Government's role is in this **crisis**, the right honorable gentleman has been answered by speakers from  this  side of the House, who have directed attention to the fact that in 1940, under circumstances that were somewhat similar to the present circumstances, the right honorable gentleman himself took action parallel to that which has been taken by this Government.

* Although some members of the Opposition have attempted to gain political advantage from this **crisis**, the honorable member for Fawkner  (Mr. Holt)  has said that in 1940 the Menzies Government insisted that the coal strike of that year should be settled by arbitration, but he let the cat out of the bag by saying that at that time there was plenty of coal at grass, so the Government did not care what happened.

* It is true that different parts of the Empire are independent nations, but they are just as certain to stand together in a **crisis** as is the.

* During the years of **crisis** the Parliament delegated its authority to the Executive.

* The international **crisis** has passed.

* That in view of the immense accumulation of savings now held by the Savings Bank; of the various States, and of the confidence of the people in the existing institutions, it is not advisable that the Commonwealth Government should enter into competition with the Savings Banks of the States, and such competition and the possible transfer of large sums of money from one set of banks to another is calculated to bring about digtrust and financial **crisis**.

* .- 1 cannot understand why the Government is bringing down a bill of this kind during this time of **crisis**.

* But my purpose is to do what I believe is the duty that I owe, as leader of this party, to Australia and to express what the party believes to be its duty to Australia in what is the greatest period of **crisis** that Australia has ever known, and which, if  we  surmount it successfully, will I hope be  the  end to any recurrence of the possibility of such crises in the future.

* Yet honorable gentlemen apposite have the audacity to criticize this Government for the housing shortage when it is concentrating on meeting the greatest **crisis** that this country has ever encountered.

* I can hardly  recall  a session in Parliament in that period without either a coal debate or a coal **crisis**, yet every treatment prescribed to cure the malady, whether by Sankey Samuel, or Coal Tie-organization Commission, has resulted in failure.

* Has the Acting Minister for Supply and Shipping seen a statement in last week's Queensland press that organizations of graziers in that State expect a transport **crisis** which will adversely affect meat production, because there is little prospect of the rubber control authorities being able to meet the urgent minimum demands of thousands of primary producers for more tyres' and tubes?

* Does the Prime Minister not think that it is of the utmost importance that the Australian Government, and its Minister for External Affairs, should have  -a  consistent policy of support for Great Britain and the United States of America in .the present **crisis** in Europe.?

* What seems, to be needed is a systematic campaign, sustained by example as well as precept, to encourage such a high, sense of individual responsibility that anything in conduct or language which is obscene, indecent or blasphemous, will be outlawed because it undermines the noblest qualities of a real soldier and betrays a weakness of character disastrous to morale in times of **crisis**.

* The need to call to the bar of this House the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for examination regarding the international monetary position, with particular reference to the dollar **crisis**, Australia's international reserves, the price of gold, and international exchange problems generally.

            obtaining during the **crisis** period.

* If, instead of starving the community of credit in this period of **crisis**, they had pursued a policy of sustaining industry until it could adjust itself gradually to the altered economic conditions, Australia could easily have weathered the storm.

* In view of the growing dissatisfaction of the people of Australia with the Government's socialization policy, its present Micawber-like attitude towards the great industrial **crisis**, and its reluctance to deal with communism- 
Questioned at a press conference on his personal inspection of European recovery under the Marshall Plan,  Mr. Hoffman  was pressed to comment on charges that Socialism was responsible for Britain's economic **crisis**.

* Yet, strangely enough, there has not been an Empire conference to consider the present food **crisis**.

* The indication by the Australian PrimeMinister that there is some new grave turn in the dollar **crisis** is mystifying.

* The **crisis** that appears to have arisen in Victoria may result in the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly, and this would prevent the Victorian Minister for Agriculture,  Mr. McKenzie,  from introducing the legislation to which I have  referred.

* I ask the Attorney-General to explain to the House why, in a time of national **crisis*** such as that which faced Australia in 1942, Communists were granted immunity from internment ?

* The honorable member said that he would hae supported this proposal had not other matters been more vital in this time of national **crisis**.

* It can be solved only by a concentrated effort of production in Australia, bv a resolute combing out of all existing resources to see how much can go to Britain, and by a determination that that effort shall continue until the **crisis** in Britain has passed.

* If a political **crisis** should occur during the period of postponement for further consideration it may happen that the measure will never be passed, and, therefore, many people would lose the benefits which the bill provides.

* In a time like the present, when we are confronted by a national **crisis** of great magnitude, we should be prepared to preserve our liberties by giving of those liberties with both hands in order to strengthen our war effort, so that we may bring it to a successful conclusion.

* The dollar **crisis**, I believe, results from the  fact that the United States of America has  not  learned that a country that is an international investor must have an unfavorable trade balance.

* No  agreement at Geneva, no trips ro Havana or anything else will solve the dollar **crisis** except the method that I have mentioned.

* If we do, we shall make it almost impossible to revive the falling birth-rate, and shall perpetuate the idea that this is not a natural event in the life of any family but is merely a major medical **crisis** for the mother.

* We are witnessing the greatest **crisis** in the world's history.

* The Minister for Supply and Shipping said that talk of the war **crisis** would not have any appreciable effect upon the younger men in the coal mines.

* This becomes more deplorable still in view of the present grave international **crisis** and of the possible interruption of our supplies of oil from islands lying between 400 miles and 500 miles north-west of Australia.

* One is by strengthening Australia's economy by increasing its overall sales at reasonably profitable prices, and the other is by substantially increasing British export markets so that the United Kingdom is assisted materially in overcoming the economic **crisis** disclosed in the recently published white paper,, the  Economic Survey for  1947.

* The attitude of the Country party has always been that there should be in the Ministry during this time of **crisis**, not only members of that party, but members of the Labour party, sharing the responsibility of government.

* Does any honorable member suggest that in the great **crisis** of 1929 the people of this country were without milk because the cows ceased to produce milk ; or that they were without fruit because the fruit trees ceased to bear fruit; or that they were without bread because the wheat refused to grow?

* The **crisis** was the inevitable result of dictation by the "mad dog's" of capitalism.

* So far as the security service is concerned, I repeat what the Prime Minister said this afternoon - that it is an efficient organization able to deal with extremist bodies, either of the right or of the left, and able at a moment's notice to do its duty in any future eventuality, as undoubtedly it did its duty during the great **crisis** of" World War II.

* It is well to recall that, although William Pitt was Prime Minister of England at 24 years of age, Winston Churchill, at 69 years, was Prime Minister in the nation's greatest **crisis**.

* A **crisis** over the words " full employment " - words so general and  indefinitive,  so obviously impossible to construe as a mutual contractual obligation by 50 nations -  quite  frankly seemed to me to be a very synthetic **crisis**.

* Honorable members have a responsibility to Australia, and must endeavour in this period of **crisis**, to govern smoothly and efficiently, even though in strength the Government and the Opposition are so even.

* .- The new section proposed by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies)  represents a contribution from two political parties on the gravest **crisis** that has ever confronted this country in peace-time.

* **crisis** may very well bring the country to ruin and civil war unless prompt action be taken.

* They are the calmest people in a time of **crisis**.

* Obviously if we want to encourage a national industry such as this, which has involved a loss of many 'thousands of pounds of the taxpayers money during the recent national **crisis**, then it is up to us to remove the duty altogether.

* What is necessary for the security of the country in a time of acute **crisis** may not be necessary after the **crisis** disappears.

* The only thing new in the coal-mining industry of that State is that during the period of greatest **crisis**, involving the security of the Commonwealth, the miners, "on the Prime Minister's own showing, have lowered the coal production of New South Wales by over 2,000,000 tons in less than nine months.

* Addressing an audience of 2,600 not Jong ago,  Mr. Byrnes  said that America might have to face an international **crisis** within a matter of weeks.

* Current wireless messages from overseas relating to the Berlin **crisis** indicate that Russia is still determined not to be friendly with the Western Powers, and to hinder them in every possible way.

* .- It is unfortunate for Australia that in our **crisis** we should have in the Ministry a man like the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction  (Mr. Dedman),  who understands so little of what trade between countries means.

* First, honorable members who to-day occupy the Opposition benches
              failed to measure up to standard in the conduct of the affairs of this nation in the
              days of peace as well as in the hour of **crisis**.

* Then, in - this national **crisis** which has overtaken us, it again
              demonstrated that it was not to be trusted with the government of the country.

* He returned to work only because he wished to help his country during this time of **crisis**, and it is unfair that he should be treated in this way.

* During the war an Imperial War Cabinet was established; but no thinking man would suggest that such a body could be of use except in a time of dire national **crisis**.

* To assist the people of Great Britain in their desperate economic **crisis**, which, according to figures published in to-day's press, is worsening, I ask the Minister what steps, if any, have been taken to reduce the consumption of meat in excess of the ration scale in this country ?

* The Australian Workers Union informed me, categorically, that the retention of men in the mines was, for them, a question of secondary importance in the present **crisis**; that they supported wholeheartedly the Government's proposal to use the man-power in the mines in the way which would most effectively secure the successful prosecution of the war.

* The Minister, after several attempts by us to interest the Government in the matter, made a statement, but, after having read it three times in an endeavour to extract , from it hope of action, I find that it is only a recital of reasons why we cannot do anything rather- than a statement of what the Government intends to do to help* the people of Britain through the **crisis***.

* I have commented before on the precipitate termination of lend-lease transactions, and I will: not go over the ground again ; but, whatever may be the legal position as between the United States of America and the countries that were in receipt of lendlease aid, there is no question as to the ties of kinship between us and the people of Great Britain, who are facing a food **crisis** equal to any that developed duringthe war.

* In the last issue of the Sydney  Truth  appeared a news item from its London correspondent, stating that there was no longer any **crisis** in Great Britain.

* The **crisis** had passed ; but the condition of the people was one almost of coma, because of the severity of the winter and the shortage of coal, gas and electricity.

* The speech delivered to-day by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Curtin)  was typical of most of his remarks on war issues since the present **crisis** has developed.

* He argued that an alert and critical Opposition would be much more valuable to the nation in this time of **crisis** than co-operation by all parties in the House for the purpose of forming a national administration.

* In the first place, the people of Australia have almost unanimously accepted the system of compulsory military training during the present **crisis**, and even the Labour party, until the Leader of the Opposition spoke to-day, has not ventured to suggest any alteration of that system.

* That kind of criticism panders to a section of opinion in the country which is always ready to look for a scapegoat, but we know that there is no justification for turning and rending one man at this moment of **crisis**, merely because he does not measure up to the standard.

* In the present **crisis**, they simply do not exist, and the Leader of the Opposition is well aware of it.

* A **crisis** has been reached, with industry paralysed.

* It is a remarkable fact that free enterprise, which is anathema to socialists, is showing a socialist government a way out of the present petrol **crisis**.

* Is it a fact that Commonwealth and State authorities have warned that industry, transport, gas and electricity undertakings will suffer a major **crisis** in two weeks unless coal production is increased?

* the national interest what immediate steps he proposes to take to avert the threatened major, **crisis**?

* The **crisis** in home-building has existed for a long time, and honorable members on this side of the chamber have great difficulty in galvanizing the Government into action.

* We were reminded this afternoon that the sales tax was introduced as an expedient in a time of **crisis**, on the understanding that when the **crisis** passed it would be removed.

* Eyes more searching, more watchful and more unforgetting than Hitler's are upon the Government of Australia in this **crisis**.

* I believe that it is his desire to build out of the country's present trials a great reputation, a monument more enduring than bronze, in order that future generations of Australians will honour his name as that of a great man who, in a time of **crisis**, did generous and magnanimous deeds the memory of which will live in this country for ever.

* I have no doubt that all these propositions are elementary; but unless the governments and peoples who desire peace concentrate their minds upon the true elements which underlie any permanent solution, the world may yet pass from **crisis** to **crisis**, and, indeed, from disaster to disaster.

* That is the position now despite the fact that the world to-day faces the same trouble as it faced during the Munich **crisis** of 1938.

* But that scheme will be further delayed because of our inability during the present dollar **crisis** to obtain machinery from the United States of America.

* He talks of the dollar **crisis**.

* No self-respecting commanding officer who has an obligation to maintain discipline and, at the same time, to bring his unit to a state of fitness to meetany contingency or **crisis** that may arise, would tolerate political interference with his command.

* To my surprise, when I went out into the electorate expecting a certain amount of carping criticism on the lines suggested by the honorable member, I found absolute unanimity amongst the people that Parliament should not dream of inflicting general elections upon them at this time of **crisis**, when they are in a state of great mental stress and certainly have no goodwill towards Parliament.

* Their only question is what we are doing to play our part in this **crisis**.

* We are faced with  the  **crisis** of our time, and the Government acknowledges  that  by using the words "national emergency" in its bill.

* Tha.t is the right and proper mental attitude for all critics, either of the Australian Parliament or the Australian Government, in this hour of **crisis**.

* Even though we are passing through the most dreadful **crisis** of our history, let us not scrap our birthright in attempting to preserve it.

* In the greatest **crisis** of our history the Government proposes to conscript 22,400,000 of new money for the war effort, leaving 13S,000,000 to be raised in response to voluntary appeals.

* He faced the last great **crisis**, fortified by the philosophy which had seen him through so many personal and political crises, both before and after he became Prime Minister.

* I know what he has done for Queensland in the past, and I am grateful for what he is doing for that State to-day at this time of **crisis**.

* If we were given that information, we should be in a position to say whether the Government, in its general policy, and the administration on its part were doing all that could be reasonably expected in this **crisis** with the facilities at their disposal.

* If the international situation were so grave as the Government stated, the House should not go into recess, but should remain in session until the **crisis** eases.

* I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the threat of a coal **crisis** on the northern fields where miners will hold stop-work meetings on Thursday to consider a general strike on issues involved in the Elrington colliery dispute.

* Having regard to the restricted coal output since the general coal strike and the threat of a **crisis** in the north, will the Government invite the Australian "Workers Union to take whatever steps are necessary to enable it to work open-cut mines and break the stranglehold which the miners' federation has on the coalmining industry?

* We have a duty to the people whom we represent, to take action in a **crisis** in the light of existing conditions so as to preserve the interests of the people.

* I say this deliberately: The Government is not prepared to face the **crisis** which it anticipates, and it wants to pass responsibility onto the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and his officers.

* The task of the Treasurer  (Mr. Chifley)  in this time of **crisis** is not easy.

* If the honorable gentleman is in a mood to offer opinions, I ask him to say why another and a. better system of income tax should not be adopted, a system of imposing such tax as would ensure that no one in the community should have more than 400 per annum in this time of **crisis**.

* I also see no reason why we ought to continue in the present **crisis** a system of income tax which sufficed in peace-time, particularly as the people on lower incomes are now burdened with rising costs of living and a scarcity of commodities.

* In the near future, this Government will find itself confronted with a **crisis** which  it will Iia ve cause to remember and to regret.

* It was this quality that sustained him in the greatest political **crisis** of those fateful years.

* greatest **crisis** which this country has ever faced.

* We want men who will have some years of active government service in front of them, if need be ; at any rate, men who can spare a few years to help in the administration of the war effort at this time of **crisis**.

* He referred to the **crisis** through which the sterling areas are at present passing as the result of the lack of balance between the dollar and sterling, to the effect of that **crisis** on the United Kingdom and ako on Australia, and to the attempts that have been made by the United States of America, through loans and Marshall aid, to assist in the solution of the problems that have arisen.

* They say that the nationalization of banking is contrary to the spirit of democracy and beyond the powers of the Parliament; but we say that their selfish actions in the past during times, of financial **crisis** were contrary to democracy.

* The United States of America is experiencing such a **crisis** now.

* Now, the right honorable gentleman did not make any reference whatever to the history of the banking **crisis** of 1S93.

* The Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems, of which the honorable member for New England  (Mr. Abbott)  was a member, referred to the bank **crisis** of 1893 in paragraph 216 of its report in the following terms : - 
 In a time of **crisis** members of this Parliament should set an example to the nation.

* In this time of **crisis** all speeches made in this House should be made with a sense of responsibility and a regard for the interests of the nation.

* I do not care whether it is illegal or legal; if Communists are doing a. disservice to Australia in this time of **crisis**, they should be put under lock and key.

* A returned soldier friend of mine, who is a commercial traveller, and- covers a wide area of country, is astounded at the sympathy with Germany and Russia that is being expressed at this time of **crisis**.

* Government to take steps to put under , look and key those elements that are likely to cause trouble in time of **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister has lectured us on several occasions about the sterlingdollar **crisis**.

* Experience has shown that in times of **crisis** some industries can be established on a firm footing, which, in normal times, would not have been possible.

* As the result of the world **crisis** and the .difficulty of obtaining supplies from abroad, they are making new arrangements with financial institutions, putting their savings into clearing and fencing additional areas, and adopting improved methods of culture in order substantially to increase production.

* -I direct the attention of the Minister for Information to an article which appeared in to-day's issue of the  Sydney Morning Herald  entitled " Coal Crisis - The Call for Popular Action ".

* In dealing with these imaginary troubles he paints the Australian working man, at least by implication when he talks of the penalties that are to be inflicted in the future in respect of industrial strife, as a saboteur and unpatriotic individual at a time when Australia is facing the greatest **crisis** in its history.

* He was very greatly respected, both in this Parliament and in his electorate, and the esteem in which he was held makes the task even harder for one who enters this House as his successor at the moment of our greatest national **crisis**.

* Whatever the views of honorable members may be, they must realize what a disaster a financial **crisis** would be in the midst of a desperate war.

* Having regard to the difficult times through which we are passing in the greatest **crisis** in the nation's history, any unprejudiced person who has studied the Fadden budget will agree that it waa a statesmanlike effort.

* From the military standpoint, Australia has surmounted the **crisis**.

* Although the immediate **crisis** has now passed, there is no room for complacency, and we must not relax our efforts.

* 1 do not object to an all-night sitting when such a course is rendered necessary by an unexpected **crisis**.

* If Australia again faces a **crisis**, the Commonwealth will not have to go cap in hand to private enterprise and ask for properties in order that the administration of the country may be carried on in a proper manner.

* If we are again faced with a **crisis**, the Commonwealth will have its own administrative offices and will be able to put our defence machinery into operation overnight.

* What ave the reserves for, except for a **crisis**?

* And how much more of a **crisis** are they reserving their undistributed profits for ? "

* All honorable members are anxious to hear the information which the Government proposes to impart; but I cannot understand why the Parliament was not assembled and all the information placed before it on which the Acting Prime Minister based his statement that a state of **crisis** existed.

* We are well aware of the difficult **crisis** through which the people of the United Kingdom are now passing.

* They should fight to prevent a recurrence of an economic **crisis**.

* I do not think that anything is to be gained by attempting to precipitate a **crisis** in this matter.

* Therefore, we are as one with the people of the United Kingdom in the dollar **crisis** that is upon us.

* The Central Executive said in the present circumstances, which more or less have reached the status of a. **crisis** insofar as administration of the industrial machinery and the Central Reference Board is concerned.

* It is anomalous that, in times of great national **crisis**, nothing will stop the States from handing over to the Commonwealth such sovereign powers as they possess which the Commonwealth may exercise for the security of the nation, and that, when the **crisis** passes, the States demand the return of those powers.

* Earlier the American Government had been incapable of combatting the long series of difficulties which developed, culminating in the world economic **crisis**.

* The policy of buying off might have been, in the circumstances of the **crisis**, the best one open to the government of, the day.

* In a situation of international **crisis** it is imperative that malignant lying should not add to troubles that may genuinely exist.

* Is it a fact, as reported in Melbourne to-day, that consideration is being given to the making of an application for the deregistration of the Amalgamated Engineering Union for its action in precipitating an industrial **crisis** in Victoria?

* If this course is not contemplated, what action is the Commonwealth Government taking to terminate the **crisis** in Victoria precipitated by the extension of the engineers' strike?

* Australia, in common with most nations, was in the midst of an economic **crisis** at that time.

* The Government does not propose to exercise the powers which it is seeking, but it desires that those powers be incorporated in the Constitution as a reserve, so that if a **crisis** arises the government of the day, irrespective of its political colour, will be able to act effectively.

* One of the most disappointing features which 
He said it before the Berlin **crisis**.

* My statement was also made before the **crisis** developed.

* A black market can exist only in a community passing through a great **crisis**.

* That **crisis** might be the throes of a depression, as in 1930.

* It will be remembered that at that time of sartorial **crisis** the male population of Australia was mainly distinguished by a vast love of vests and, inch by inch, the Government retreated before a solid phalanx of waistcoat buttons.

* I should be happy to see as many shipyards established as could possibly be provided, because the plants could be utilized for defence purposes in a national **crisis**.

* I have always been strongly of the opinion that if the British Empire had stood firm and retained the sterling  bloc,  as it could have done after the victories over Japan and Germany, America, in its own interests as well as in the interests of the world generally, would have had to give money to Britain instead of lending it, and Britain would have passed more quickly through its **crisis**.

* If Australia ratifies this charter and is afterwards overtaken by an economic **crisis**, we shall not be able to act so quickly as conditions may demand, but will have to wait until we have observed the procedure prescribed in the charter.

* However, we shall not be able to make a prompt adjustment of the tariff in order to meet the **crisis**.

* The Treasurer and his officers have made statements which have been published in to-day's issue of the  Sydney Morning Herald,  indicating that the dollar **crisis** may last for three years.

* I am attempting to show the Government how it could play its part in an attempt to prevent the dollar **crisis** lasting for more than a couple of years.

* I admit that that department is rendering good service ; but, surely, in a time of **crisis**, when we are obliged to expend more lavishly in order to ensure our very existence, we should not expend our money unnecessarily.

* In the present **crisis** no honorable member should occupy his time in that way.

* The Parliament should remain in session until the **crisis** in the coal-mining industry passes.

* Even although the present **crisis** may last for only a few weeks, it will take a much longer period to recover our former position.

* There are many sound reasons why the Commonwealth Government should control our entire rail system in war-time, but whatever action we may take in that regard, it is indisputable that a **crisis** such as this cannot he met satisfactorily unless control of all forms of transport, air, land and sea, is in the hands of the Commonwealth, lt should be the function of one central authority to determine priorities for the carriage of goods and passengers, both interstate and intra-state.

* The amazing part is that, although the situation was said to be deteriorating suddenly after the 8th August, immediately after Cabinet had decided that the Prime Minister should go to England, not a word was heard of the special **crisis** over Thailand and the imminence of war.

* The result sought to be obtained was obtained by the Cabinet decision of the 12th August, when the **crisis** abruptly ceased and normal activities were apparently restored.

* No more was heard about the **crisis** over Thailand, and the imminence of war, until the Minister for Commerce  (Sir Earle Page)  repeated last Monday the statement that Australia was in imminent danger of invasion.

* The right honorable gentleman added that if this particular proposal - that the Prime Minister should go abroad - were defeated, or not accepted, the only result would be a political **crisis**, followed  by an  election - which would be " treasonable ".

* We should be devoting our time to other  and more vital matters,- and in particular to the serious international **crisis** which faces us.

* Sir Stafford  Cripps, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, has so far been successful in imposing his will upon the trade union movement in Great Britain and in persuading trade unionists that they ought to call a holiday on wage increases until this **crisis** has been surmounted, but one of the troubles is that most of the unionists do not believe that there is a **crisis**.

* It is not very easy for a man to believe that there is a **crisis** in the world if his wages are coming in regularly.

* I do not pretend to understand the intricacies of international exchange, but I recall that in the not far distant past Australia was in the throes of an economic **crisis**.

* It was a **crisis** such as had never been faced by this country in the memory of living men.

* I well remember that during that **crisis**, against the desire of the government of the day and against the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, which is the controller of these matters in this country, the Australian exchange rate was depreciated very substantially.

* I think that the incident occurred at the end of 1939, and in the middle of 1940, the greatest **crisis** of this war took place.

* No **crisis** that we in Australia faced early in 1942 can be compared to the **crisis** that humanity faced in the middle of 1940.

* At that time of extreme **crisis** early in 1942, the military authorities certainly had just grounds for suspecting this organization of being ready to act the part of quislings in the event of Japanese success in North Australia.

* In these times of **crisis**, surely all parties can work together in a government in order to solve the problems with which we are confronted.

* Whenever a **crisis** arises, shipping services to Tasmania are the first to suffer.

* Will the Government be prepared to discuss this matter with the manufacturers of approved units, in order that those who in the past have tried to solve the transport problem may not incur losses through their desire to assist the Government in this time of **crisis**?

* I am left completely cold by the talk of the great service which the newspapers have done for the Government and the country during the present national **crisis**.

* I point out to the honorable gentleman, in the first place, that the **crisis** through which Australia has passed was nothing like as tense or as critical as the **crisis** through which the United Kingdom has passed.

* These schemes have been devised during a time of internal stress and **crisis**, for there can be no denial of the fact that, the Curtin Labour Government has used its majority, in a time of war,' to place on the statute-book, and even to.

* They may not be completely applicable to each particular **crisis**.

* No matter how grateful the people may be to  Mr. Churchill  - and we all owe a debt of gratitude to him for leading us through the present **crisis** - there should be practical recognition of the sacrifices of the workers and the members of the fighting services.

* According to a cablegram from London published in the press to-day - 
Government they could have rendered great service to the nation in the present **crisis**.

* The Government should have power to deal expeditiously with any **crisis** that may arise.

* The Pacific **crisis** developed on the 17th July, when Prince Konoye formed a stronger government to carry out on stronger lines Matsuoka's  southward policy.

* Japan, it is true, has laid in stocks, but there is a very real danger that the oil position may come to a **crisis**.

* In Canberra sometimes we seem to be in an unreal world; petty subjects are discussed, and there is bickering and controversy quite inconsistent with the gravity of the **crisis**, which is the most serious in the history of the world.

* We are facing the most serious **crisis** in the history of Australia and of the British Empire.

* The struggle will be won by the workers in the munitions factories and in the fighting services, whom the great Labour movement in the past advised to prepare for this **crisis**.

* For the last four or five days the press and the air have been filled with references to a political **crisis**, and the possibility of an early election.

* This morning, every honorable member received a copy of those opinions, though, apparently, in the final analysis, they had no more effect on the resolution of the **crisis** than on those honorable members who read them- or on those who did not.

* That period was chosen because it is usually taken to mark the interval between the onset of the **crisis** and the trough of the depression.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies)  has been giving free advice about what ought to b e done in this **crisis**.

* We all are concerned about the inconvenience and hardship to which the community is being exposed by the action of the coal-miners, but I recall 1940, when the Leader of the Opposition had to face a **crisis** in the coal industry.

* They believe that the party which is capable of administering Australia in the **crisis** of war is also capable of administering it in the **crisis** that peace will bring.

* At any rate, had the rest of Australia voted as did the soldiers and the people of Western Australia and 
Moreover, the Commonwealth Bank Board, as constituted by the Bruce-Page Government, alined itself with the private banks during the **crisis** of the early thirties in attempting to force upon the Government a policy of monetary deflation and curtailment of wages and social service payments.

* The truth was that he, as the leader of the Government in that **crisis**, saw the extreme significance of the closest co-operation between the United States and Australia in thePacific.

* That statement expresses the views of the Australian Government and of the Government of New South Wales concerning the **crisis** which has arisen in the coal industry.

* But there ?s not one penny for the pain and loss of social prestige that he suffered, which will be remembered for all' time, despite the public vindication of his honour, as the result of his having for a long  period in the time of Australia's greatest **crisis** been interned as a subversive subject.

* This legislation is unworthy of the Government in the present **crisis**.

* The whole basis of the budget is that we live in times of grave emergency: We are facing the **crisis** of a war.

* We, in this House, have heard Ministers, at their places at the table, speaking for the last few years about Communist activities, and almost every time what has been said, in the very **crisis** of the particular issue, has been something designed, not to reprimand these people, not to put them back, not to defeat them, but to encourage them.

* In that article he says that the coal strike  wa9  deliberately promoted in order to weaken the Australian economy at a time of **crisis** and to prevent preparation for war.

* He clearly indicated how the private banks had failed to withstand the stress imposed on them in critical periods, such as the economic **crisis** of the nineties, the 1914-18 war, the depression of 1929 to 1932, and, lastly, the present war.

* Whenever there is an economic **crisis**, they curtail the circulation of money and bring about deflation, with the result that there is economic stagnation, unemployment, poverty, and starvation, followed by death for many unfortunate people.

* Great Britain has discarded the theory which it held a few years ago, that the most effective way in which to overcome a **crisis** is to reduce the standard of living to conditions of semi-poverty.

* If 50 per cent, of the Government's majority is able to change its opinion so readily, surely the Government can admit the need to change its policy in the face of a national **crisis**.

* I shall help the Commonwealth Government to the best of my ability to put the States in their place, make them curtail their spending, and bow to the will of the National Parliament and the Rational Government in this hour of **crisis**.

* Honorable members will readily see that this probably is one of the greatest times  of **crisis** in his life.

* Yet, having reached what may be described as the end of the road in the **crisis** through which we are passing, the Government, needing to raise 186,000,000 for defence expenditure, further burdens those who have never really had their heads above water in the last ten or twelve years.

* Be that as it may, the **crisis** through which we are passing calls, I think, for courageous men.

* The Minister should seek to set a standard from the example given by those in the heart of the Empire instead of trying to defend those who have refused to do their duty in Australia during a time of national **crisis**.

* This war has taught us that, in a **crisis**, we cannot stand alone against an aggressor.

* Whether or not, during the present grave **crisis**, this Parliament, is to be made workable, depends entirely upon the resolution of members themselves, and, particularly, upon members of this House.

* Certainly the House of Commons once resolved in a great constitutional **crisis** that it was wrong and highly unconstitutional that in relation to the vote of members of an assembly such as this, the threat of dissolution should be used against the members of the House of Commons.

* The dollar **crisis** has provided us with a sharp reminder of three important truths.

* The first is that the dollar **crisis** has affected Australia very much more severely than it has affected the United States of America or Canada.

* One of the first facts that one notices about the dollar **crisis** is that it completely debunks the glittering story of the Chifley system of brummagem finance.

* That fallacy has been the basis of Labour's financial policy and of most of its actions, and now, in the hour of **crisis**, it is proved to be a broken reed.

* It was caused by an international **crisis** and the consequent decrease of the prices paid for our major exports.

* It seems to me to be a  very  proper authority which any government should have at its disposal during a period  of  **crisis**.

* In his book  The World Crisis  Mr. Churchill  deals with the position that prevailed in Great Britain after the 1914-18 world war, when the system of demobilization adopted was based primarily on occupational con siderations and the needs of civil industry in England.

* Mr. Churchill  says - 
To this general confusion of thought, and interplay of self-interests, the banks contributed in the early stage of the **crisis**.

* There was much evidence of this innate conservatism in their actions during the **crisis**, and in their general unwillingness to break new ground.

* In the **crisis**  over  the claims of Argentina and Chile  foi  sovereignty over British territory in the South Atlantic, the Australian Government offered naval co-operation to Great Britain, which was gratefully acknowledged.

* Honorable members witnessed examples of this in the **crisis** over Argentina, in the Anzac Pact between Australia and New Zealand and in Australia's initiative in seeking co-ordination of foreign policy with respect to thcJapanese Peace Treaty, at the conference in Canberra last August to which I have already alluded.

* In every **crisis**, we start to murder the language by conjuring up new phrases or concocting words which seem to express the views or emotions of the moment.

* They crashed in the **crisis** of 1.893, and only recently  were  some people compensated for their losses at that time.

* In a time of impending international financial **crisis**, no nation can afford not to be master of its own financial destinies.

* During the depression, when Australia experienced its greatest financial **crisis**, the private trading banks failed this country.

* Over the years, they have had very fair treatment from successive governments, and at a time when the country was faced with a financial **crisis**, they abused their privileges.

* If an election had .been precipitated as the result of the recent budget **crisis**, a grave responsibility would have rested upon those who advised His Excellency the Governor-General to dissolve this House.

* The value of such a suggestion could, with advantage, be examined in any future **crisis**.

* On those occasions, I said that Parliament should meet regularly, and that especially it should meet in times of **crisis**.

* The effort that was made in the year of real **crisis**, when Japan seemed likely to invade this country, has not been recaptured.

* If the Government permitted the House to discussthe motion standingin my name those honorable members who areso upset just now would be brought face to face with what would be for them a personal **crisis**.

* The nation does not expect the Parliament to fold up at a time of mounting international **crisis**.

* In view of the discontent which prevails throughout Australia with regard to the proposed system of uniform income taxation, and in view of the need for greater co-ordination of the war effort, will the Prime Minister arrange for a referendum in order to ascertain whether the people will consent to cut away those fungus-like growths, the State Parliaments, so that the Commonwealth will be in a better position to govern the country at this time of its greatest **crisis** ?

* Personally, I welcome the offer of the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope that a method will be found by which unity can be achieved in this **crisis**.

* A fellow grazier who drew his 15,000-acre block the same day as I drew mine has gone through the same vicissitudes as myself and has been harassed by his bankers and forced to put his place on the market for a quarter of its value, but, in the absence of finance and want of confidence, and owing to the financial **crisis**, there are no buyers.

* Stroh was one of many people who were taken into custody in the Malay States during the **crisis** of twelve months ago, and transferred to Australia.

* Nothing is held against Stroh except that he was one' of those who were picked up in the **crisis** of twelve months ago.

* There was no agreement in the strict sense, hut the kinship and close relationship between the countries of the British Commonwealth caused the Dominions to join with the Mother Country in time of **crisis**.

* However, such differences must be reconciled with  the principle of unity in essentials, and the fact remains that countries of the British Commonwealth do unite in times of **crisis**.

* We all know that five years or so ago this country was faced with the gravest **crisis** in its young history.

* I have here extracts from newspaper articles which show that despite what has been suggested by the members of the Government, there was no actual **crisis** in this country.

* The  Financial News  of London stated - 
It should be obvious to everybody that this so-called **crisis** was only a political set-up designed to extricate the Prime Minister and his colleagues from difficulties of their own making.

* In this **crisis**, the Government should control the financial institutions.

* If the money can be found for peaceful development, surely it should be available in a time of national **crisis** !

* I am grateful for the personal effort which he has devoted to the task of organizing and directing this country in its hour of **crisis**.

* Their purpose should be the prevention of movements of large bodies of capital at a time when the country was in the throes of an economic **crisis**.

* In banking circles, " capital movements " refers to abnormal transfers of capital from one country to another because of some economic dislocation or **crisis** which may have arisen.

* It will be remembered that, when we were facing the greatest **crisis** of our history, all sections of the gold-fields community unhesitatingly offered their full and unstinted co-operation, and over 11,000 men were drafted from the mining industry into the various forces and defence undertakings.

* In the **crisis** that confronts Australia, it is an obligation on all of us to take our share of the responsibility for the conduct of the country's affairs.

* This senseless wrangling over things that do not matter very much at this time of **crisis** must disgust every right-thinking person in Australia.

* A striking proof that an impartial account of what occurred in Germany may be of use is to be seen in the fact that, although the German **crisis** is only three years old, similar errors of currency policy are being committed in other countries.

* The supporters of that government will describe the money as a " just contribution by the workers of Australia at a time of great national **crisis** ".

* The right honorable member for Kooyong  (Mr. 
.-I refer to an industrial **crisis** of the first magnitude which has developed in Victoria and which, obviously, is likely to extend to every State of the Commonwealth.

* This is a **crisis** in time of peace.

* Another important advantage will be that in time of war or national **crisis**, all communications will be under one control.

* It is quite patent that the cable and wireless services should be almost a United Kingdom undertaking, and that telecommunications, because of our need to establish quick contact with other, parts of the Dominions in a time of **crisis**, should be controlled by the Government, in order to meet the need for frequent consultation with other members of the British Commonwealth on matters of defence as well as commercial activities, trade agreements, and all matters closely associated with the welfare of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

* Indeed, no form of words can possibly be used that will restore in full the reputation of men about whom it will be said that in the greatest war, the greatest **crisis** of our history, " He was for six months, or whatever it may have been, interned as an enemy of this country ".

* The Prime Minister  (Mr. Chifley)  has said that he has assured the British Prime Minister that Australia will do its utmost to assist Britain in its present **crisis**.

* In this period of **crisis** we require intense organization, coordination and correlation, instead of six different State systems.

* To help the nation in a time of **crisis** should be regarded as an honour.

* People would feel much happier, in bearing the burden of taxation, if the difference were less between soldiers' .pay and the remuneration which other people by the cost-plus system are able to obtain, whether they earn it or not, in this period of **crisis**.

* I approved of the legislation, as did every honorable member, when it was introduced, but, when an economic **crisis** is upon us, amelioration is called for.

* The Government should give effect to the provision which states that - 
We have been caught by the **crisis**, by a development of the **crisis** plainly foreshadowed two years ago, and we have been caught constitutionally un,prepared.

* The very fact that the Government had decided to freeze the funds of the miners' federation indicated that we were doing as much as any government could do to meet the **crisis**.

* We can, in a **crisis**, freeze the funds of a trade union, but it is useless to ban strikes and lock-outs.

* Great attention is focused on coaTminers in times of national, **crisis**-, when they are forced to take action toremedy their grievances.

* Those were the days, also, when a former anti-Labour Prime Minister, the late  Mr. Lyons,  was afraid to call the Parliament together because he was not sure how his own supporters would react to a particular international **crisis** that had arisen.

* I remind honorable members that when Czechoslovakia was seized by Germany in 1939 this Parliament was not in session, and as I have said, the then anti-Labour Prime Minister was not game to call it together because he did not know what action his own followers would take about that **crisis**.

* Another part of the motion states that the Government - 
Every member of this chamber recognizes that the bill has for its objective important changes of our electoral system; but important though they may be, they should not be undertaken at the present time, although I confess I should be obliged to oppose the measure, even if the country were not passing through a great **crisis**.

* I do not wish to impute motives, but when the Government persists in pressing on with this measure in spite of what has been described by responsible observers as the greatest **crisis** in the history of Australia, and in view of the weighty opinions against such action, I am led to believe that it is merely seeking to gain a political advantage.

* I thought that the question before the House was whether the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank should be called to the bar of the House to explain certain matters enumerated in the motion moved hy the honorable member for Reid  (Mr. Lang),  including an examination regarding the international monetary position with particular reference to the dollar **crisis**, Australia's international reserves, the price of gold and international exchange problems generally.

* I do not suggest that American investments in Canada Lave not helped its development, but they mean that, in this dollar **crisis**, Canada has to pay out large sums of money to the United States of America in dividends.

* The recorded facts of history show that those reforms of 1924 enabled the immediate **crisis** to be handled, ensured expansion of the Commonwealth Bank itself, and strengthened the whole banking structure into a symmetrical, and well-balanced system of central banking, without interfering with existing functions of the Commonwealth Bank.

* We went through a **crisis** in 1942, and to a certain degree in 1943, but no reasonable man could say that last year this country was faced with any likelihood of invasion, let alone any likelihood of imminent invasion.

* In regard to agriculture let me tell the "War Cabinet that we are facing a food **crisis**, the like of which no Australian Government has ever faced since the days of Macquarie in New .South "Wales.

* Men who saw active service on the other side of the world during the last war, cannot but be saddened by the knowledge that another **crisis** has come upon the world.

* Is it too' much to ask of the Prime Minister of this democracy, in a time of national **crisis** when the whole transportation system of the nation is in difficulty, and when enormous problems must be faced, to use the power he has to settle the strike?

* Despite the fact that the policy of the present Government is opposed to State enterprise, the nation demands that in this **crisis** ship construction should be undertaken.

* As wool represents about 4'0 per cent, of the valueof Australian exports, it will be seen thai"  a fall in the price of wool may precipitate a financial **crisis** in Australia.

* Those of us who during recent weeks have been studying the history of banking know that nearly every financial **crisis** in this country has been related to the price of wool.

* We are approaching a **crisis**, and no petty standing order should prevent me from placing the matter before Parliament.

* If the Government were able to get out of a **crisis** over the army issue as easily as it got out of the last **crisis** it would have little to worry about.

* In my opinion, there should be even more soldier land settlement after this war than there was after the last, 
!- To-day Australia, as an integral part of the British Empire, faces a grave **crisis**.

* In a **crisis** such as this, we should not stand on ceremony and should consider at once what action should be taken.

* In the period 1933 and 1934 we noticed an emergence from the **crisis** with a stabilization of prices.

* The figures that I am about, to cite prove that in time of **crisis** government institutions, bound by their inflexible rules, tend to be ruthless, whereas private banks, whose policy is bound up more intimately with the welfare of their customers, co-operate more generously.

* I shall show how disastrous this policy can prove, and what losses can be sustained when a **crisis** comes.

* Is the Government aware that coal stocks at Bunnerong power house are again at an alarmingly low level and that any hold-up in deliveries of coal could lead to a major industrial **crisis** in Sydney?

* I do not pretend to be able to analyze the mind of the Communist party ; but its basic philosophy undoubtedly still is that, in a period, of **crisis**, a time of turmoil, or a condition of strife, a revolutionary situation will arise of which- it will take full advantage.

* Proof of that is to be found in the attempt by honorable gentlemen opposite to stifle .the Communist party during a period of **crisis** and its growth during that period.

* This Government  relied  upon the work which it had done, and claimed to have set up the banking machinery necessary should a **crisis** arise.

* I  have always thought that in a time of **crisis** we would be depending upon a measure which, if pushed to the final test, would prove to have no substance.

* 'But -if, in a time of **crisis** &lt;or near **crisis**, the -United Nations decided on a certain lane of policy, is it .

* I believe that the historian will say that the great **crisis** in this war came when the maximum forces of the enemy were being deployed against the minimum forces available to mankind.

* Yet I recall very clearly that during that very period before the middle of 1941, my colleagues and I, some of whom are still here, incurred the bitterest criticism because at that particular time of **crisis** we not only maintained but also built up the strength of the Australian Imperial 
I mention all that because if there is one thing that people- ought to understand and one thing that the Prime Minister would want the people of Australia to understand, it is that the invasion of Europe from the west, so far from being almost a formality which will prelude the defeat of Germany, will in fact be the greatest and most hazardous stroke in the history of war.

* We are approaching a great **crisis** in which only supreme power, backed by supreme courage and delivered with supreme vigour, will bring us victory.

* Because the invasion of Europe, this great coming **crisis** in the war, will be not only an invasion of a powerfully defended country, but an invasion still more of our whole civil life and means of living.

* If Australia is to be a force in world affairs when the war is over, and also is to become selfsufficient so that it may deal with a **crisis** similar to that through which it has gone during the last few years, it will have to develop its light metals to a greater1 degree than they have been developed in the past.

* In the press every day wo read scare headlines, such as "Red terror rules in Berlin", "United States report on kidnapping of Russian officer ", " German **crisis** ; alarming reactions to London plan ".

* There is likely to be a **crisis** in France.

* I am not so much concerned with what is happening at a time when Commonwealth revenue is buoyant as with the **crisis** that is bound to arise when State expenditure reaches the point at which the Commonwealth cannot provide the necessary money without increasing taxes.

* That **crisis** will occur if something is not done to avoid it.

* One of the most important factors was undoubtedly the incompetent direction and management of the smaller financial institutions whose weakness brought about the **crisis**.

* When Australia was passing through the greatest **crisis** in its history; when it was threatened by invasion by the Japanese who had penetrated as far as to the islands to our immediate north, did the banks do anything to stop them?

* I take the following' extract from a bulletin of the United Nations : - 
I ask the Minister for Information whether it is true that the gentleman who has engineered the **crisis** in the undemocratic chamber in the Victorian Parliament is  Sir Prank  Clarke, the vice-chairman of the National Hank of Australia Limited ?

* I do not say that we should have such a reserve, f think that the proper thing was done with our gold; but formerly that reserve was always here for shipment overseas if required, and had always to be taken into account as a reserve in the event of a **crisis**.

* As honorable members will notice, the gold reserve is about 2-J per cent, of the other reserves, but I have no doubt that the other reserves could be availed of in a **crisis**.

* Notwithstanding that the Government has had warning of the position by that fall during the last two years, no action was taken until the **crisis** arose.

* Since the **crisis** began, import restrictions have been imposed on non-sterling countries; but they are totally inadequate.

* I believe that the money will be raised by the determination of the people of this country in this **crisis**.

* I submit that we cannot claim that we are putting forward our maximum effort in this time of **crisis** while we have one person in our community unemployed, who is able to work.

* In a time of national **crisis**, they should be asked to nominate the house in which they wish to live, and the others should be made available to persons who have been searching unsuccessfully for accommodation.

* Let  u9  consider for a moment the financial **crisis** of 1893, and the subsequent establishment, in 1911, of the Commonwealth Bank.

* During the **crisis**, banks, having 905 branches, throughout Australia, with aggregate liabilities of over 100,000,000 suspended operations.

* In 1940, the government, as an act of deliberate policy, allowed the miners to remain on strike if they refused to go back to work under the conditions laid down by the Arbitration Court, knowing that stocks of coal were available to see the community through the **crisis**.

* The Government's attitude on the constructive proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies)  for the holding of secret ballots as a means of averting a **crisis** such as this is also most unsatisfactory.

* Because political life had reached a low level, it infected the body politic of France, and the country collapsed in a national **crisis**.

* A senior Minister has declared that he had been most reliably informed- 
Laws are not passed in a **crisis**, as panic legislation.

* Their reluctance, or determination not to do so, has contributed in  a.  measure to the present petrol **crisis**.

* In a time of acute **crisis**, he has made it possible for the Chinese Republic and its Generalissimo to understand and sympathize with the special difficulties which this Commonwealth  has encountered by its many tasks in different theatres of war.

* We thought it better to continue  Sir Earle  Page's representation on the present footing, believing that, as the war **crisis** deepened, no suggestion or expedient would be rejected merely because it was novel.

* These men are always ready to answer the 'call in time of national **crisis**, be it bush-fire, flood or any other danger that threatens the community.

* As it is, his act of mercy in a national **crisis** has brought him and his family nothing but misery.

* Therefore, the production **crisis** in Australia to-day is not a production **crisis** of any major commodities which are manufactured here.

* Tie Government proposes to continue this co-operation in the fullest degree and in order to assist the United Kingdom in its present dollar **crisis** has decided on drastic measures to reduce imports involving dollar expenditure.

* It may not be resolved before there is a breakdown of the western nervous system under the strain of the Berlin **crisis**, leading to shooting and war.

* Any government consisting of practical men would have regard to the country's food reserves in a time -of- **crisis**, and keep two years' supply of wheat "on hand.

* The following letter from the Horsham Town Council emphasizes this point: - 
This 'brought about an economic **crisis** for the cable companies, whose huge capital investments were seriously prejudiced.

* The central banking fund will be held for the purpose of meeting a possible **crisis** in the banking system, and if such amounts that may be determined are not specified, the central banking funds may be seriously interfered with.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Menzies)  has put before the committee, not a resolution in connexion with the Victorian industrial **crisis**, but an elaborate, important amendment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* An important city of Australia is facing a **crisis**.

* But those who in 1930 had: to consider this matter in the light of the industrial disturbances of those days - the early years of the economic and  financial depression when Australia faced a period of extreme **crisis** - did not agree that those methods would be successful.

* It is time a halt was called to the negative approach to the so-called dollar **crisis**.

* Englishmen - Australians too - have been told, as each **crisis** in dollars is reached, that the only solution is more cuts in dollar imports.

* In the middle of last year, when France had been 'beaten back and Germany had invaded Flanders, when our own armies had been cut off for various reasons and driven back to Dunkirk, and when the evacuation from Dunkirk had taken place, there was a **crisis** which had no real precedent in the history of our race.

* I do not care how friendly the game may be, the meeting of **crisis** after **crisis** in Parliament must necessarily distract the minds of the country's leaders from the duties which at this time should be paramount.

* I lay upon the table the following paper : - 
The honorable member for Warringah  (Mr. Spender)  says that lack of production is the cause, but it is not lack of production that has brought into being the **crisis** of rising prices.

* I emphasize that this Government is not seeking any glorification of the Commonwealth Parliament through the Government, but is simply seeking a means to meet what may become a serious **crisis** - a **crisis** of the kind which has arisen in very many countries throughout the world.

* Mr. Playford  said - 
We are passing through a **crisis** to-day which I firmly believe will bring us to a better order of society in which we shall overcome the grave disorders inseparable from capitalism and vested interests.

* It was in the midst of this **crisis** that the idea was conceived of building up a war-time industry for China in small decentralized units, with the co-operative system as.

* The net effect is to leave one group of incomes only unaffected by the national **crisis**.

* Honorable members opposite may claim that this is an attempt to raise the sectarian issue, but it has already been raised and I maintain that, in a **crisis** of this kind which affects the fundamental liberties of the people, every one is called upon to state where he stands.

* I should have thought that, in view of the present **crisis** and the strategic value of this area - it is almost within gunshot of Australia - this officer would have been given status equal to, if not higher than, that of Governor of one of the Australian States.

* on the precautions taken in the recent **crisis**, the fact remains that the emergency demonstrated that Australia was unready to meet attack.

* The September **crisis** showed us with great clarity just what our own defences amounted to.

* Speaking of the economic **crisis** in 1931 he said - 
It is true that in 1$!

* )3 there was a bank **crisis**, following upon the breaking of a land boom, and that some hanks got into difficulties from which a number of them never emerged.

* The honorable member for Fawkner attributed this **crisis** in the coal-mining industry to three fundamental causes.

* I claim that the Government could deal only with the federation, and I believe that this **crisis** shouldlead - I hope that it will lead - to the federation putting its own house in order so as to obtain greater powers of disciplining its members.

* I was still satisfied that the banks would give me a fair go and as soon as the **crisis** was over would allow me to get back to where f was before.

* I believe that we are: heading;  fox  as economic, **crisis**^ that can.

* It was thought that in a time  of national **crisis** the National Parliament and the administrative departments, particularly the departments of defence, air and the navy, would be less liable to attack if situated inland.

* Many years have passed and Australia is facing the greatest **crisis** of its history, but those departments are still in Melbourne, there being only skeleton staffs in Canberra.

* This Government has introduced this bill at a time of unprecedented industrial **crisis**, when enormous demands are being made on our available man-power and materials, when we are in the midst of the worst drought we have ever  known, and when we are still engaged in war with Japan.

* Mr. Fisher  continued - 
I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether the Government will concentrate its activities at Canberra during the present war **crisis**; whether it will keep Parliament in continuous session, not adjourning except to a date to be fixed by Parliament; and whether it will arrange for the transport by air of Ministers and members representing distant constituencies?

* In this **crisis** it is not a matter of whether we belong to the Labour party, the United Australia party or the Country party.

* In India, it was considered necessary for  Sir Stafford  Cripps, in the depth of the war **crisis**, to consult with Indian national leaders.

* When matters reached a **crisis** they showed themselves to be, in fact, Pan-Asiatic nationalists, and  to  be prepared to collaborate with the worst form of imperialism the world has known - that of the Japanese, That still does not destroy the fact that there was in Java a consciousness, however slight, of some form of solidarity with the rest of Asia, and one fact wc cannot fob off is that the achievement of Chinese independence will be a stimulus to Asiatic nationalism everywhere.

* The food **crisis** in Great Britain is becoming worse every day.

* The food **crisis** in Great Britain is being accentuated by the inertia of this Government, and the object of my motion is to ensure that no further delays shall occur in giving assistance.

* First, we must ov'er"come the exacerbated **crisis** which has occurred as the result of the disastrous blizzards, the awful winter, and the consequent floods.

* Victoria is at present in the midst of an industrial **crisis**.

* This at the very time when the State is completely  disorganized as the result of the current industrial **crisis**!

* It is true that in 1893 there was a bank **crisis**, following upon the breaking of a land boom, and that some banks got into difficulties from which a number of them never emerged.

* But the **crisis** of 1893 taught some lessons; and it has to be said for the trading banks of Australia that they learned their lessons and can claim to have had a solid record ever since.

* Shortly after he became governor, he announced in a press interview that he wanted the bank to become like the Bank of England, and be able to stand behind the other banks in a **crisis**.

* The period was one of great **crisis** for the Australian fighting forces.

* In December, 1941, the Prime Minister  (Mr. Curtin)  said that the Government had decided that the best method of effective co-operation in the present **crisis** was to increase in certain respects the authority and functions of the Advisory War Council, and he added that in future its functions would cover the following :  - 
I asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, in a question without notice, whether the Australian Wheat Board had been consulted before the Government decided to become a party to this agreement.

* I shall not argue that our Australian surpluses of basic foodstuffs should' not be made available through- governmental or international agencies along lines which will show that the western democracies are not indifferent to the needs of humanity; and I certainly shall not argue that we should exploit our opportunities to- wring the- last penny out of the United King1dcm in its moment- of economic **crisis**; but I shall, and do, argue that whatever it is proper for the- Australian Government to arrange in either of these respects should be carried through by, and at the cost of, the Government, and not by seizing the property of private individuals and carrying out governmental policies at the cost of a limited number of private persons who happen to have chosen one industry as the scope for their activities.

* Surely, if there isnothing else we agree upon, we at least are agreed upon the necessity to aid theUnited Kingdom through its **crisis** and help in its re-establishment.

* I remind him that a state of emergency has been proclaimed in Queensland, but, although he is a member of the Executive, he has turned his back on the **crisis**.

* In this **crisis**, the Prime Minister should show all law-abiding citizens that he has the power and the determination to enforce thelaw.

* In the absence of the honorable member for the Northern Territory, I ask the Minister for the Interior whether he is aware that the Administrator of the Northern Territory has announced that Darwin is on the verge of a grave food **crisis**, and that supplies of tea, sugar, flour and general groceries are nearly exhausted?

* That is the position also in respect of the United Spates of America, a country to which we owe a perpetual debt for all that it did for the United Nations in the **crisis** of 1942.

* Young people who migrated here under the various schemes found they had no real brothers when the **crisis** came.

* It has a stronger conviction now than ever that in this time of dire national **crisis** we cannot do all that is required of us unless we do something to establish this industry in Australia forthwith.

* Since the outbreak of war, I have consistently advocated the formation of a national government, because the duty devolves upon every honorable member to pull his weight in this period of extreme **crisis**.

* None whatever, but the right honorable gentleman made statements to-night which conveniently left out certain things about this particular **crisis**.

* These men came forward, not in a dispute between employers and  employees  - they were not strike breakers in that sense - but at the request of the freely-elected government of the day which had declared: "In a period of **crisis**, we must keep the ships moving".

* If our programme had been adopted by the Government three years ago, and if provisions of the kind we suggested had been placed on the statutebook, we would not need legislation of the kind now before the House and have to " guillotine " it as a matter of urgency after a **crisis** had come upon us.

* It is quite obvious from the speeches that have been made on behalf of the Government that Ministers see the solution of this **crisis** in a war of attrition between the community generally and the coalminers.

* The fact that the members of the Government are unable to distinguish between the conditions that obtained in 1940 and those that obtain at the .present time shows how utterly unfitted they are to be in charge of the affairs of this country in a period of **crisis**.

* Under the heading " Food Crisis - 32 Countries in Bid to Beat Famine ", it publishes the following news item : - 
The International Emergency Food Council decided to-day to call a conference of the Food and Agriculture Ministers of the 32 member governments to plan means of combating the world food **crisis** during the next year.

* I pay tribute to the assistance given to the Government in this time of **crisis** by the Leader of the Opposition and many front bench .Labour members.

* Representatives of the trade unions are now in conference with the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  with a view to the industrial organizations assisting the nation in this **crisis** to the fullest degree possible.

* Those principles I shall not sacrifice; but anything that I can do to help this country during this **crisis** I am willing to do.

* Industries like those of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, and General Motors-Holdens Limited, in which millions of pounds are invested and which have so much to lose, must be marshalled in the interests of the nation in this **crisis**.

* Australia stood fast and remained true to the ideals for which the Empire stood when the **crisis** arose and this country was called upon to take part in these two great struggles.

* Honorable members on both sides are aware that Great Britain is facing a grave **crisis** that demands that immediate assistance be given to it by every one interested in the survival of Great Britain and the British Empire.

* Whether or not the suggestion can bie sustained, there is ground for the suspicion that the **crisis** may be due in some part to collusion between various interacts which are determined to discredit the whole system of pricefixing.

* There have already been indications that the dollar' **crisis** has been loaded against us.

* In speaking of the dollar **crisis** and other matters, he stressed that we should think first of Australia, and I agree with him.

* The sincerity of the honorable member for Warringah can be judged by his actions at the time of that great **crisis**, when he had the opportunity to have our troops returned to this country so that Australia would be served first, instead of other nationals being protected by them in preference to our own.

* The seething international position was such as to make this possible, because, if one method failed one day, there would sure to be a **crisis** in the next day or two, during which another method could be tried.

* If, however, the nation has credit resources which could be used within safe limits in time of **crisis** to preserve its financial equilibrium, surely there was never a moment in the history of Australia when their use was more justified.

* By raising a new loan the Government is postponing investment, and will thus prevent the development of an inflationary **crisis** of the first magnitude.

* Such a **crisis** would inevitably develop if the Government were to accept irresponsible suggestions for a sharp decrease of taxation at the present time.

* The Australian public has come to expect a coal **crisis** every year, especially in winter.

* Ever since 1946, a coal **crisis** has been an annual event.

* The coal **crisis** this winter is doubly harsh because of the devastating floods in the Hunter Valley and other parts of New South Wales.

* There is the Crimes Act, for instance, which the Government is not prepared to implement in connexion with the present **crisis**.

* It is from amongst such people that the core of an inspired public opinion will be formed which will stand the test of any **crisis**.

* The latter has proved himself at a loss before in a **crisis**, and is going through the same performance again, oblivions of hia previous incompetency and unconcerned about his blunders.

* Australia is fortunate that  Mr. Menzies  is not in power during the present **crisis**.

* I remind honorable members that during the coal **crisis**, the men who are employed on this 3-ft. 6-in.

* During the visit to Australia of Lord Addison, the then Minister for Commonwealth Relations, 1 understand that discussions took place between him and the Prime Minister, or a Cabinet subcommittee, about the dollar **crisis**, and food exports to Great Britain.

* T  pay  a tribute to thu Government for the wholehearted way in which, in a time of national **crisis**, it has applied itself to the defence of the country and to the organization of its resources so that the nation might play a worthy part in the struggle for freedom.

* While I pay tribute to those 'who have administered the affairs of the Commonwealth in this time of **crisis**, I also honour the men of the forces for the valour they have shown and for the uncomplaining way in which they have done their duty and helped to bring us to this day when we at least have victory in sight.

* The need to call to the bar of this House the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for examination regarding the international monetary position, with particular reference to the dollar **crisis**, Australia's international reserves, the price of gold, and international exchange problems generally.

* The present **crisis** is not the first **crisis** in relation to dollar problems.

* The first dollar shortage **crisis** occurred immediately after the war.

* The second **crisis**, which could be called the convertibility **crisis**, was overcome by certain action that adjusted the situation for the time being.

* We are now facing the fourth **crisis**.

* Had the Prime Minister given that lead, the present shortage of petrol, apart from the **crisis** caused by the coal strike, might never have happened.

* I should say to the Commonwealth directors on the board, "Look here, you tell all the other members of the board that we are invoking this particular provision to tell you that we do not want the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited to sell petrol in large and extravagant quantities during the present **crisis** ".

* I say that the Government has all the moral power and plenty of latent legal power to have said- to the directors of the organization, " Gentlemen, we are in a **crisis**.- We want this company to set an example to the other oil companies and not to embark upon excessive sales ".

* In 1940, the Menzies Government faced an industrial **crisis** on the coal-fields.

* Our predecessors, composed of the parties represented opposite, neglected to prepare this country against the present **crisis** by insisting on and assisting in the mechanization of the coal mines, although it must have been apparent that the world was moving towards a war which would demand the production of the maximum quantity of coal for vital industries.

* Is it a fact that the Postmaster-General, when Minister for Defence, stated, during the September **crisis** in 1938, that he had the satisfaction of being able to assure Cabinet from his awu personal investigations that Australia's military organization was complete for any emergency?

* The Government cannot expect to establish complete harmony while it  is  endeavouring to use the present **crisis** to introduce very questionable financial procedure in this country.

* Many of the smaller companies of which I have some knowledge have been unable to establish reserves to tide them over a period of **crisis**.

* If world prices fell many small businessmen and the shareholders of small private companies would have no alternative but to go on the streets because high taxes have made it impossible for them to establish reserves with which to meet such a **crisis**.

* When I think of the efforts put forth by' this country and its people during that period of **crisis** and reflect -that during this long debate all that could be said in criticism of the foreign policy of the Government was directed to one or two matters, out of.

* No country received greater % support from Australia than did the Netherlands East Indies during its period of extreme **crisis**.

* considerable suffering, merely because he said that in the .**crisis** in which Australia found itself, the United Kingdom being mainly concerned with the enemy in Europe, Australia looked to America, its great democratic neighbour in the Pacific, for aid.

* What we must get is the greatest degree of unity in the supreme matters, and we should always remember that, in a time of **crisis**, agreement or no agreement, treaty or no treaty, bargain or no bargain, the members of the British Empire stick together.

* The poster goes on to deal with the facts behind the **crisis**, the economic situation, and the racial and political position.

* And then the following matters are listed: - 
No one is more fervent in his desire that the Empirewill continue to play its part in international affairs than I am, because I believe the British Empire,, and' theMother Country in particular,, lias donemore than have other nations to- preservethe peace of the world in times of" **crisis**.. Great Britain has been, and will alwaysbe, a great leader of the peacelovingnations.

* I also ask the Government to consider urgently and seriously the possibility of securing alternative supplies of tin concentrates, solder, or whatever other materials may be necessary to prevent the development of the **crisis** which appears to be in prospect.

* I direct a question to the Prime Minister with reference to the acute **crisis** in relation to dollar funds, which affects both Australia and the United Kingdom.

* Last May, when the **crisis** had not reached its present acute form but was commencing to reveal itself, I asked the right honorable gentleman whether, as a means of conserving dollars, he would set up a committee to investigate the possibility of increasing the production of tobacco, the importation of which causes one of the very important drains upon our dollar resources.

* The economy of the country and the future of Great Britain  -  which is faced with a great **crisis**, as members of the Australian Country party must know, or would know if they were not irresponsible - do not matter to honorable members opposite.

* The United Kingdom provides the principal market for our wool, butter, meat and other primary products, and if it does not survive its present **crisis** Australia will be hard hit.

* At present, everything is subordinated to housing, but if a **crisis** were to arise to-morrow, and a few houses became vacant, we should not be able to arouse the interests of the people in housing, no matter how we tried, because it would not be fashionable.

* We are receiving some of this equipment, and it will be very useful to  us in this **crisis**.

* In the present **crisis**, no issues should divide the country or the political parties, because the only issue that matters is the winning of the war.

* In this **crisis** we cannot afford to concern ourselves with the point as to whether this or that industry should, or should not, be carried on.

* It is true that such control in war time may be justified, but I believe that there is a middle road in times of **crisis** by which the energy and enterprise of private business can be coupled successfully with government direction with good results.

* It would have been a reserved power to be used only in time of **crisis**.

* What a frightening thought that the people should give to their elected parliamentary representatives power to protect them against high prices in a time of **crisis** !

* The Leader of the Opposition skipped over the 1893 hank **crisis**, but it is important to examine how the private banks treated their depositors in this period.

* It mainly provided statistical data, but in paragraph 216 of its report it stated - 
Did your bank suspend payment dur ing the 1893 bank **crisis**?

* It has been stated that only one bank in Australia has closed its doors since the banking **crisis** of 1893, namely, the New South Wales Government Savings Bank.

* I was still satisfied that the banks would give me a fair go, and as soon as the **crisis** was over would allow me to get back to where I was before.

* He told us something about the Constitution ; but, finding himself hopelessly out of his depth on that subject, he swung to the subject of economics, and tried to convince us that the production **crisis** in Australia is not our fault, but has been brought about solely by the fact that we cannot import essential goods from overseas.

* He picked up the first primer on economics and said that the production **crisis** was not due to Australian production but to the failure of other countries to export.

* Even in time of great **crisis** the Australian Government recognized the existence of the federation of States and it said, " We shall allow the Governments, of South Australia and Western Australia to con-' trol rents within the borders of their States ".

* .- I believe, in common with the honorable member for Boothby  (Dr. Price),  that we are to-day facing the greatest **crisis** in our history.

* At a time of **crisis**, such as that through which we are now passing, the interests of individuals and companies should not be considered.

* In that **crisis** private enterprise was unable to rise to the occasion and give unselfish service to the country.

* It was the latter Government which recommended him for a knighthood in recognition of the service he rendered to the United Australia Party in helping to destroy by various disgraceful means the Labour Government led by the right honorable member for Yarra  (Mr. Scullin),  and also in helping to destroy the Labour Government of Victoria, t have no doubt that before this war ends the present Government will recommend  Sir Keith  Murdoch's elevation to the peerage foi- his alleged distinguished services to this country during this time of **crisis**.

* That was after the Munich **crisis**, and I ask honorable members to remember that, those on the Labour side of the chamber were always wise about the Munich **crisis** and always anticipated Nazi aggression, or so they would have us believe now.

* To-day, the Government proposes to ask the people to give to it the powers it requires to deal effectively with post-war problems, and I have no doubt that they are confident that the Government which has steered Australia through its greatest **crisis** by providing adequately for the.

* To those people, if they exist outside the imagination of the honorable member, I say that if power be not given to the Commonwealth Parliament to deal adequately with post-war problems, this nation, will very probably find itself confronted after this war with a **crisis** and a depression much more devastating and degrading than  wm  the depression of 1929-32.

* I do not' see how such controls as those over prices, wages, capital issues and land values could be removed without precipitating an economic **crisis**.

* This enthusiasm seems to be a good thing in these days of **crisis**.

* The **crisis**- 
We note that he refers to the matter as a **crisis** - leaves the Government no escape from the duty it owes to the nation of getting the quantity of coal required.

* That in itself constitutes an aggravation of the dollar **crisis** for Great Britain, because it will have to pay the interest on those American investments by means of exports.

* There are four factors involved in the dollar **crisis**.

* When the United States of America was making gifts in the immediate post-war years, at the stage when it had made gifts amounting to 8,000,000,000 dollars to the rest of the world, thereby solving the dollar **crisis** of that time because other countries did not have to pay for imports from the United States of America with goods of their own, the right honorable member for Cowper  (Sir Earle Page)  rose to his feet in this chamber and advocated a policy of rigid imperial preference.

* During and immediately after the war there was no dollar **crisis** because the United States sustained the British economy to the extent of one billion dollars worth of food a year, for nothing.

* The first **crisis** was that Britain was no longer receiving that American aid, which was cut off before Britain's industries could be reconverted to peace-time production in order to finance Britain's imports.

* The second **crisis** was that Britain suddenly had to assume great obligations in Europe.

* It is deplorable to hear from honorable members opposite this perpetual pretence that the socialist Government in Great Britain has caused the present economic **crisis** in that country.

* As economic factors enter more and more into the post-war situation the normal party  alinements  will show themselves more clearly, and as the immediate **crisis** passes the peoples of the nations will indulge themselves in the luxury of disagreeing on matters of detail connected with the foreign policy of their governments.

* If, iri the post-war years, we could have developed the cooperation that we displayed so readily when the **crisis** of war was upon us we could have done much to solve Great Britain's terrific economic problem.

* Having regard to the **crisis** that now faces Great Britain, does it not seem incredible that it is now more than sixteen years since the countries of the British Commonwealth met together for a full-dress economic conference?

* No effort has been made either by this Government or by the Socialist Government in Great Britain to pull the Commonwealth countries together in an economic conference which could perhaps solve almost entirely the **crisis** with which Great Britain is faced.

* I do not think it is fully realized even in Great Britain just how enduring and critical this **crisis** is.

* I believe that the worst of the **crisis** has not passed and that it has yet to come.

* Unless the British Commonwealth countries realize the enduring nature of this economic **crisis** and determine that they will pool their resources and deal one with the other as closely as they can, then, inevitably, in my view, Great Britain will crash, and we shall crash with it.

* Many public expressions of opinion show that the people realize that this Government can no longer serve them in the national **crisis** with which we are confronted, and that it will have to give place to a government more capable of administering public affairs.

* It has failed* to recognize its duty to the people, particularly in view of the grave **crisis** confronting us.

* I join in his tribute to  Mr. Beasley,  who had' to save almost every gallon of petrol during the terrible **crisis** of the war.

* We have to get something that will be a substitute in world trade for what  President  Roosevelt arranged in the **crisis** of war and in the great lend-lease plan.

* "When faced with a **crisis** in Queensland,  Mr. Hanlon  took the most drastic action.

* Now, I ask myself whether I have the right to be an independent, and what in this **crisis** an independent member is independent of?

* Public opinion in this country has demanded in no uncertain voice that in the present **crisis** Australia must have unity.

* Surely in the present **crisis** we cannot afford to accommodate people who profess to be pacifists, or who refuse to accept their fair share of responsibility in facing the greatest **crisis** which has ever confronted the Empire and Australia.

* It is only natural in a time of grave **crisis** for people to come together,' and shoulder their responsibilities as .a united body.

* I can assure the House that, whilst I yield to no man in my desire to protect the civil rights of persons in Australia, there are times of **crisis** when the safety of the people as a whole must override ordinary court procedure.

* That honorable member will at least be remembered as one who, when this country was approaching the present **crisis**, spoke constantly of the need for greater war preparations.

* Control over prices, rents and charges would also have been a reserve power to be used in times of economic **crisis** such as that through which we.

* The people of Great Britain have never faced a greater economic **crisis** than the present one, but I believe that they will win out.

* But the present is a -period of grave **crisis**, requiring extraordinary methods for the purpose of coping with the situation.

* Britain's meat supply situation is so critical that whatever efforts Australia may make toward meeting the **crisis**, the British Government will try to match these efforts in overcoming the ' shipping problem.

* The responsibility is, of course, the Government's; hut the Parliament should see that the Government does not shove this country headlong into a **crisis** that will mean industrial stagnation, the destruction of overseas trade and unemployment in many of our key industries.

* If necessary, the Parliament should remain in session until the Government has produced its plans to meet the **crisis**, and until the Parliament has approved or otherwise of such plans.

* We might call it a **crisis**.

* The Government, itself, refused to take any positive action to meet the **crisis**.

* No honorable member can afford to "' pass the buck " to a Treasurer, who is plainly bewildered and befuddled by the onset, of the **crisis**.

* The Parliament should not go into recess until the position has been clarified, and a considered plan to meet the **crisis** has been approved.

* **crisis**, they had pursued a policy of maintaining industry until it could adjust itself gradually to the altered economic conditions, Australia could have easily weathered the storm.

* In view of the dollar **crisis** and the great inflation in the United States of America and its effect on world conditions, an economic collapse seems inevitable.

* It would be wrong for the Government to await the onset of such a **crisis** and then try to implement a remedial policy under the dictates of private financiers.

* Notwithstanding these statements by eminent military strategists the Minister for Defence  (Mr. Dedman)  had the temerity to say in answer to a question which I asked about the attitude of the Council of Defence towards Australia's defence, that this country is better prepared to  meet a **crisis** than it has ever been before in its history.

* The dollar **crisis** has so curtailed travel that the line is now being run uneconomically, and, unless a subsidy is given to it by the Congress of the United States of America, or some .arrangement is made between Australia and the Government of the United States of America to keep  Marine Phoenix  on the run, possibly there will be no shipping at all between Australia and American Pacific ports at a very early date.

* Will the Prime Minister consider the removal of the seat of Government, temporarily, to Sydney, so that the Parliament will be on the spot to deal with the hour-to-hour emergency arising from the coal **crisis** and also so as to discount all suggestions that the members of the Parliament are not sharing in the general hardships and privations nowbeing experienced by the people?

* If a man encounters a financial **crisis** in his- business affairs, he can, if his business is sound, overcome his difficulties by borrowing.

* Australia should meet the present dollar **crisis** in the same way.

* On the other hand, when communism was in the open during the recent industrial **crisis** in Queensland,, i:t was defeated by a determined State.

* I arn not apportioning blame to either side in this coal **crisis**.

* Of course, many honorable members opposite would be only too glad to see a general hold-up of industry in this country in order that such a **crisis** might enable them to regain control of the treasury benches in this Parliament.

* During the **crisis** which faced the industry in 1940 honorable members on this side who were then in opposition did everything in their power to help the government of the day find a solution of the industry's difficulties.

* I have said sufficient to show that in that **crisis** his Government was impotent.

* In 1940, he said- 
These enemies utilize the coal **crisis** to cause divisions in the Labour movement, antagonize the middle class, and undermine the Curtin Government.

* In a way, that is  rather  a pity, not because the problem is not a grave one, but because the tendency has been to obscure the general economic **crisis** in which the people of the United Kingdom find themselves, of which the food problem is only a part, even though, perhaps,  it is the most important part.

* The hill sets out to do something on behalf of Australia towards easing that economic **crisis**.

* A little time can be usefully employed in examining that **crisis**, because, if the people generally have not yet fully appreciated its extent and gravity, I am certain that it is not yet fully appreciated by honorable members also.

* What represents an economic **crisis** for the United Kingdom, in the long run also represents an economic difficulty or problem which must be faced by Australia and other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

* It is quite easy to detect how the **crisis** has developed.

* Those of us who are supporting the bill have need to be satisfied that 'Great Britain requires this assistance, and I know of no better way to establish that fact than to examine the present economic **crisis** in Great Britain.

* If we are to play our part in meeting this Empire **crisis** we must face it as if it were a war **crisis**.

* At such a time we achieve a state of unity among members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that we do not seem to be able to get in time of peace; and I suggest that the reason is that we do not always realize how grave the **crisis** really is.

* Personally, I believe that it would be difficult to exaggerate the gravity of Great Britain's economic **crisis**.

* The same unity and co-operation which is possible in time of war for our self -protection and security must be manifested at the present time if we are to overcome this **crisis**, also.

* My other point is this: Clearly, there ought to be a co-operative effort by all Empire countries if we are to come successfully out of this **crisis**.
