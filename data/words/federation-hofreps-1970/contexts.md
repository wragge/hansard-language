## Contexts in which the word "federation" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* I want honourable members to compare that statement with the decision of the Government, led on this matter by the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden)  who has countermanded and overruled an agreement negotiated between the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, or the Australian National Line, and the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation** which contained provision for a 35 hour week.

* Interest rates are the highest since **Federation**.

* The fact that an ordinance of this kind has to be debated in this Parliament after some 72 years of **federation** and after the Australian Capital Territory has been in existence for well over 40 years is the strongest condemnation of this Government's inertia and complete failure to provide a proper and alternative system of making, laws for the ACT.

* In the 74 yean from **Federation** to 1974 government spending built up to a certain level; then in one year it was increased nearly 50 per cent on top of that.

* I would also like to compliment the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** on the way that it has handled the wheat industry.

* The honourable member for Lang has already quoted some of the comments made by the Manager of the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations,  Mr Arthur 
The motion moved by the Leader of the House  (Mr Snedden)  is significant enough in itself, but far more significant is the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns).

* Its representatives in the original Labor **federation** were elected to observe these principles and abide by them.

* One might say that an IBA solution would save them a great deal of that anxiety of which the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations tells us so often, about resolving a problem which they have found impossible to deal with in the past 22 years.

* It is the worst example of sectional discrimination ever visited on any single industry by any Treasurer as far as I can tell in the history of the **federation** of the Australian States.

* We find people from all walks of life, people from the middle class, from the wealthy sector of the community, when they cannot stop a building being destroyed, saying that they will have to connect with Jack Mundey and the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* Work on developing a proposed alternative framework for the Government' s consideration has been the responsibility of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference chaired by  Sir Richard  Kirby and attended by representatives of employers (the National Industrial Council, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and the Australian National Line), the Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia and my Department.

* Because the tendency dates back to **Federation** and has continued at varying rates through governments of the Right and the Left, we must look for innate causes as well as those of political commitment.

* In the commercial field, for example, it is worth taking account of the famous Keidanren which is a **federation** of economic organisations.

* The Australian Pensioners **Federation**'s policy is that the funeral allowance should be $200.

* Despite what the Minister has said, the Commissioner will have no power whatsoever to make any agreement with 'the Australian Teachers **Federation** on rates of pay, salaries or conditions.

* Until the advent of the Snowy scheme we had, in the 70 years since **Federation**, spent on all of the water projects in this nation less than we have spent on so-called defence projects in 1 year.

* In moving this amendment, I think the Opposition has overlooked the fact that it was provided quite specifically at .the request of the Australian Teachers **Federation** that appeals by teachers or their unions against determinations of the Commissioner go not to the Public Service Arbitrator but to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* The industry is represented by the Australian Dairy Industry Council, the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and the Australian Dairy Produce Board which does the exporting.

* It has been involved in discussions and negotiations with ship owners, the British Wool **Federation** and Interlaine.

* Surely that makes  Sir John  one of the most highly rewarded men in public life in this country, not only contemporaneously but also in the history of the nation since **Federation**.

* I repeat that the protection for the teaching profession in this area is the protection which the Australian Teachers **Federation** specifically asked for and with which the Government was happy to agree - it was not a question of granting a request as a decision had not been made in relation to this matter - and that was the right of appeal under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* Not only must it be between governments in a **federation**, the three spheres of government- Commonwealth, State and local- but also there must be greater cooperation between the vertically organised functional departments within a government.

* Discussions were held in Paris at the request of the British Wool **Federation** and Intertable which represent all those who own wool at the point of shipment.

* I understand that the Australian Wool Board has constituted a committee which is representative of the executives of the 2 principal national producer organisations, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, and that together the members of these executives through the committee are considering ways and means by which marketing change should and can be implemented.

* It is a House which is elected by universal franchise; it is a House which has a built in equality of State representation; and it is a House which, by reason of developments in recent years, is adopting for itself a role quite separate and distinct from the role of upper houses of the various States that make up the Australian **Federation**.

* This would seem to be in line with what the Australian Farmers' **Federation** particularly has been keen to see, namely, an examination of these matters outside the realm of purely party considerations or purely political considerations and based on a proper assessment of what is needed by industries.

* One should always remember that the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** recommended the current scheme.

* I am aware of the dispute the honourable gentleman mentions which, as he says, is a demarcation dispute between the Transport Workers Union and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The responsibility stems from the Parliament which, in a social matter of this kind must, from time to time, carefully examine the legislation and its application in the light of current community needs; and I remind the House that the regulations have stood  on  the statute book, in virtually the same form, since **Federation**.

* According to comments that I have heard from members of the Airline **Federation**, air cargo is regarded by Qantas as a second best sort of thing.

* We adopt that stance because we recognise that Australia is a **federation**.

* I know full well that the honourable member for Newcastle and other members of the Opposition, were they in Government, would never tolerate a select committee of the House of Representatives being responsible for what will be one of the most complicated policy decisions facing all of the governments functioning within this **federation** today.

* If the United Kingdom goes into the Common Market then the political identity of that country in the years to come will succumb and be lost within the framework of a European **federation**.

* On 9 November 1973, the Minister for the Environment and Conservation, referring to the imposing of green bans by the New South Wales Builders Labourers **Federation**, said that these were immensely effective and ought to be supported by every Australian who cared about the environment.

* Australia has the highest recorded interest rates since **Federation** and the most serious decline in economic growth since the post-war period.

* It was an employer which, as far back as the beginning of **federation** in 1901  -  nearly 70 years ago - introduced the principle of 3 week's annual leave.

* Three members are appointed from the ranks of the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**.

* This Bill is one of 40 or 50 Bills relating to referenda which have been introduced during the whole course of **Federation**, the Australian nation having been founded by dint of an Act of the Imperial Parliament in 1900.

* One of the points that is continually raised to me by various country stations and members of the **Federation** of Commercial Radio Broadcasters is the fact that the landline charges, which were increased quite dramatically two or three years ago, have stifled the dissemination of local information, of news and of other services to country people.

* I might add that 67 years after **Federation** we needed $6 billion of the taxpayers' funds for the national expenditure; we now need $26 billion.

* I instance the case of the Builders Labourers **Federation** in Victoria.

* Only in Sydney and Melbourne is any real interest being shown, and essentially even in those cities only 4 unions are active - the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Seamen's Union and the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia.

* I believe that it is the highest percentage ever allocated to social services by any government since **Federation**.

* the resolution which was passed by the Builders Labourers **Federation**- the claims are clearly outside the wage indexation guidelines.

* The Commonwealth Government has been involved in the development of science and technology in Australia virtually from the time of **Federation**, and has played a key role through the policies which it has developed over the years to meet the changing pattern of national needs and opportunities.

* I agree that International Transport **Federation** rates should be paid to all crews of international ships.

* If environmental impact legislation had been in existence since **Federation** the 8-year argument over Blackbutt Reserve would have been avoided.

* The Government ought to realise that the hardest job it has is marketing Malcolm Fraser as a believable commodity because he is now regarded as the most untrustworthy Prime Minister in the history of this **Federation**.

* That is why people such as  Mr Eckersley,  the  President  of the Australian Farmers' **Federation**, have said that it is little more than a joke.

* There will be no doubt in the minds of those organisations that there would be no place on a Schools Commission, staffed by a government in which the honourable member for Wannon was again the Minister for Education, for persons such as  Mr Ray  Costello, the  President  of the first Teachers **Federation**, who has been appointed to the Interim Committee by the present Minister for Education.

* I was amused, too, at the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  who danced quickly into the chamber a few minutes ago and just as quickly went out again and who hurled by interjection a statement relating to what  Mr Hogan  of the Australian Farmers **Federation** was reported to have said yesterday.

* Indeed, the annual report of the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations last year indicated that the Association saw no reason to believe that all stations would not be able to meet the new requirements.

* On another occasion, in answer to a question I asked, the Minister said he did not know of the opposition of the **Federation** of Commercial Television Stations to the project.

* We had the recent case on the waterfront in which the employers came to an agreement with the Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia for all sorts of new conditions and arrangements which suited both parties, but this is to cost $9m.

* For instance, Don Eckersley of the Australian Farmers **Federation** comments very favourably on the general thrust of the Budget but, quite properly, representing rural people, he draws attention to the matters to which I have been referring in the last few minutes.

* I think also of the advocacy of violence, threat and intimidation by  Mr Mundey  of the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* The decision gained the acceptance of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** and was endorsed by all State governments as parties to the complementary legislative arrangements supporting the orderly marketing and stabilisation scheme for wheat.

* The honourable member for Isaacs must know, as I and every other member of this House know and as the people of Australia know, that 28 questions have been put to the people of Australia since **Federation** and that only five of those questions have been carried.

* Notwithstanding that promise this Government has forced up the interest rate structure to the highest level since **federation**.

* From 2 p.m. until 6.45 p.m. last Friday we continually interviewed cross-sections of the community- mining interests, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Chamber of Commerce, the Junior Chamber of Commerce and various other people who said what they thought should be done with the air transport services between King Island and the mainland.

* I have since made an arrangement, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Housing, to see representatives of the Master Builders **Federation** and a number of other authorities concerned with building, on Friday morning.

* Certainly both the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Wool Growers Council representatives have seen me and spoken to me on this matter, but specifically the changes were made after consultation with the industry but not exactly in accordance with the ideas that industry put to me.

* This Bill represents the most far-reaching savage attack on free enterprise that we have known in the 73 years of our **Federation**.

* It was a record increase in any 12-months period since **Federation**.

* Here is a government with the biggest majority that any government has had since **Federation** and its Ministers are walking around making speeches to large seminars and forums and asking who is governing the country.

* I do not know whether the State of Victoria wants to run the whole **federation** and to say that it is speaking on behalf of all the States.

* As a member of the staff of the University of Tasmania at that time and an active member of the Staff Association, I had helped to prepare the case for the tutor and senior tutor levels for the **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations to present to the inquiry.

* -Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that as of Friday of last week members of the Transport Workers Union of Australia employed to service domestic airlines, members of the Storemen and Packers Union employed in some wool stores, nurses in New South Wales, members of the Storemen and Packers Union employed by drug suppliers and a large retail store in New South Wales, members of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union supplying supermarkets in Sydney, train guards in New South Wales, brewery workers in Darwin, workers in the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union at the General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd plant in South Australia, employees at soft drink plants in Perth and members of the Municipal Officers' Association of Australia in Western Australia employed by the State Energy Commission were either on strike or were threatening strike action?

* Yet the honourable member for Hughes parades himself in this Parliament tonight and speaks to the people of Australia as one in support of lower income taxation when he was a member of a government which increased taxation more savagely than any government in the history of this country since **Federation**.

* The other parties would be the stevedoring companies, the representatives of the shipowners, the Waterside Workers **Federation** and, on some occasions, clerks and some other ancillary labour.

* For the first time members of the Waterside Workers **Federation** were stood down as a result of other men being out on strike.

* It has been in office for less than 17 years in the 72 years since **Federation**.

* It has received an application from the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots for lockout bans to be written into the agreement.

* This proposal has the support of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** and the State governments, which provide complementary legislation for the machinery of wheat stabilisation and marketing.

* There is a section in it, section 41, that requires me to confer with the various State Attorneys on the subject to give them the option of setting up family courts within the various States of the **Federation**.

* The polls show that the support for the Labor Party is probably the lowest it has been since **Federation**.

* It was by government decision that the narcotics function was in the Customs area of its administration- such decisions, I might say, go back to **Federation**.

* The New South Wales Teachers **Federation** has written to me about the dismay caused by news of a Department of Main Roads proposal to take a substantial strip of land from this small site in order to widen Liverpool Road.

* A further point is that 2 years ago I could have promoted a discussion on a matter of public importance such as this because what the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch)  has said is applicable now was applicable when the Government of which he was a member went out of office; we had the highest interest rates we had had in Australia since **Federation**.

* -I am pleased to confirm, as my colleague the Minister for Transport indicated a couple of days ago, that following urgent action at the United Nations to consider the problem of hijacking the International **Federation** of Airline Pilots Association did decide to defer its strike action.

* In the end result, this great new system, this revolutionary change, the greatest revolution in the tax system since **Federation**, lasted only half a year.

* The Wool Commission was constituted specifically at the request of the members of the 2 principal national wool growing organisations, namely, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**.

* Of course, he pointed to the fact that the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia presently conducts courses through universities or other tertiary institutions.

* As a practical example of this type of consultation and co-operation, the Commission is presently examining the hospital facilities position in Australia and is being actively assisted by such bodies as the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**, the Australian College of Medical Administrators, the Australian Hospitals Association, the Australian Institute of Hospital Administrators, the Australian Department of Health, the Bureau of Census and Statistics and the health authorities in participating States.

* They had set up a new organisation, the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, which they refused to register under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; and they had gone to great lengths to frustrate any attempts to bring them back within the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* The inability of the West Pakistan authorities to assist and the indifference of the outside world undoubtedly played a part in East Pakistan's dissatisfaction with remaining in the Pakistan **federation**.

* The need for appropriate powers in relation to management initiated redeployment and retirement has, of course, always been recognised, and has been an accepted qualification to the permanent status of Commonwealth public servants since **Federation**.

* I have here a 14-page document issued by the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Mr Hogan, President  of the Australian Farmers **Federation**, has estimated that farm costs will increase by at least 25 per cent over the same 6 months period.

* This is the first time since **federation** that such an indepth detailed examination has been made by the Army of its own organisation.

* I am also having discussions with the Post-graduate **Federation** in Medicine, the College of General Practitioners and other bodies concerned with post-graduate training in genera] practice so that we can upgrade the status and the standards in this field.

* Let me remind the House that in the course of 1972 the money supply in this country underwent the greatest expansion since **Federation**.

* Queensland's outlying areas since **Federation** have been broadly contained within 3 electorates, a far northern electorate, a central electorate and a southern and south western electorate.

* It is a means of meeting the requirements of the three fund accounting systems operated by Australian governments virtually since **Federation** under the provisions of the Audit Act.

* It is the very strong view of the Government that it would be a good thing if the Australian Olympic **Federation** chose  Waltzing Matilda  for Montreal.

* By his attack on the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, it is the Minister who is playing politics.

* At the time I was told by the  President  of the Australian Cattlemen's **Federation** that I was politicking, but even he could not deny the basic truth in the prediction.

* In addition, Captain David Gray of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots had said that he was prepared to make another flight, and on 29 April, 30 Qantas pilots made similar offers.

* I never heard anybody, even on the other side of the House, suggest that the United States of America ought to change its name or suggest that in some way it was not a country which was made up of a number of States that had brought themselves together into a form of **federation**.

* In a dispute in Victoria a few years ago, because one member of a union involved in a power dispute- the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia which the honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned- the persons employed by the companies involved, namely the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd and General Motors-Holden's Ltd, and other vehicle builders union employing organisations in Melbourne which were neither in the dispute nor stood to benefit from the dispute, were all deemed to be ineligible for unemployment benefit.

* It is not anything other than a compact which all the Australian people voted for when the **Federation** was originally formed.

* (Quorum formed) Apart from one short period between 1913 and 1920, Australia has been without the Commission since **Federation**.

* He looked to the Master Builders **Federation** to conduct the survey.

* Those words would apply to any government which had the responsibility of ensuring the future of this nation and of its people, but regrettably on 13 December 1975 when the Fraser Government came to office it inherited an economic shambles, the likes of which this nation in its relatively short history of **Federation** has not seen this side of the Great Depression.

* In a little under two years this Government has done more in terms of special policies for Tasmania than, I think, any other government has done since the **federation** of Australia.

* As I understand it, it has been the invariable practice since **Federation** that in the case of adjustments in respect of company tax increases or reductions, as the case may be, the rate of tax applies in respect of profits which a company has earned in the year preceding the year in which the adjustment occurs.

* Secondly, I am distressed, as I indicated earlier today, by events surrounding the current strike involving the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the two Melbourne firms Seatainer Terminals Ltd and Liner Services Pty Ltd.

* It is just 200 years since Captain Cook discovered Australia, 182 years since Captain Phillip came with the First Fleet, 69 years since **federation**, and 25 years since the late Ben Chifley became Prime Minister of Australia.

* At this stage there is no reference but I am told that, as a result of representations made by the Australian Citrus Growers **Federation**, the volume of imports has been reduced significantly and I would hope that as a result there might be a recognition of the very valid fears that most citrus growers have throughout Australia.

* As the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  has repeatedly mentioned in this House and in numerous places outside these restrictions were applied at the instigation of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and were supported by the States.

* Whilst I acknowledge the difficulties involved, I deplore the approach adopted by the Minister for Transport, whose representative told the Australian Road Transport **Federation** annual conference in Hong Kong last September: 
I have bad experience in the teaching services and in the armed services, as a public figure and as a person who has marched down streets at the head of demonstrations, who has taken part in some that could have become violent, who has had long and close associations with the police force, in Victoria in particular, and in this community.

* The **Federation** has been in existence for about 70 years.

* The present Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  at the annual dinner of the Metal Trades Employers **Federation**, in front of the  President  of the Arbitration Commission, used that occasion to tell the Commission what its attitude should be in regard to the application of the unions for increased wages.

* I was talking about the difference in the increases in wages of people in certain brackets of income, involving some $3,000 and $4,000 a year and the amount of increase in the recent negotiated agreement between the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the employers of waterfront labour, involving, in the first year, an increase of $416 per annum and, in the second year, an increase of $208 per annum.

* The Australian Senate was set up for the sole purpose of enabling a **federation** of the States to take place.

* The Conference concluded that there was an urgent need to create greater awareness among international trade union organisations (in particular the International Transport Workers **Federation**) and among trade union officials in the Region, of the real problems and circumstances of the island communities in order to obtain their co-operation in working towards fair and reasonable conditions for those employed in the maritime services which will be consistent with the economic and social position of the peoples of the Region.'

* I emphasise that this has been a practice adhered to since **Federation** and I see no reason whatsoever why it should be changed.

* It is doing many things, but chiefly, for the Waterside Workers **Federation**, it will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.

* The decision gained the ready acceptance of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** and was endorsed by all State governments as parties to the complementary legislative arrangements supporting the orderly marketing and stabilisation scheme for wheat.

* It needs to be recognised that manufacturing is a much more important part of the economies of the larger States which after all, by their size and financial capacity, support the **Federation** in a very real sense.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, with great courage and with a great degree of responsibility, is facing up to this problem.

* I do not care what method is adopted, but it must be possible to find a more simple way of counting a division even if it is necessary to do away with traditions that have existed since **Federation** such as the alleged granting of VIP aircraft for leaders of the Australian Country Party.

* Section 62a of the Audit Act has existed since **federation**.

* It is certain that, at the Minister's request, the representatives of the **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufacturers were not permitted to discuss any of the details of this matter on Monday of last week.

* It is certain that the Department was not able - 
Never since **Federation** has a political party in Canberra been more justified in bringing down the guillotine than has been the case tonight.

* This was the highest incidence of indirect tax raising by any government since **Federation**.

* In addition to this I may say, for the information of the House, that the honourable member has asked me to meet a deputation from the Miners **Federation** this afternoon on this very matter and at a later hour during the afternoon we certainly will be discussing the matter further.

* What is also perfectly true is that they have to be the highest in absolute money terms because since **federation** this country has never seen a rate of inflation equal to that which we see at present because of the maladministration of this Government.

* The issue before this Parliament now is perhaps the most serious to come before it since **Federation**.

* Only on Tuesday  Mr Rod  Black,  President  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, called for tax cuts and a selective increase in government expenditure.

* These vary from day to day but range across such matters as the state of the economy, the Commonwealth's role in welfare, relations with the States - so important in a **Federation** - and external relations and defence.

* Municipal, city and shire councils have come a long way in the years since **Federation**.

* I am sure that all honourable members are appreciative of the fact that history is about to be created by the holding of a joint sitting of this Parliament for the first time since **Federation** and that the onerous duties of the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  are probably more onerous at this time than they have been for any Minister for a long time.

* In respect of the first group, I have already approached the Miners **Federation** and put the position to it.

* How many times since **Federation** have Independents sat in this chamber?

* Would an increase in the first payment of $66 per tonne to growers for wheat produced this year, as submitted by  Mr D.  R. Eather of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to the Government, stimulate the private sector during the traditional slack afterChristmas period?

* The increases in the maximum rates of levy have been requested of the Government by pig producers through the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**.

* I have discussed the work of this Committee with John Bennett, the  President  of the Austraiian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and one of the four dairy farmer representatives on the Committee.

* Up to date there has not been any major thinking in the dairy industry on this matter apart from that of the Australian Farmers **Federation** which has been trying to formulate plans for curtailing production, As a result of the discussions that I have had - I had .

* Is the Prime Minister aware of the close historical links between Australia and Israel, particularly in relation to the United Nations recognition of Israel and the current close links between Histradut, the Israeli Trade Union **Federation**, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the mutually beneficial results which have occurred as a result of this?

* Of course, the significance of this is that although Gove is not a port at which there is a register for waterside workers at the moment, once a possible demarcation could arise it would be open to the Waterside Workers **Federation** to seek the registration, for example, of the port at Melville Bay under the Stevedoring Industry Act.

* The complex industrial situation that has arisen insofar as the Miners **Federation** is concerned is some cause for concern, although domestically the production of power and the coal requirements of industry have not been affected so far.

* On no occasion since **Federation** have the Australian people been given such a clear opportunity to gain effective and permanent control of the Australian Parliament.

* -Did the  Deputy  Prime Minister recently meet  Mr Noel  Hogan,  President  of the Australian Farmers' **Federation**, during which a number of matters related to rural industries were discussed?

* We do not mind whether it be in this Parliament or outside the Parliament, whether it be in the parks or in halls or in any forum, our position on electoral reform, our position on the rights of voters, our position on the rights of citizens and civil liberties, stand head and shoulders above anything that honourable members opposite have stood for since **Federation** under whatever given name they took to themselves in that period.

* Such pious statements cover only thinly the real intentions of the most cynically antipeople, anti-labour, anti-progressive government this country has known since **Federation**.

* In this context I draw attention to the current activities of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia, which is perhaps the most obvious example of labour monopoly currently operating in Australia.

* It may have been that back benchers were influential at some stage in the history of **federation**, but I doubt it.

* It represents a political response by a Government which, by its own economic mismanagement, forced interest rates to their highest levels since **Federation**.

* What would be the case if an organisation such as the Institute of Public Affairs or a trade union such as the Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia placed advertisements in newspapers or on television away from election time?

* In the history of the **Federation** it has not had more than 10 per cent of the vote.

* Since **Federation**, the highest number of Bills passed by both Houses in a whole year was 157 in 1968.

* We have had the experience, not only with financial Bills but also with other Bills, of the Senate in this Parliament and the last Parliament rejecting or unacceptably amending more Bills in 3 years than previously since **Federation**.

* The Minister had much to say a few moments ago about how he was responding to representations from the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents but he made no mention of the Newcastle United Leisure Club which is represented in the travel field by a vice-president of AFTA,  Mr Jim  Jenkins.

* The judges awarded the prize to the Port Kembla branch of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia, controlled by the Communist Party, and the Minister had the honour of presenting the cup to  Mr Roach.

* There has not been a single member of this House since **Federation** who has committed so many dishonourable acts right in this House.

* The Government considered the position of the teachers and they will come under the authority of their own **Federation**.

* The attitude that the industry has to  Mr Anthony's  suggestion is summed up by  Mr Rod  Black, the  President  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**: 
The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Livestock Slaughter Levy Act 1964.

* In addition the Producer Consultative Group and the Exporter and Abattoir Consultative Group provided for in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill 1977 substitute for the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council for the purpose of recommending to the Corporation rates of levy payable under the Act.

* This should be the richest country in the world, given our benefits of stable climate, resources and a democracy that has been stable since **Federation**, since the start of Australia, largely by the efforts of the working class.

* If I look back over 70 years of **Federation** I can see that in all issues where Australia has gone to war it would be true to say that the Parliament was ill informed at the time.

* The .complaint of high charges for relaying programmes is also made by the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations in its annual report for 1969.

* I advise the House that the Minister was approached by a national student organisationthe Tertiary Catholic **Federation** of Australiaon 5 March, 6 April and 25 April about this matter.

* However, the Australian Citrus Growers **Federation** maintains that based on the 1978 cost movement, the efficient grower requires a minimum return of $100 per tonne if the industry is to have any chance of retaining its viability.

* I imagine that any sort of development of an open university with a reinforcement of external studies with all sorts of modern techniques and a **federation** of universities to do this sort of work- I do not want to anticipate the report but that is a possibility- obviously would be a method of encouraging this sort of student.

* Yet I understand that since **Federation** no member of Parliament has been prosecuted for breaking this law.

* Now the honourable gentleman talks about the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations and the fact that  Mr Malone  has sent in some amendments.

* It also needs to be noted that during the term of office of this Government, for the first time in the history of **Federation** in Australia, the number of Commonwealth public servants has actually fallen by a very significant amount.

* It goes back almost to **Federation**, and it is of interest to those of us who come from Western Australia.

* The new salaries and conditions for pharmacists were agreed with the staff associations concerned (Professional Officers' Association, Hospital Employees' **Federation** and Repatriation Department Medical Technologists' Association) on a without prejudice basis and were incorporated in consent determinations issued by the Public Service Arbitrator.

* -This clause continues to be opposed by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and by the Cattlemen's Union.

* This provision has not been availed of since **Federation** by any common informer, the name usually given to applicants in suits of that kind.

* I must say that  Sir Robert  Menzies, one of the great politicians of our age or, for that matter, since the days of **Federation**, even with all his wisdom, skill and powers of persuasion did not try to bring together the elections for the Senate and the House after 1954.

* All parties, Labor, Liberal and our own Party, until recently supported provisions which would have allowed the electoral laws which have applied since **Federation** to be maintained.

* It ill becomes the Leader of the Opposition, a former Treasurer, to start to talk about the comparative taxation records of this side of the House and his party when it was in government, as it presided over the largest and most automatic increase in personal income tax collections in any three-year period that this country has known since **Federation**.

* As the honourable members would know, Airlines of New South Wales or Ansett Airlines of Australia made a press statement which clearly indicated that the reason for Ansett 's withdrawing its services was the tactics employed by the Australian Pilots **Federation**.

* What the honourable member failed to point out was that the Liberal-Country Party Government during its administration of 23 years created the greatest number of socialistic enterprises ever created in one period of continuous government since **Federation**.

* Is the Minister aware of allegations that the guidelines for the operation of the access radio station 3ZZ which prevent the use of the station by political parties have been violated by representatives of the Italian organisation FILEF, the **Federation** of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families, and by an official of the Communist Party of Australia who has been a political candidate for that Party?

* So that these allegations can be proved or disproved, will the Minister give immediate instructions to the Australian Broadcasting Commission to give me access to the tapes or texts of the relevant access broadcasts which the ABC, despite repeated requests, has so far failed to provider 
I particularly support the incorporation in  Hansard  of the publications sent to us by the **Federation** of Polish Organisations of Victoria and also the sentiments expressed in the open letter written by 59 Polish intellectuals to the  Speaker  of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic.

* I am informed that this is a practice which has gone on almost since **federation** on the eve of a Budget.

* I am pleased to inform the House that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** has unanimously endorsed the Government's decision.

* The election results of 13 December last clearly vindicated  Sir John  Kerr's actions in pulling the political plug on the worst government since **Federation**.

* This is one reason why the Australian Farmers **Federation**, the United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association, the Victorian Farmers Union and all of these grass roots bodies in the community support the legislation which is presently before the Parliament and which incidentally is supported by the overwhelming majority of the members of the Parliament.

* However, the local State member and Teachers **Federation** officials inform me that in recent months a constant flow of money has been available for new buildings, heating and lighting, teaching aids, slow learners assistance and a host of other improvements that were never available in previous years.

* Perhaps sometimes he should realise that first and foremost since **Federation** Queensland has been part of the Australian nation, even if the Premier of Queensland will not accept the fact.

* It is essential that members of my Party have access to those reports, because when the Minister and the Government bring in substantive legislation in the spring session we would like to have had the advantage of studying the report during the winter recess to make ourselves familiar with it and to confer with the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and other waterfront unions- I understand that there is already agreement on it- on the basis of the report.

* The Teachers **Federation** and its cohorts tried to claim that simply because the Government did not accept all of the expenditure recommended by an advisory committee there had been a cut.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and relates to the very serious demarcation dispute between the Transport Workers Union and the Waterside Workers **Federation** over the right to moor vessels in the port of Burnie and some other Tasmanian ports.

* I think that they should face up to the fact that they will have to compete more and that they will have to do their bit and go along with the proposals of the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Wheatgrowers **federation** and the Government.

* Why was  Mr H.  L. Davies, Senior Dairy Officer in the Department of Research and Specialist Services, Salisbury, who was invited by the Australian National Dairy Committee to attend the 54th International Dairy **Federation** Congress in Sydney refused permission to enter Australia?

* Since **Federation**, and before the Country Party came into existence, the electoral laws dealing with distribution have provided for permissible variation in the number of electors in divisions of 20 per cent upwards and 20 per cent downwards from the quota.

* By looking at a table on presentation costs and cost of production drawn up by the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** of Tasmania it will be seen that the cost of a carton represents quite a substantial part of the cost of production and presentation costs.

* It is authorised by the Australian Pensioners **Federation** whose National  President  is  Mr Alan  Wilson.

* The petition reads: 
In view of his statement to the House on 21st October 1970 (Hansard, page 2540) that his Department has the co-ordinating responsibility for the industrial policy of those departments and instrumentalities which have relativity to outside industrial areas, and that the Public Service Board has the co-ordinating responsibility for other types of departments, will he (a) give the date on which this demarcation of responsibility was adopted by the Menzies Government, (b) state whether his Department endorsed or authorised the action of Commonwealth Hostels Ltd in appealing against the decision of  Mr Commissioner  E. J. Clarkson in awarding equal pay to female employees and to abolish the interstate differences between wage rates for male and female workers, (c) state whether his Department exercised its co-ordinating responsibilities when the Public Service Arbitrator made a consent determination for the Chief Civil Engineer, Chief Mechanical Engineer and Special Service Engineer employed in the Commonwealth Railways awarding salary increases in line with those rejected by the Public Service Board for Professional Engineers, (d) state whether his Department opposed the decision of the Stevedoring Industry Authority to award 4 weeks' annual leave at loaded rates for members of the Waterside Workers' **Federation** and (e) state whether his Department has ever sought to influence the Public Service Board in the way it carries out its coordinating responsibilities.

* Figures provided by the Australian **Federation** of Credit Unions suggest that from 15% to 20% of their loans are for land and housing purchases and about 15% for home improvements.

* These hours have applied since **Federation** and bad their origin in the conditions applying in the State Public Services.

* The debate took place on the television program 'This Day Tonight' and it was between the honourable member and  Mr Jack  Mundey, a person who is well known to the people of Australia as being the then communist secretary of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* The fact that 20 per cent variation has been the rule since **Federation** ought not blind us to its inequiti.

* For the Australian people - for this country - it has been a year of progress and reform on a scale unmatched in the records of this **Federation**.

* The measures that are put into this House which go to the Senate, sometimes to be rejected there, sometimes to have amendments made there and sometimes to pass there, cast a burden of legislative activity on the office of Parliamentary Counsel which has never been equalled in the history of Australia since **Federation**.

* I have seen reports in the Press this morning concerning the choice of the Australian Olympic **Federation** for the tune, song or anthem to be played at Montreal.

* The businessmen's group includes  Mr Espie, President  of the Australian Mining Industry Council, who will be leader of the group;  Sir James  McNeill,  Chairman  of Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd;  Sir Samual  Burston,  President  of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council; Professor Badger,  Chairman  of the Australian Science and Technology Council;  Mr Neville  Blyton,  President  of the Australia/China Business Co-operation Committee;  Mr Eather,  past  president  of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and General  President  of the Queensland Grain Growers Association;  Mr Gough, Deputy Chairman  of the Trade Development Council;  Mr Harris, Chairman  of the Australian Sugar Board; and  Dr Hughes, Chairman  of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.

* Has he had brought to his attention the strong representations of, for instance, the **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufacturers against the present very substantial implicit subsidy attaching to each luxury car sold in Australia under the existing depreciation and lease provisions?

* This week I will be meeting with the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the Australian Farmers **Federation** and will be seeking their points of view as to the rules and principles which should be- adopted in carrying out such a review.

* The present Government has given greater recognition to the Surf Life Saving Association in Australia than has been given by any previous government since **Federation**.

* The unbridled ambition of the Leader of the Opposition, a man who has destroyed two friendsone a Prime Minister and the other a Leader of the Opposition- has pushed this country to the brink of the most serious constitutional crisis since **Federation**.

* So consultations were held between my Department and the AttorneyGeneral's Department following further representations received at that time by Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents Ltd, of which Jetset is a member, in the form of a bitter complaint that no action was being seen to be taken against a discriminatory practice of kick-backs by the ACTU Jetset scheme.

* I think the record of this Government over the past three and a half years in paying regard to the welfare of Australian families in its Budget decision-making and in looking to the interests of Australian families compares very favourably with the record of any government since **Federation**.

* Are the new quota concept and first advance payments a thinly disguised sop to the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, designed to disguise the fact that the Government has in effect abandoned quotas for this year, but at the same time protecting the Treasury from an open ended first advance commitment?

* Representations have been made not only by the honourable member for Casey but also by the Victorian Council of Churches, the Victorian **Federation** of Mothers Clubs and many people in the community and I share their concern.

* I refer particularly to the electorate of Swan because without the agreement on the then trans-line it is doubtful that Western Australia would have joined the **federation**.

* I suspect that even the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  could go and have a look at the ballots conducted by the Waterside Workers **Federation** or by the miners or the seamen.

* I hope that if Queensland ever joins the **Federation** we will have a much closer relationship with it in the future.

* How galling it must be to lead a party that has been in Opposition for 22 years; how humiliating to lead a party that in  70  years of **federation** has been out of office for over  50  years.

* Never before in the whole history of **federation** has there been put through this House with such indelicate haste a measure of this nature.

* The Government has made financial contributions to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood **Federation**.

* The Committee, which includes representatives of the Diabetes **Federation** of Australia, the Australian Diabetes Society, the Australian Medical Association and physicians in charge of diabetic clinics resolved not to alter the present Australian standard insulin syringe (AS T29).

* We have had a **Federation** and a national Parliament - an embryo nation, I suppose - since 1901, that is, 72 years.

* One of the interesting features of this whole debate, apart from the contributions made by Country Party supporters, is that both the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  and I as the Minister representing the Minister for the Media have not received one protest about this increase from the **Federation** of Australian Broadcasting Stations and we have not received one protest from any broadcasting station throughout Australia.

* I said earlier that they have been behaving like a mob of reckless delinquents and if they have any respect, any feeling for the Australian wheat industry or any concern for the possibility of a large crop this year and for difficulties in the selling of that crop, on this issue they ought to do as the Leader of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** suggested: 'Sit down and shut up'.

* I should like to recapitulate in very short terms the concern expressed to me by the States and by the road **federation** bodies throughout Australiathat is, the transport operators- that the Bill gives the Commonwealth Railways, or the Australian National Railways Commission as we perhaps now should call it, power much wider than that required for the purposes which the Bill is said to enact.

* For that reason I move: 
-The Australian Wheat Growers **Federation** put that proposal to the Government.

* Within the limits of this speech, the foregoing is an over simplified exposition naturally, but it is at the practical root, I believe, of the Government's disinclination to impose target dates, and that accounts for its policy - which is correct, in my view, on both philosophical and pragmatic grounds - to expedite development throughout the Territory so that, when the people determine for home rule, there will be, first, some prospect of a national outlook; secondly, some prospect for cohesion against secession movements - there are at least 4 active in Bougainville, the Gazelle, the Highlands and Papua - and personal ambitions for leadership, but perhaps they can form together a **federation**; and, thirdly, some prospects of government under a democratic system rather than relapse into army or political dictatorship under some strong man, a few of whom can be seen today striving mightily with the cry.

* The corporation power, of course, extends right back to **Federation**.

* Not long ago, for instance, the **Federation** of Adelaide Metropolitan Residents' Associations published comments by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden")  and also comments by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren).

* We had been a **federation** then for 67 years.

* After 72 years of **federation** $ 10,000m was required to fund the national expenditure.

* Why should we not pass a Bill which will give the people of Australia, for the first time in our history since **Federation**, absolute and complete control over these assets which are of such great importance to the Australian people?

* It has had this responsibility ever since **Federation**.

* The terms of settlement of the Trans-Australia Airlines dispute have not previously been made public, but in view of the fact that quite a number of the travelling public believe that the terms of settlement did not involve the lifting of the threat of lightning strikes without notice, it is proper that I should make it quite clear that, among the terms of settlement which led to the return of the pilots to their normal duties, the **Federation** of Air Pilots gave an unconditional guarantee that it would not engage in lightning strikes, and that persons who buy passenger tickets on Trans-Australia Airlines' nights can be assured that they will travel on the day that they wish to travel and will be brought safely back home again.

* Had our proposal operated since **Federation**, 2 proposals which were defeated would have been carried.

* The privilege of electing representatives to the Senate has been exercised by voters in 6 States since **Federation**.

* The New Settlers **Federation** of Australia, the Secretary of which is  Mr Baltinos,  is also in on the racket.

* The Minister for Finance  (Mr Eric Robinson)  will appreciate that the State College of Victoria is, in a sense, a **federation** of teachers' colleges in Australia with the status of colleges of advanced education.

* However, that does not mean to say that the men in the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** - in other industry - who are put out of work because of a strike at Yallourn should be penalised.

* As the honourable gentleman would know, there are many items in the tariff schedule which have been there perhaps since **federation**.

* I draw to the attention of honourable members that Tasmania, with about 3 per cent of Australia's population, has within a few decimal points or so maintained fairly constantly 3 per cent of the Australian industrial population since the beginning of industrialisation in Australia, certainly since **federation**.

* Whilst I do not agree with everything that the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  does, I think that he, his Department and the Austraiian **Federation** of Airline Pilots made a wise decision recently in connection with banning a film which concerned hijacking and which some of us who were interested saw at a special screening at the National Library.

* Is the Minister aware also that the Secretary of the Western Australian branch of the Hospital Employees **Federation** of Australia, by coercion and intimidation is attempting to compel about 60 female hospital assistants to join that union?

* The Minister for Repatriation and Compensation has been in constant touch with the representatives of various different organisations representing insurance companies operating in Australia, and with the Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation**, and has invited these organisations to make suggestions to him as to amendments to the BUI, including necessary transitional provisions, and has undertaken to take such reasonable advice as he may receive from these quarters.

* We are a much less effective **federation** than, say, Canada or even, I think, the United States of America because great areas of conflict have developed between ourselves and the so-called sovereign States.

* I am a great supporter of primary producer organisations such as the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* He is the one whom the Government should bs considering by standing up to the big chiefs in the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* In the history of our **federation**, there has never been the sort of investigation that I suggest.

* If the obvious pressure that would come in such circumstances were to be accepted by an Australian government or by the management of any particular concern, and they said that they did have a special obligation, they would probably put off people belonging to the Vehicle Builders **Federation** or other Australian unions.

* The American **Federation** of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organisations testified that between 1966 and 1971 American-based multinationals transferred over 900,000 jobs based on union wage rates in the United States to low wage areas in Asia.

* The proposal for an art gallery for Canberra is almost as old as **federation**.

* I was impressed by how he was able to prove that the quota system is really knocking the small farmers, of whom there are so many, and that the big wheat growing interests, small in number but very powerful within the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and within the Australian Country Party, have been able to force the spread of quota reductions over the whole industry so that the little man, the man whose capacity to grow wheat even if he were given the right to grow all he could, would not give him a handsome income, has now been forced to reduce the capacity of his farm.

* I think this was referred to by the former Minister for Primary Industry when he opened the annual meeting of the Apple and Pear **Federation** conference in Hobart last year.

* The history of the Census and Statistics Act 1905-1973 goes back to the very early days of **Federation**, and the Opposition is aware that there are provisions in that Act relating to privacy, fidelity and secrecy.

* The Bill provides that any action to prescribe additional oilseeds for the purpose of the levy and any change in the operative rate of levy shall take into consideration any relevant recommendation of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** which incorporates within its organisational structure an oilseeds committee representing growers in the oilseed producing States.

* I am talking about Parliament in terms of the Australian **Federation**.

* The amendment moved by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  is as follows: 
Setting aside the constitutional difficulties which exist in our **federation** where States rightly claim areas of authority - though we all know that the Labor Party does not want the States to have any authority - one finds in these economic arguments a great tendency to brush aside constitutional problems, even by Labor Queen's Counsel.

* Has his attention been drawn to the statement by T. A. Dalton, Vice-President of the Master Builders **Federation**, that the action taken by the Government with the State Premiers was inadequate to stimulate the building industry?

* In New South Wales green bans have been imposed by the Builders Labourers **Federation**, and 10,000 people have been stood down as a result of the bans.

* I have had many talks with representatives of the Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation**, which is the union which covers most of the administrative and clerical employees of the private insurance companies.

* I shall quote from a letter dated 25 May 1977 which I received from  Mr Giovanni  Sgro, the secretary of the Italian **Federation** of Migrant Workers and Their Families, known as FILEF.

* The loan will have raised in excess of $760m, which is a record for a cash loan in Australia since **Federation**.

* I have in front of me a telegram, a copy of which was no doubt sent to the Minister for Social Security, from the South Australian Public Service Association, the South Australian Government Superannuation **Federation**, the South Australian Government Superannuated Employees Association and the South Australian Institute of Teachers - most of which bodies I should have thought would have been Labor supporters and would have come out in support of the Labor Government during the last election campaign - expressing disenchantment with the Labor Government for welching on yet another promise that it made to them concerning fixed incomes.

* In the first 20 years after **Federation** the Clerks of the Parliament were amongst the highest paid of the permanent heads and suffered only a slight decline in their salary relativity in the ensuing 20 years.

* The new system of family allowances, which is helping 300 000 families and over 800 000 children, was and is hailed as one of the most far-reaching social reforms in the history of **Federation**.

* The reform that was introduced last year, to change the basis of family allowances, I believe, was probably the most significant single social welfare reform since **Federation** especially to help women.

* After all, the 3 years that the Australian Labor Party was in office were probably three of the greatest wrecking years since **Federation**.

* Whatever may be said today to be the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the Australian Labor Party - whichever is chosen for the purpose of the day - the fact remains that the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who led for the Opposition in this debate, is recorded quite clearly as addressing members of the Vehi cle Builders Employees **Federation** in these terms: 'The policy of the Labor Party in government would be to make available to the unions all the resources of the Department of Labour and National Service; it would intervene in all cases before arbitration tribunals for the purpose of achieving a 35-hour week in industry'.

* The court house was acquired from the State of Victoria in 1870 and the post office was transferred to the Commonwealth at the time of **federation**.

* It was also rather pleasing to hear the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  express his concern in a speech to the Australian Farmers **Federation** recently at the emergence of what he termed 'malcontents' and 'demagogues' to lead disgruntled farmers.

* One would have thought that the universities and colleges of advanced education fitted into a compatible group because of a similarity in structure and in many of their courses; but I would remind the House that only last year when the matter of academic salaries for staffs at universities and colleges of advanced education was brought before the Academic Salaries Tribunal the General Secretary of the **Federation** of Staff Associations of the Australian Colleges of Advanced Education was moved to comment in writing to the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers)  that in August he had advised the Minister of the serious educational implications that would flow from tacit acceptance of the Tribunal's findings.

* I talk of the Italian organisation called FILEF (**Federation** of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families) which until this year had been serving a purpose which the present Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said was valuable among Italian migrant workers in Melbourne.

* We have provided in the Bill that any internal waters as at **Federation** do not come within the ambit of this legislation.

* Australia is a **federation** and many of the powers concerning energy rest with the States.

* The Commonwealth has had a jurisdiction in marriage and divorce since **Federation**.

* I think that is unfortunate because one of the things that ought to happen in a **federation** in which there is more than one level of government is the establishment of systems and laws which require consultation, require negotiation and prevent the kind of self-willed decision making which this Government has become typical for and noted for in a number of fields.

* I point out to honourable members the close connection between various Government supporters and various sections of the ALP with the World **Federation** of Trade Unions - a communist international show which seems to control policy.

* I spoke to representatives of the Waterside Workers **Federation** in Brisbane on the following Monday.

* It ignores the expertise that has been accumulated in the States, which have had the responsibility since **Federation** for dealing with matters relating to transport, and public transport in particular.

* The payment of family allowances as opposed to the old system of tax deductions, which helped the wealthy as opposed to the poor, was one of the most significant social advances in alleviating poverty in the less well-off sections of the Australian community that this country has seen in all the years since **Federation**.

* It shows, since **Federation**, the date of birth of all our judges, the date of appointment, the age on appointment, the age of cessation and, at the other sad end, their age at death.

* In relation to the Builders Labourers **Federation**, which the Minister has mentioned, will he confirm that that union was forthwith suspended from the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council at the instance of the officials of the Council, who are all members of the Australian Labor Party and that that union was allowed to take part again in the affairs of the Council only on condition that those thugs amongst its members who had disrupted the Council's proceedings never thereafter were allowed to be officers or delegates of the union?

* I ask the Minister whether he will confirm that when members of the Plumbers Union- 
The redistribution provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which, until 1965 - remember this, those in the Country Party who criticise - had stood virtually unchanged since **Federation** were altered in such a way that the principle of substantial equality of representation between electoral divisions was almost eliminated.

* His  desire to represent that city, to bear that title, as only its third representative since **Federation**, was part of the reason for his comparative lateness in entering this House..

* George Meany,  President  of the American **Federation** of Labor- Congress of Industrial Organisations says: 
The Bills we are now considering bring to a close a chapter of Australia's history that is as long as **Federation** itself.

* On 4 July 1945 in introducing the Papua-New Guinea Provisional Administration Bill he had this to say: 
The honourable member for Petrie talked about the worst inflation, the worst economic conditions, the worst industrial disputation and the worst unemployment since **Federation**.

* I would hope, and I know that the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents would join me, since its members are, after all, the travel industry, that it would be in a position to have some say as to who are to represent it on the board.

* Just imagine that- there was a gradual increase in government spending from **Federation** up to 30 June 1974 and then last financial year this amount was increased in one year by nearly half as much again.

* The  President  of the National Farmers **Federation**,  Mr Don  Eckersley, has written to me about the matter which the honourable member raised, asking the Commonwealth to take some action to see whether the Americans might lift their ban on imports of kangaroo products into that country.

* Unfortunately, because of the expressed rights of the colonies at the time and because they felt there was a need to have a States House, which after **federation** rapidly became a Party House, the situation developed- and it exists at the present time- where the Senate in certain circumstances could refuse Supply and thus force the House of Representatives to an election without having to go to an election itself.

* Not since **Federation** has the nation had a leader who has been so extravagant in indulging his personal whims and love of the good life.

* It so happens that some States are very antagonistic to the Labor Party and if they had not had equality of votes in the Seante they would never have joined the **Federation** in the first place.

* What happened was that the Builders Labourers **Federation** was on the warpath again.

* The **Federation** said to the Commission: 'We work within the system.

* At the same time that the **Federation** was doing that, of course, it had on foot a log of claims demanding an extra $35 a week in wages, a 35-hour week, and numerous other claims which were contained in that log.

* The **Federation** said so far as that log is concerned: 'We will not work within the system to get our demands under that log; we will work outside the system.

* He has received telegrams from the Waterside Workers **Federation** - not a union unfriendly to the Minister, nor he to it - which has some sort of friendly society or hospital society which also is caught up in this bind.

* New South Wales Teachers' **Federation** Health Society- C. Rennie, J. George, B. Manefield, A. L. Vance, D. Haywood, L. Gapps, J. Hennessy, E. Sheehan, B. Watterson, M. Taylor, L. Wood.

* Is the Constitution silent on the question of income tax for the very good reason that that tax did not exist at the time of **Federation**?

* The investigation into the complaints raised by the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots in respect of the operation of air services by South Australian and Territorial Air Services has been completed.

* At my direction, a detailed summary of the findings of that investigation was sent to the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots on 9 December 1976.

* The honourable member for Moreton then tried to draw another red herring across the trail by referring to the Institute of Public Affairs, the Teachers **Federation** and others not being able to spend money.

* I am delighted to say that the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**, the producer representative body throughout Australia, has endorsed the scheme.

* Retail prices have been rising at an average rate of 2.8 per cent a year since **federation**.

* He said that the committee of the Fairfield-Liverpool branch of the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** had decided to restrict the debate, listed for 5th October, to education in the electorate of Werriwa alone.

* I wish to bring a matter to the attention of the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  and the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  on behalf of one of my constituents and of the Australian **Federation** of Aquarium Fish Importers and Traders.

* 1 am informed that the **Federation** has the testimony of no less a person than Professor Emmens, head of the Department of 
Animal Physiology of the University of Sydney, that these fears are groundless.

* If this is so, I wish the Minister for Primary Industry would say so because my information is that the **Federation** has had a large number of sample of this water analysed by Professor Steinbeck of Sydney University and in his opinion these fears are also groundless.

* If the Minister were prepared to take 3, 4 or 5 weeks off to try to get agreement between the States, to get the necessary commitments from his friends in the Builders Labourers **Federation** and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, maybe he would get them to take the necessary voluntary action which  Mr Justice  Sweeney says they would need to take before effect could be given to these provisions.

* There are other telegrams from the Civil Service Association of Western Australia, the South Australian Public Service Association, the Victorian Public Service Association, the Public Service Association of New South Wales and the Australian Public Service **Federation**.

* Indeed, the way in which these proposals have come into the Parliament since **Federation**, I suppose- I cannot give the exact history but this has been the procedure for many years anyway- has been the form in which they are now.

* The first thing to be noted about this subject is that the lands in question have been under the custody of the Commonwealth at least since **Federation**.

* He said that the fact that since **Federation** there have been 7 or 8 years between each redistribution was a good enough reason for including the provisions for a 7 year periodin this clause.

* I think it is quite amazing that in all the time since **Federation** this Parliament has not been given the information which enables this kind of assessment to be made.

* Has the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations seen statements by the re-elected secretary of the Builders Labourers **Federation**,  Mr Gallagher,  that that union intends to pursue a program of guerilla warfare to gain additional payments for building workers?

* I received a table recently from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** and sought the leave of the honourable member for Hotham to have it incorporated in Hansard.

* Attached to the table that was sent to me was a letter from the **Federation** in which it asked that the table be publicised as much as possible to show just who is guilty in regard to pensions and just who made the pensioners a forgotten generation.

* For example, if in the conduct of a station the Government wants to consult the executive of the Builders Labourers **Federation** to establish some kind of connection between that body, its members and the television station, that would not necessarily be eliminated.

* In future the Whitlam Labor Government will be marked as the most realistic and progressive that this nation has had since **federation** because it has faced up to the realities of the times and has given overall benefits to the Australian people today and for generations to come.

* In February of this year, a time when they were in Government, the Minister for Education, in a letter to the Secretary of the Parents and Friends **Federation** of Victoria, stated: 

 Mr Speaker, section 3 of the Constitution provides that there shall be payable out of Consolidated Revenue for the salary of the Governor-General an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall be $20,000.

* It is proposed now in this Bill that, for the first time since **Federation**, the Parliament should establish an amount for the salary of the Governor-General other than that provided in the Constitution.

* Is the Treasurer aware that the Master Builders **Federation** is concerned at the difficulty of obtaining finance for homes already constructed or under construction and that the number of houses and flats commenced for the quarter ended March 1970 was lower than in the corresponding period in 1969?

* Now that the Miners **Federation** in the United Kingdom has destroyed the social compact there and the air pilots have done the same thing here and have both shown that the concept of a social compact is a farce against society, will the Minister, in all decency, ensure that the Government's proposal to urge the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to introduce indexation is reconsidered by the Government and an opportunity given to debate the concept in this House?

* A Riverina electorate has existed almost since **Federation**.

* My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Transport, relates to the continuing strike by Connair Pty Ltd pilots in which the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots appears to be playing a significant part.

* The Government is not a party to these matters, and the original concept of arbitration, according to the founding fathers of **Federation**, was to do 2 things - to settle disputes quickly and to fix wages.

* I should think that the last two years have been the most sterile for a Commonwealth government in the history of Australian **federation**.

* In turn, I know that  Mr Dunshea  was greatly influenced by an address he once heard delivered by the Federal Secretary of the Waterside Workers' **Federation**,  Mr Charlie  Fitzgibbon, on the subject of containerisation.

* Australian Steamship Owners **Federation**.

* On behalf of the Opposition I would like to welcome the initiative of the present Government in bringing together the many consumer groups throughout Australia which led to the formation of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations.

* It is true that  Mr Quinn  of the Victorian **Federation** of Co operative Housing Societies has made such  a  claim.

* All the efforts of travel industry organisations such as the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents and the International Air Transport Association to enforce their codes of ethics have so far proved ineffective in preventing agency failures.

* Mr C.  W. Freeland of the Department of Transport told the International Road **Federation** Australasian Road Conference last year that 61 per cent of our primary oil requirements went to transport in 1975.

* What is the **Federation** of Consumer Groups.

* The Australian **Federation** of Credit Union Leagues has recently renewed its request that savings with credit unions be acceptable for purposes of the home savings grant scheme.

* A representative of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations should be invited to attend meetings of the panel.

* In addition, idle time costs had to increase because employers, the previous Government through the Department of Labour and National Service and the ASIA had demanded recruitment to the industry, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, against the wishes of the Waterside Workers **Federation** and in spite of the fact that everybody foresaw redundancy situations in 1972 in both those ports and in ports such as Newcastle, Port Kembla, Brisbane and Adelaide.

* Since the employers and the previous Government insisted on recruiting men when the Waterside Workers **Federation** did not want to recruit and where the need was short term, they cannot complain because the **Federation** did not want compulsory redundancy.

* He is overlooking the fact that the whole situation has been brought about through the co-operation of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The personal income tax indexation provisions and the family allowances are the greatest social reforms since **Federation**.

* I might also say that the Australian wheat industry, through its **Federation** and the Australian Wheat Board, is at present examining in concert with the Minister for Primary Industry the matter of the re-negotiation of that wheat stabilisation scheme.

* It deals with the position of colonies and how they become States when they enter the **Federation**.

* So it is nonsense to suggest that as from 1 July, for the first time since **Federation**, public hospitals will charge pensioners.

* The Department of National Development is very important to the **Federation** and I believe its various components will become more important in the future.

* Mr Paterson  is the Managingdirector of Associated Steamships Pty Ltd, and at that time he was  Chairman  of the Australasian Steamship Owners **Federation**.

* The Opposition believes that as soon' as possible dicussions should be concluded between the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, the Ministers for Agriculture and this Government in order to introduce a long term stabilisation scheme which will have some meaning to the industry.

* But anyone who says that growers do not know whether they are going to be paid for over-quota wheat is not keeping informed of the situation, because the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation** has firmly laid down a policy for over-quota wheat - that there will be no payment for this wheat this year, but if wheat growers are able to include that wheat in their quota allocation for the forthcoming season there will be a payment on it.

* I am fortified in that by the statement issued by the teachers in the' Australian Capital Territory that local teachers and the Australian Teachers **Federation** should have been involved in more meaningful discussions on this Bill.

* That legislation had a most salutary effect on the Waterside Workers **Federation**, as indeed it was intended to have.

* The honourable member for Newcastle  (Mr Charles Jones)  referred in detail to a Press statement which I issued on 18th April 1972 concerning an agreement recently negotiated between the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and employers of waterside labour.

* The area between the 200 metre mark and the end of what is called compendiously the continental margin is to be handed over to a trusteeship arrangement operated by the United Nations and the coastal state - 'state' is used in that context in international law, not as a component of **federation** - for the purposes of international law.

* One of the grounds of his judgment was that on **Federation** the Australian States lost any international status which they may have had and the territorial sea became part of the Commonwealth area.

* In May 1970 violent and destructive raids were carried out by vigilantes from the Builders Labourers **Federation** in Sydney.

* In the 'Australia Left Review' of August 1970  Mr J.  Mundey, the **Federation**'s Secretary and member of the National Committee of the Australian Communist Party, is reported to have said: 
Another point I make concerns the Government's record on immigration.

* I am pleased that the New South Wales Government is sending teachers from the Australian Teachers **Federation** overseas on a grant.

* It shows that we have had inflation in Australia ever since **Federation**.

* I urge these things because, as I said a moment ago, I believe that, while I have some complaint about the fact that this new proposal has further delayed the plans of redevelopment of the Brisbane airport, at least it might be timely for the Government now, before planning reaches the stage of consideration by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works, to give attention to these problems and to other matters that have been raised by Captain Holt, an ex-president of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* It concerns the Builder's Labourers **Federation** and the Residents' Action Committee on the one hand and, on the other, substantially the State Government of New South Wales.

* The wake turbulence separation standards in RAC-2-37, which have been applied since 1976 were developed after consultation with the industry, including the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots (AFAP).

* I point out to the honourable member that the attack on tax avoidance taken by this Government since it came to office in 1975 is greater than that of any other government since **Federation**.

* As a Party which has been associated since **Federation** with all the humane policies that have been brought down in this Parliament, we will fight tooth and nail on every policy which relates to a lowering of living standards that the Government brings down in this Parliament.

* In a **federation** such as ours, which is designed to express the unity of the Australian people it is vital that we have a court system for the enforcement of State and Federal laws which is as unified as circumstances permit and not one that is divisive.

* In a **federation** a judicial system can be a cohesive force.

* It has been so since **Federation**.

* It is only by this means that the rule of law in our **Federation** can be fully realised in practice.

* The use of State courts was therefore seen by the founding fathers as a means of maintaining a simple court system within  the **Federation** with the High Court as the supreme court of Australia.

* I remind him that some rather strict controls have been laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Australian Association of National Advertisers and the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations in regard to the content of advertisements that are shown on television stations.

* In the face of this fact I defy the Food Industry Council of Australia or the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations to sustain the criticism of greed which they have levelled at the sugar industry.

* The dates of such meetings and the organisation involved apart from my own Department were: 13.2.74 Master Builders **Federation**, Housing Industry Association, Australian Timber Producers Council and The Treasury.

* 1.S.74 Master Builders **Federation**, Housing Industry Asssociation, Associated Chamber of Manufactures of Australia and The Treasury.

* 12.6.74 Master Builders **Federation**, Housing Industry Association, Associated Chamber of Manufactures of Australia and The Treasury.

* 15.8.74 Master Builders **Federation**, Housing Industry Association, Associated Chamber of Manufactures of Australia and The Treasury.

* 27.9.74 Master Builders **Federation**, Housing Industry Association, National Building and Construction Council, Building Workers Industrial Union and The Treasury.

* 27.1 1.74 Master Builders **Federation**, Housing Industry Association, Associated Chamber of Manufactures of Australia and The Treasury.

* Now the Waterside Workers **Federation** will probably seek payment for its members wrongfully stood down during this dispute and will seek a pledge that it will not happen again.

* Indeed, the practice of this Parliament since **federation** has been consistently to appoint men to such an office.

* Has the Teachers **Federation** now imposed a $14 increase to be so deducted, which will be used to assist the Opposition to conduct its general election campaign?

* The proposal for an oilseeds research scheme was initiated by the oilsee ds committee of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation**.

* With my recent announcement of Commonwealth assistance to the Australian Olympic **Federation**, the Government is keen to see the performances of our athletes upgraded.

* It is not easy, particularly in a **Federation** such as ours where we have State governments to consider as well, and it is particularly difficult in the initial stages.

* The Commonwealth Government has not seen fit to increase annual leave for its employees - and I can see the honourable member for Moreton anticipating what I am going to say - since **Federation** or in 72 years.

* More than at any time, I believe, since **Federation** Australia needs to re-examine and learn the lessons of the constitutional crisis of 1975 and to make sure that that dark day- 11 November- is never repeated in this country.

* Buka and Bougainville are being pushed towards complete secession -which is what they would probably vote for, union of the British Solomons which might be an intelligent settlement, or **federation**.

* I tell them that it will go on because this affair is the most rotten thing that has happened in this country since **Federation**.

* We have the table on which Queen Victoria signed the proclamation for our Constitution, and that set up this Parliament as the **federation** of the Australian colonies.

* The Bill provides, 1 think clearly enough for anyone who reads it carefully to understand, that it will have no application to internal waters as they existed at **federation**.

* I am advised that the Waterside Workers' **Federation** has drawn the attention of the Federal Advisory Committee on Waterfront Accident Prevention to the fact that waterside workers on occasions handle asbestos.

* **Federation** or since the electorates were formed, I can only reflect on the causes of the shattering events of 13 December.

* I believe that this is a sound extension of a principle which has been adopted since **Federation**.

* The Leader of the House is the only Minister since **federation** to have faced 2 motions of censure on his personal conduct.

* At this stageI should like to pay a tribute to the Sutherland District Parents and Citizens Association and the Sutherland Teachers **Federation** with whom I do not always see eye to eye.

* As this has been confirmed by spokesmen for the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents, will the Minister check to see whether a discount was given on package tours when the Australian Labor Party Government revalued?

* Incidentally, before deciding on projects is it proposed to consult with the Builders Labourers **Federation** and obtain its approval?

* The Liberal Party has the opportunity in this Parliament more than in any other parliament since **Federation** to get on top of the rump in the corner.

* As the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  suggested, this is to happen for the first time since **Federation**.

* The action of the New South Wales Premier and his Cabinet in deciding to appoint to the Senate a person belonging either to the Liberal Party or the Country Party as a result of the vacancy caused by the appointment of the Honourable Lionel Murphy to the High Court is something that flouts the convention which has grown up and has been applied almost universally since **Federation** and certainly has been applied universally since the adoption of proportional representation.

* As the current world price of wheat is in excess of $4 a bushel, will the Government reconsider the request of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to increase the first advance for wheat from $1.20 a bushel to $ 1 .80 a bushel?

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, representing the wheat industry, has requested that the maximum rate of tax specified in the Act be raised to 30c per tonne.

* While asking for the maximum rate to be raised the **Federation** has also sought an increase in the operative tax from the present 15c to 20c per tonne.

* On his definition of public interest not only the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the employers are involved in that agreement; many other people in Australia are involved.

* This is the first Opposition since **Federation** to be paid such a back-handed compliment by the media.

* Is it any wonder this announcement was acclaimed as the most far reaching social reform since **Federation**?

* Can the Postmaster-General state how the amount of funds provided to the Postmaster-General's Department by the Treasury since **federation**, namely $2,484,331,130 was arrived at?

* Historically, the Trans-Australian railway was one of the principal inducements for Western Australia to join the other Australian colonies in **Federation**.

* The whole thrust of this country since **Federation** has been to develop the capital of Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal water's as they existed at **federation**, the States have no such rights.

* It makes the same provision in respect of the internal waters of Australia, except as they existed at **federation**.

* In the case of a federal state, where for domestic purposes supreme legislative and executive power is divided between the **federation** and its component states or provinces, the question frequently arises whether the control of off-shore resources is exercisable, as a matter of internal constitutional law, by the **federation** itself, or by its component states or provinces, or is shared between both.

* In Canada by virtue of a special legislative provision, the question was referred to the Supreme Court, at the instance of the **Federation** itself in relation to the Province of British Columbia.

* Sovereign control over the mineral resources of both the territorial sea and the continental shelf was held to be vested in the **Federation** alone, to the exclusion of the component States or Provinces.

* In Canada, negotiations between the **Federation** and the Provinces are still in progress, but the Government of Canada has offered the provinces the administration of limited areas adjacent to the coast, and a share of the revenues from off-shore mineral exploitation in the areas federally administered.

* But I repeat that, alike in the United States and Canada, the Constitution was held to vest exclusive off-shore control in the **Federation**, as the Government asserts in the present Bill here; the concessions to the States and Provinces were not required by law but were made as the result of political decisions, the question of legal authority having already been answered in the **Federation**'s favour.

* 1 refer first to the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, which 1 have already mentioned and which was given shortly after the British North America Act the exclusive right to control the off-shore mineral resources of Canada, .outwards from the low-water mark, belonged to the **Federation**, to the total exclusion of the Provinces.

* Then a year ago, in an address to the Australian Conservation Foundation,  Sir Percy  Spender, Q.C., a distinguished former Commonwealth Minister and member of this House who later became  President  of the International Court of Justice, expressed the view that the off-shore rights of the Commonwealth under the Australian Constitution were as complete and as exclusive of the rights of the States as those established by the Supreme Court of Canada as belonging there to the **Federation**.

* the Queen's assertion of sovereignty in the territorial sea, recognised by international law, was not delegated to or conferred on the Australian colonies before **federation**.

* Firstly, in the formula customarily used where an Act is regarded as stating the law as it already exists, as well as possibly making new law, the Bill declares and enacts that the sovereignty in the territorial sea is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 5; similarly that the sovereign rights of Australia for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 10; and that sovereignty in the internal waters of Australia, with the important exception of waters that were internal waters of the States at the time of **federation**, and still remain such, is likewise vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clauses 9 and 11, which must be read together.

* This latter clause makes clear that the Act will not apply to waters that at **federation** were within the limits of a State and still remain within the limits of the State.

* These bays and harbours were within the limits of a State at **federation**, and remain so.

* Here, any interna] waters were within the limits of South Australia at the time of **federation** but passed to the Commonwealth when the Northern Territory was surrendered.

* But there are also off-shore waters which have become or may become internal waters of Australia by virtue of changes in international law since **federation**.

* At the time of **federation**, the general law was that the baseline of the territorial sea followed around the coast except where it encountered a bay whose width at the entrance was not more than 6 miles, that is, twice the then generally accepted breadth of the territorial sea.

* But I should note that any bays or waters declared in pursuance of clause 7 to be historic, as contrasted with bays that were already historic before **federation**, would come into the category of post-**federation** internal waters, to which clause 9 would apply.

* Is he able to say whether (a) in 1968, the Canadian Council on Animal Care was constituted as an independent body at the Federal level, financed by the National Research Council and the Medical Research Council, (b) the scientific community in Canada was totally in support of the establishment of this body, (c) 12 leading scientific organisations, including the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada and also the **Federation** of Humane Societies are represented on that Council, (d) the Canadian Council on Animal Care had, by 1972, assessed laboratory animal care and facilities in all universities, colleges and government departments in Canada, making recommendations for improvements where these seemed advisable, and that this work was subsequently extended to commercial firms at thenrequest, (e) members of local or regional humane societies are invited to join each assessment panel thus assuring these bodies, and through them the general public, that their valid interests are protected and (0 scientific papers submitted for publication in Canadian journals must state clearly that all work was performed in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guide.

* Whether that homeland is a separate entity, part of Jordan or joined in a **federation** with Jordan, is yet to be determined.

* This information has been supplied by the Commonwealth Steamship Owners **Federation**.

* The sort of people I would want to see on the board would be representatives of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* 282 (January/February 1977) and the Victorian Employers ' **Federation** report of 1 1 March 1977 (Vol.

* Having in mind the considerations which constrained the States, particularly the less populated States, to demand as the price of **federation** an Upper House with powers to exercise independent judgment in order to protect the interests of the States, it is inconceivable that those same States would agree to weaken the Senate by destroying its independence.

* The whole basis of the compact of **Federation** was to allow the States, no matter how small, to exercise their voice through the Senate where the size of the States makes no difference to the number of senators.

* The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority did not award 4 weeks annual leave at loaded rates for members of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* I see little that I can add to the comments I made on this subject in my address to the Australian Farmers ' **Federation** on 19 October 1977, and of which you are aware.

* I think it is the most distinguished and probably the most unusual group of members who have retired from this Parliament since **Federation**.

* As well as receiving representations from a large number of individuals, there have also been considered expressions of opinion from representative bodies including the National Farmers **Federation**, the Law Society of New South Wales, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Taxpayers Association of Australia and a number of other professional bodies.

* 1 stressed then that: 
In the early years after **Federation**, employees of the Commonwealth Public Service set a standard for the rest of Australia in conditions of employment.

* This Bill really represents the latest attempt by the Government to destroy the just and fair principles on which electoral distributions have been conducted since **federation**.

* The Leader of the Opposition talked about the 3 elections that had been held since the Vietnam war commenced, but he did not make the point that one of those 3 elections in which the Vietnamese policy was the vital issue, the 1966 election, saw this Government returned with the greatest strength that any Government has had during the 70 years history of **federation** in this country.

* -Has the Minister for Transport seen the reported statement of the Executive Vice-President of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots,  Mr Bruce  Crofts, that the closure of either the Devonport airport or the Wynyard airport by the Australian Government is inevitable?

* They are the gravest charges ever made against any member of this Parliament in the history of **Federation**.

* The whole tactic of the Leader of the Opposition has been to bypass this House, to undermine its established rights and authority- rights and authority which have never been challenged since **Federation** and would not be challenged in any other country with a comparable system of government.

* Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician,' plus supplementary assistance and .allowances in accordance with the Australian Council of Trade Unions policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* It was because of consistent policies that were implemented by successive Liberal-Country Party governments for 23 years; that has put the Northern Territory into a position where, in the not too distant future, it will be able to take its place in the **federation** of Australia.

* Provision for the making of by-laws has been a feature of the Austraiian Customs Tariff since **Federation**.

* As a consequence, representatives of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** and the Australian Wheat Board are currently examining and developing a concept that the Board might be authorised to adopt a dockage system with a view to discouraging the delivery of varieties undesirable in the market place.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** wants the advance increased.

* The previous Minister for Primary Industry, the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  rightly told the **Federation** leaders that just prior to the election it would not be right for him to commit a government in advance.

* The previous Minister said: 'My suggestion to you is that if we are returned I will meet the **Federation** straight after the election if I happen to be the Minister'.

* Do we accept that any laws, whether they be right or wrong, good or bad, may be flouted with impunity, the  President  of the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents,  Mr John  Webb said today.

* On 28 September the  President  of the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents sent me a telex expressing the **Federation**'s concern at the ACTU Leisure Club subsidy scheme which had been announced to the public on that day.

* From: Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents 
The Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents must express total disappointment at the failure of Government to intervene in the matter of the ACTU Leisure Club subsidy scheme announced today.

* On the same day, the  President  of AFTA sent a telex to  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the ACTU, expressing the **Federation**'s grave concern at the ACTU involvement in the subsidised travel arrangements.

* This is a fact clearly acknowledged and understood by the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents.

* involving the Miners **Federation**, which was then controlled by the Communist Party.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with Australian Council of Trade Unions 'policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with Australian Council of Trade Unions policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with Australian Council of Trade Union's policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* When I had discussions with him on Tuesday of last week the Minister was unaware of the public disquiet and of the controversy which had been aroused by a Press statement by a  Mr B.  Croft, the Executive Vice-President of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* The fact is that this Parliament is still working under much the same procedures in 1971 as it worked under in 1901, the time of **federation**.

* But I have been informed that it is on record in this Parliament that in 1972 **Federation** Insurance Ltd, a prominent insurance company, paid $30,546.04 to the Victorian branch of the Australian Country Party and that in 1973 the same company paid $47,000 to the Victorian branch of the Australian Country Party - 
The Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**, in submissions to the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and its Committee on Health Careers (Personnel and Training), sought unspecified funds in support of nurse education and training initiatives.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** wanted the right to appeal somewhere from the determinations of the Commissioner and it is appropriate and proper that there be the right of appeal.

* Back in 1965 the Department of Civil Aviation ignored the advice not only of the New South Wales airport development committee but also of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots which pointed out in that year that the proposed extension of the north-south runway to 8,500 feet was inadequate and also unsafe.

* The basic aims of the proposed plan, which has been accepted by the wheat industry organisation - the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** - and the State governments, are reflected in this Bill and the complementary Bills.

* I have been with an Australian parliamentary mission into the Parliament of the **Federation** of Canada and I have listened to a much bigger House than this going through all these criticisms and complaints.

* When it comes to putting the bl'ame on him, I say that this has always been thrown on the Minister by the Opposition whereas, in actual fact, all the suggestions regarding the quotas that we hear so much about were first made as recommendations by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* This was not by the Minister at all- 
Can the Minister for Labour and National Service indicate the current state of the Waterside Workers **Federation** proposal for a waterfront strike next weekend?

* put these claims to the Metal Trades Employers **Federation** with a request that all six be satisfied by direct negotiation.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* The employers want an open discussion aimed at the reform of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, according to  Mr Noakes, President  of the Australian Council of Employers **Federation**.

* Ours is the only Party that has been in existence since **Federation**.

* 1 ) When the Government provides money to community groups to purchase equipment such as in the case of the new hot-water system for the New South Wales Protestant **Federation** Children's Home, or office furniture for the New South Wales Good Neighbour Council Migrant Information Service, does this property, once purchased by these societies with Government funds, remain the property of the Government 
I reiterate that we are not now spending $100 to run a campaign in a marginal electorate.

* It has been said since **Federation** that perhaps the Labor Party does not have the ability to raise the same amount of funds as the Liberal and National Country Parties.

* Is he aware that the Australian **Federation** of Islamic Councils is deeply concerned by the decision and that it is regarded by some Muslims as an act of discrimination against the Islamic faith?

* The amount of the grant being made available by the Government to the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations is to remain virtually static at the sum of $85,000, which is particularly modest.

* It is the first time since **Federation** that a member of the Government parties has been returned in the seat of Leichhardt for a second term.

* In fact, between **Federation** and 1975 the Government parties held the seat for only 18 months, lt is a very large, complex and difficult electorate.

* 1 think it is time that State and Federal governments agreed to do something to take up the constitutional void which exists because of the changes which have taken place over more than 70 years since **Federation**, to ensure that one form of government or the other is able to and will legislate in fields such as price justification.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give  a  reasonably moderate pension.'

* However, it is a fact that every Labor Government that has held office since **Federation** has left behind its monument to its forward thinking.

* -Has the Prime Minister heard that the Waterside Workers **Federation** in the Northern Territory, which hitherto has given at least moral support to the Fretilin, has dissociated itself from the Fretilin Party because of reports coming out of Portuguese Timor?

* When the Labor Party nominated  Mr Arnell  the then  President  of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, his nomination was rejected by the Queensland Legislative Assembly.

* The Labor Party then nominated  Mr George 
This Bill really represents the latest attempt by the Government to destroy the just and fair principles on which electoral distributions have been conducted since **federation**.

* As well as the six State Education Departments, the Social Science Research Council, the Australian Teachers **Federation**, the Australian Council for Educational Research, and the National Council of Independent Schools were consulted in the formation of the Committee, which has a total membership of thirteen.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings for all Stales, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with ACTU policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* I ask the Minister for Education and Science: In the representations it made to him did the Australian Teachers **Federation** express opposition to the idea that this matter be subject to the approval of the Public Service Board?

* As regards  Mr Lancaster,  I have some views about the Teachers **Federation** but I do not think they are appropriate to mention to the House at the present time.

* The interesting point is that that is part of the original recommendation of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* Australia would be the only nation in the world to go to that conference with the units of its **federation** dithering on the point as to whether the States or the Commonwealth had sovereignty over these areas.

* Democracy is under a threat, our way of life is under threat, if we consistently turn our backs on precedents, conventions and traditions that have served us well since **Federation**.

* I announced publicly on 26th February 1970 that the Government had agreed to maintain the rate of first advance payment at $1.10 per bushel, less freight, for the next (1970/71) season on deliveries of wheat to the Australian Wheat Board within the State quotas, totalling 318 million bushels, as recommended by the Australian Wheat Growers' **Federation** and endorsed by each of the State Governments.

* In addition the Producer Consultative Group and the Exporter and Abbattoir Consultative Groups provided for in the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation Bill 1977 substitute for the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council for the purpose of recommending to the Corporation rates of levy payable under the Act.

* (a) and (b) An administrative subsidy to the Amateur Boxing Union for its National Senior Championships; A fares subsidy to the Australian Casting Association for the assembly of the Australian team for the World Casting Championships in Taree, New South Wales; Administrative subsidies to the Australian Volleyball **Federation** for various Championships; and a fares subsidy for attendance at an international conference.

* This unfortunate situation has arisen through the tactics of maritime unions, particularly the Waterside Workers' **Federation**, which has adopted a policy of stoppages and goslows on the waterfront at various times since the negotiations with the waterside workers new award broke down on 31 March when settlement by arbitration was refused.

* I refer now to a speech made the day before yesterday by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to the Australian Farmers **Federation** at the Hotel Canberra.

* It is again from the Prime Minister's speech to the Australian Farmers **Federation**.

* Having dealt with the fact that the Government had to remove the sales tax exemption on carbonated soft drinks containing more than 5 per cent of Australian fruit juice, the Prime Minister had this to' say: 
The Minister for Housing has taken a more serious and partisan attitude to building difficulties and strikes, which the Builders Labourers **Federation** claims are holding up $3,000m worth of building work and 40 projects in New South Wales.

* Early in that month there were headlines referring to 400 police guarding city work-in sites against striking members of the builders labourers **Federation**, and a number of people were arrested in that instance.

* That being so it is hard to give credence to the green bans motivation of the Builders Labourers **Federation** in all instances.

* A situation has been reached in which the State Labour Council - 'again according to the 'Sydney Morning Herald' - caused itself to be dissociated from the tactics employed by the Builders Labourers **Federation**, Surely that indicates a pretty extreme situation in relation to this one union.

* Not content with egging on the saboteurs of the Builders Labourers **Federation**, Federal Ministers now threaten penalties against building contractors whose crime is their refusal to bow to industrial anarchy .... To gain its ends, the BLF uses strongarm tactics, menaces and intimidation.

* The Builders Labourers **Federation** advised that it would be prepared to go back to work on a partial basis and on conditions which it determined.

* The **Federation** was prepared to work in certain places on conditions which it determined.

* But although all adult males were entitled to the vote in all States by 1900, female suffrage was accorded in only 2 States at the time of **federation**.

* Two other States, probably indicating their reactionary and conservative culture, did not introduce female suffrage until after **federation**.

* The honourable gentleman's question this morning has indicated that he believes it is for the arbitrary decision of the government alone, not for the decision of the wheat grower or the Australian Wheat **Federation**, as to what the level of production should be next year.

* In fact quotas were introduced by the Australian Wheat **Federation**.

* They were not dictated to the industry but were set by the Australian Wheat **Federation** which consists of representatives of wheat growers throughout Australia.

* It works through the establishment of wheat quotas applied after discussions and negotiations with the Australian Wheat **Federation** and the Australian Agricultural Council.

* and (3) I am informed that the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** at its Annual Conference early next month will be formulating proposals for a new stabilisation scheme to commence with the 1973-74 crop which, as has been the case with all previous wheat stabilisation arrangements dating back to 1948, will involve consideration by not only the Commonwealth but also all State Governments.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to a report prepared by the **Federation** of Australian Radio Broadcasters, that (a) 28 commercial radio stations are deemed to be controlled by newspaper companies, (b) 1 1 by television station licensees and (c) 22 by companies in a position to also control a television station licence; if so, is the position as stated in the report.

* I believe that that represents the largest number lodged for presentation at any one time since **federation**.

* I wonder whether it is not a sop to the Employers **Federation** that was represented outside the Parliament by the honourable member for Balaclava.

* Might I say that these disputes were contrived to pave the way for the local Builders Labourers **Federation** organiser to enter the big time in Victoria.

* One of the first Acts of **Federation** in 1 90 1 was an Act along these lines.

* But to see the parliamentary system that has been with us since **Federation** abused and dragged through the mud constantly and continuously brings contempt upon the House.

* The first question is: Why is it that the Labor Party has occupied the treasury bench for less than 17 years in the 72 years since **federation**?

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour would have their views.

* I am advised - I think it has been reported in the 'Australian Financial Review' - that the Minister had wanted ASIA to be the sole employer but that others, the Waterside Workers **Federation** and  Mr Fitzgibbon,  objected to that.

* I have no doubt that if that were done the Waterside Workers **Federation** would believe that the ASIA ought not be the sole employer and the sole disciplinarian.

* Some proposals have been put forward by the Waterside Workers **Federation** to the effect that preference ought to be given to friends and relatives of present members of the waterfront work force.

* I had hoped that the Waterside Workers **Federation** also would have wanted to achieve the same objective.

* I hope also that he will make available the information from  Mr Foster  and others that I understand is in his possession at the present time, so that we will all be able to turn our minds to a vexed and difficult problem that needs solution in the national interest and in the interests of not only Australian shippers, exporters and importers but also members of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* It is far from the Government's intention that this should open the way to government interference in the wheat-selling operations of the Board, but it will be obvious to honourable members, and it has in fact been clearly stated to the Wheat Growers **Federation**, that as the Australian Government assumes the financial responsibility of guaranteeing the plan from public revenue then, in the interests of the taxpayers generally - 
He said today the companies had gambled that duties would rise and had paid duty on goods they had in bonded store, so avoiding the Budget increase.

* 1 am concerned by the practice - which has happened almost every year since **Federation** - but I have been informed that the Commonwealth Government has no constitutional powers to stop it,'  Mr Chipp  said.

* He has referred to his conversation with the former general secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the late  Mr Healy.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Education aware that the ACT Teachers **Federation** called a stop work meeting today in the Australian Capital Territory government schools?

* Since the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was introduced in the early years of **Federation** industrial relations have been the subject of much argument and discussion throughout the nation.

* This exercise was perhaps the first time since **Federation** when a committee of any Parliament in Australia had had the opportunity, as it were, of starting from scratch and drawing up an outline of the form of self government for a part of the Australian Commonwealth.

* Coming to the Special Broadcasting Service, I quote from a letter I have received- no doubt all other members in the Committee have received it- from the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* The **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations last year said: 
-It is a fact that, in line with international practice, we have reduced the embargo on drinking by airline pilots from 12 hours to 8 hours.

* It is not a fact that this is not supported by the **Federation** of Air Pilots; it supports the reduction.

* But the **Federation** of Air Pilots, which speaks for the majority of pilots in this country, supports the reduction.

* He went on to say that  Mr Clark  expressed his appreciation to the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* In the light of his answer to an earlier question, does the Minister now agree that the action of the Waterside Workers **Federation** in preventing a sale of wheat to Chile was a stand-over tactic against one of Australia's trading partners and against Australia's long term trading interests?

* I realise that the Waterside Workers **Federation** had campaigned vigorously over a number of years for permanency for its members.

* The stage has been reached where it has been estimated conservativelythose estimates vary depending on whether one reads the report of the Waterside Workers **Federation** or of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority- that 1500 men are surplus to the industry.

* It is important to point the bone not only at the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the waterside workers.

* I was interested to read in today's  Australian Financial Review  the comments of the  President  of the Waterside Workers **Federation**,  Mr C.  H. Fitzgibbon, which were reported as follows: 
While the **federation** would hope that common sense and justice would prevail, we must prepare organisationally for the possibility that that will not be the position.

* As my colleague the honourable member for Denison said, the Waterside Workers **Federation** is planning a national strike which would have enormous connotations for the nation and its economy.

* It is a **federation**.

* Within the **Federation** are six States, one of which is the Republic of Croatia.

* One has only to look at the list that the Minister has agreed to have incorporated in Hansard to see the tremendous influence that the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia can have on the waterfront.

* The communists in the Waterside Workers **Federation** are exploiting their positions amongst the average decent waterside workers and manipulating them for their own base ends.

* This is a record number of semi-blueblooded members and senators since **Federation** - 8 altogether in the Parliament.

* He wants to restore the value of repatriation benefits despite the fact that this Budget provides the greatest repatriation benefits ever in the history of **federation** But what does the vague collection of the words 'restore repatriation benefits' mean?

* This particular project was helped by a grant from the British Trade Union Congress and the International **Federation** of Free Trade Unions.

* Has the Minister for Primary Industry received from the Australian Farmers **Federation** a request to the effect that the $10Om rural reconstruction proposals are insufficient and that it recommends the expending of $500m?

* TAA, AAA, EWA, Qantas, Australian Air Freight Forwarders Association, the Oil Companies, the Association of Commercial Flying Organisations, the Royal **Federation** of Aero Clubs of Australia, the State Planning Authority, the Departments of Health, Customs.

* asked the Prime Minister, upon notice:  (.1) Did he receive recently a telegram from the **Federation** of Netherlands Societies Limited indicating that the inadequacy of Australian social services is causing unrest among migrants and is one of the main reasons why so many migrants return to the country of their birth.

* Is  Mr I.  G. Lancaster, who authorised these, also an officer of the Teachers **Federation**?

* -In this House this morning we debated for a little while a matter of public importance- the attitude of the Government to the activities of the Aus.tralian Building Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers **Federation**.

* Hitherto the Waterside Workers **Federation** has agreed only to voluntary retirement but it is apparent to all that the rate of reduction in **Federation** members through this process will not achieve any dramatic reduction in numbers unless perhaps the retirement allowance for those who retire voluntarily is to be substantially increased.

* Having achieved permanency after long and bitter struggles, the union would be likely to react strongly to any attempt to dilute that concept without **Federation** agreement.

* The **Federation** was most reluctant to take on increased numbers of stevedores at that time as it could see that with the prospects of a decline in trade in the future there would be pressure on it to reduce the numbers again and thus the very concept of permanency would be threatened.

* It referred to representations made by the Australian Teachers **Federation** and the Australian Council of State School Organisations which argued strongly for the right to nominate representatives to the Commission.

* Has his attention been drawn to the complaint on this matter by the Master Builder's **Federation** of Australia in its Canberra Newsletter of February 1972.

* If so, did the **Federation** state that it has been pointed out forcibly to the Government that individual members of the organisation have been consistent and substantial supporters of the Government in its election campaigns in the past and that it would expect the Government to acknowledge that support and the role and significance of the industry in the general economy.

* I notice that the Minister in a speech to the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** a week or so ago mentioned this point.

* I think it is the Queensland Employers **Federation** who wrote to the Minister saying that if he could provide the information it would be interested because with all its efforts it had been unable to obtain the information necessary to make a study such as I suggested.

* The Tariff Board was established in 1921 and it has been an important and respected source of advice to 21 of the 28 Parliaments which have been elected since **federation**.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** survey this year indicated that 49 per cent of those students needing migrant or intensive English assistance were receiving no extra assistance.

* In fact, only yesterday I attended the Australian Road Transport **Federation**'s conference in Perth at which reference was made to the good work that has been done as a result of these grants.

* would be consistent with Australian Government policy since **federation** that the National Capital be developed on land acquired by the Australian Government.

* 3ZZ is an 'access' station operated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission; 3CR is a 'community' station operated by the Community Radio **Federation** Ltd. 
New South Wales Teachers' **Federation** Health SocietyA.

* No Prime Minister in the history of **federation** has had this experience.

* We heard the well worn theme- we heard it for 3 years- about centralist government and central control; the **Federation** does not exist.

* Has the Prime Minister seen reports that the Executive Director of the Victorian Employers **Federation**,  Mr Ian  Spicer, has called on governments at all levels to prepare economic impact statements to accompany every new statute or regulation, such statements requiring governments, their departmental officials and their instrumentalities to show clearly the costs of any new action they wish to undertake, with that action and its cost being justified to the community?

* The fundamental problem on the waterfront is the sweetheart agreement between the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour.

* In the face of these threats the AEWL has not been prepared to make an application for a declaration of redundancy except after some agreement with the **Federation**.

* For its part, the **Federation** has been successful in limiting retrenchments to those men willing to accept the redundancy benefits payable under the agreement 
The one solution I keep coming back to is to put all waterside workers, whether they be clerks or members of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, under the control of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to get some control and discipline in the industry, so that we will not have the problem of locked-up labour and of people being paid for sitting at home doing nothing when other employers are short of labour.

* We note that even in the last annual report of the Commonwealth Teaching Service the Commissioner drew attention to the fact that he has relationships and negotiations with the Australian Capital Territory Commonwealth Teachers **Federation** and the Northern Territory Commonwealth Teachers **Federation**.

* Is it a fact that negotiations between the Australian **Federation** of Air .

* Has his attention been drawn to the priorities adopted without dissent by the third conference of the South-East Asia and Oceania Region of the International Planned Parenthood **Federation**, and the messages of support from the Prime Ministers of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.

* Is it a fact that the annual leave entitlement of' Commonwealth employees has not " been increased since **Federation**.

* Can he say what was the annual leave entitlement for' employees of the New South Wales Government at the time of **Federation** and what it is now.. 
Can be say what was the annual leave entitlement for daily paid employees of the South Australian Government at the time of **Federation** and what it is now.

* Primary industries are directly represented by  Mr D.  P. Eckersley, OBE,  President  of the National Farmers' **Federation** and  Mr F.  A. L. Connell, AM,  President  of the Australian Fishing Industry Council.

* There we have the 2 most populous States in our **federation** and the most isolated State in our **federation**, which have a major responsibility for roads and a major need for road maintenance and construction, all echoing the comments of each other.

* These constitutional provisions were the basis of the tenure of the judiciary in the Australian colonies before **Federation**; that is, judges held office during good behaviour and could be removed by the Crown for misbehaviour without an address from Parliament, subject to appeal to the Privy Council.

* This question was before the High Court in, I think, 1918 in a case between the Waterside Workers **Federation** and Fitzpatrick.

* -Has the attention of the Minister for Transport been drawn to a claim by executive officers of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots that pilots of Trans-Austalia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia receive salaries ranging from between $7,000 to $21,000 per annum?

* It is only recently that this problem of demarcation has come into existence as a result of division between the Waterside Workers' **Federation** and the Transport Workers' Union in Darwin.

* The only effect of it so far as these barge operations are concerned is to open up old wounds- wounds that exist in the Darwin port between the Transport Workers' Union on the one hand and the Waterside Workers' **Federation** on the other.

* Is the Minister aware that the Australian **Federation** of Local Government Associations has made up its mind as to what it wants in the way of financial assistance and has asked that 5 per cent of income tax collections be made available to local government?

* Also when we regained office, the Labor Cabinet had even refused to consider over several months a request by the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** to introduce an underwriting scheme to stop the bottom falling out of the manufacturing sector of the dairy industry because of the collapse in the world price for skim milk powder.

* By March 1976 we had acceded to the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** request, to which Labor refused to accede, and introduced underwriting at 50c per lb.

* I want to give some credit to the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** which in the last couple of months, when it saw that an impasse had been reached in the situation, supported the selective underwriting proposal put up by the Minister as an alternative proposition when the national aggregate scheme had seemed to flounder because of State intransigence.

* What the Minister has put before us with this legislation is actually a simplified or less restrictive version of the selected underwriting which the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** supports.

* The **Federation** support of this proposal has, I believe, made it easier to go forward or perhaps has made it more palatable.

* I want to remind everybody that the figure of 96,000 tonnes was recommended by the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**.

* Is the Treasurer aware that the Master Builders' **Federation** is concerned at the difficulty of obtaining finance for homes already constructed or under construction and that the number of houses and flats commenced for the quarter ended March 1970 was lower than in the corresponding period in 1969?

* Many of the problems which have arisen in the past 70 years could not have been foreseen at the time of **Federation**.

* In the question that 1 put to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  this afternoon, I asked specifically had he had any communication from the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* That report states at page 24: 
As the honourable member will be aware, 3EA is an 'ethnic' broadcasting station operated at present under the control of my Department; 3ZZ is an 'access' station operated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission; 3CR is a 'community' station operated by the Community Radio **Federation** Ltd. 
Further to Question No.

* 1425  (Hansard,  30 November 1976, page 301 1), what were the results of the investigations into complaints he received from the Aus.tralian **Federation** of Air Pilots in respect of the operation of air services by South Australian and Territorial Air Services.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to an item in the  Daily Commercial News  of 31 May 1979 entitled 'Support for Ipec', if so, is it a fact, as stated by the  President  of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, that the operation of DC3 aircraft was not in the best interests of efficiency and safety.

* Of course they do not, for the simple reason that our constitutional fathers made lt practically impossible to change the system that they established and they could never have achieved **federation** unless that system came about.

* Not since the days between **Federation** and the First World War has an Australian Government in time of peace, established a coherent, intelligent or intelligible defence policy.

* Since **Federation** the forms, practices and patterns of the Parliament have been built around and founded on the acknowledged and constitutionally prescribed fact that in regard to financial matters the House of Representatives is predominant over the Senate.

* With the deferment of Supply by the conservative senators late last year we saw the destruction of the system that had developed in the first three-quarters of a century of our development as a **federation**.

* Mr Speaker,  I have seen Press reports of statements made by executive officers of the Pilots **Federation** that its members only receive between $7,000 and $21,000 a year.

* The question whether income tax deductions would be allowable to members of the Employers' **Federation** for the cost of arbitration proceedings rests with the Commissioner of Taxation who is responsible for the Administration of the taxing laws.

* I believe that the credit union movement is very pleased and I would like to quote  Mr Dermot  Ryan, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian **Federation** of Credit Union Leagues, who was reported in the August 1972 edition of the 'Credit Union Quest', when speaking of credit unions, as&lt; follows: 
Has his attention been drawn to a letter dated 30th August 1971 forwarded to all members of the Commonwealth Parliament by the **Federation** of Catholic Parents and Friends' Associations, Sydney, in which the Government is criticised for its alleged failure to honour its promises to the Catholic educational system.

* The National **Federation** of Pensioners said that it did not expect pensioners to get an increase in this Budget.

* Copies of the report have been sent to national and State sporting associations, individuals prominent in sport, tertiary institutions and professional bodies such as the Australian Sports Medicine **Federation**.

* As regards the statement by  Mr Crofts  of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, I can understand his attitude because of the criticism by  Mr Cameron  and me of the recent astronomical increases that were granted to pilots so that they are now really, to use Clyde's expression, in the ' fat cat ' category.

* Since **federation**, since we became a Commonwealth, we have had only 8 redistributions in 76 years.

* 1970, that he attributes industrial unrest in the stevedoring industry to Communist factions in the **Federation** who, in an endeavour to improve their position, are engaged in a competition in militancy.

* Has he information that the Federal Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation**,  Mr C.  H. Fitzgibbon, is a non-Communist and has his attention been drawn to  Mr Fitzgibbon's  description of his statement as utterly incorrect.

* Its self-satisfaction has the same sort of crazy logic as was displayed by  Mr Gallagher  of the Builders Labourers **Federation** when he claimed that forcing a major construction company into bankruptcy, thus putting thousands of members of his union out of work, was a great victory for the workers.

* The imposition by the Government of the highest and most onerous interest rates since **Federation**.

* Assistance has been allocated as follows: $418 to the Amateur Boxing Union of Australia to assist with the administration of its national Senior Championships $508.50 to the Australian Casting Association to assist with the assembly costs of the Australian team for the World Casting Championships in Taree, New South Wales $4,354 to the Australian Volleyball **Federation** to assist with the administration of national championships; and to assist with the fares for a delegate to attend an international conference.

* I think that, at the outset, I should place on record the considered opinion of the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** on the stabilisation plan.

* The **Federation** considers stabilisation a very necessary support plan to replace devaluation assistance.

* The **Federation** considers, however, that the stabilisation plan has its weaknesses.

* The **Federation** points out that it will need to continue as planned and the amount of support may have to be increased to compensate for costs that are increasing and which are beyond the control of growers.

* The Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** has referred to the stabilisation plan envisaged in the present legislation as a support scheme to replace devaluation.

* It is the vehicle by which we intend to demonstrate to the Australian people that we believe power exercised by the Labor Party in office in the Federal Parliament has gone to an extreme which calls upon us, for the first time since **Federation**, to take measures in the upper House of the Parliament to ensure that these Bills are not passed.

* Recreation  (Mr Stewart)  has had considerable discussions with the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents.

* He told the **Federation** of Economic Organisations that protectionism was a greater threat to world trade now than at any time in the last 30 years.

* Has his attention also been drawn to comments by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** in the same article where oil companies were criticised on the grounds that they were exploiting a captive market by raising distillate prices at rates not justified by the overall lift in crude oil prices.

* It is appropriate in this debate while we are dealing with these estimates to emphasise and reiterate that the Budget brought down in August by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  contained the greatest personal taxation reform in the lifetime of **Federation**.

* For instance, Sydney is trying to get the 1988 Olympic Games but one of the rules of the International Olympic **Federation** is that all events must be held in the one city and because of Australia's quarantine laws that appears impossible.

* Has  Mr Quinn,  Victorian  President  of the **Federation** of Co-operative Housing Societies, claimed that Victoria will build 1,500 fewer houses under the proposed Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement because finance to co-operative building societies will be cut from 30 per cent to 20 per cent of Commonwealth .advances?

* Works of art have come to the National Collection in a number of ways, for example, as purchases, gifts and bequests, and the period over which these works have been acquired extends back almost as far as **Federation**.

* a fact that the Australian National Line had negotiated an industrial agreement with the Waterside Workers **Federation** concerning work at roll-on, roll-off shipping terminals in which the parties had agreed to what virtually amounted to a 35-hour week.

* This is the man who weeps tears of blood for people in the country yet he has opposed every rural organisation ... the Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, the Australian Meat Board, the Australian Wool Commission and all the other woolgrower and farmer organisations.

* Did the National Council of the Australian Road **Federation** and the State regional committees recommend that the Commonwealth Government should accept full financial responsibility for the construction, maintenance and continued up-grading of a system of prime necessity national roads.

* In relation to the proposed, re-siting of Brisbane Airport, has consideration been given to the criticism by the ex-President of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, Captain Holt, to the positioning of the main runways, and his suggestion that they should be slightly re-aligned.

* A request did come from the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** for permission to make a film involving infants' classes in one or more Canberra schools and also involving  Mr Hawke  walking through the schools at the same time.

* I am surprised also that the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** decided that neither the shadow Minister for Education nor the Leader of the Opposition was the appropriate person to walk through the classrooms at the time the filming was taking place but instead wanted  Mr Hawke,  who really has no direct responsibility in education matters.

* If the Teachers **Federation** wants to make a film of a classroom out of school hours after the end of the school day, that can be done.

* If there are parents who wish to have their children in a film at that time after the end of the school day no doubt they will be able to make appropriate arrangements with the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* As a result of agreement recently reached between the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers' **Federation**, employees in the stevedoring industry will receive 4 weeks annual leave which I am informed was on the basis that they can be required to work 3 shifts per day, 7 days a week.

* One of Australia's largest farmer organisations, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, has condemned the present tactics of the Commission and has recommended that the Government should act as quickly as possible to acquire the entire wool clip.

* The Minister for Primary Industry has obtained views on the referendum from the Australian Agricultural Council, the Australian Wool Industry Conference, the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation**.

* The National Collection was begun soon after **Federation** but it was not until recent times that information was kept about the public display of works of art from the Collection.

* Under what exceptional circumstances were  Mr Alfred  Urbanski, representative of the Polish Government in Exile, and  Mr Tibor  Tollas, representative of the World **Federation** of Hungarian Freedom Fighters, granted visas to visit Australia in 1977.

* Therefore, the statement by the  president  of the **Federation** of Automotive Product Manufacturers last Thursday is all the more welcome.

* Obviously, when the Australian Farmers **Federation** in solemn conference rejects them and rejects their point of view and the newspapers of the nation have such headlines as Country Party is Fooling Fanners' and Farmers Rebuff the Country Party', they are embarrassed because what they have been saying over the last few months to the people in the cities is that the countryside is still in the state of recession it was in when the Government changed.

* Of course, he probably achieved more in real terms for the trade union movement in Australia during his occupancy of that most important portfolio than any previous Minister had achieved in the history of Australia since **federation**.

* A typical example of the need for such a college is the recent utterance of  Mr Norm  Gallagher of the Builders Labourers **Federation** who, when asked on 30 May during an Australian Broadcasting Commission news program how he saw his reelection to leadership of the union, said: 
We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earn.ings for ali States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with Australian Council of Trade Unions policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* The exception, I think, is the Waterside Workers **Federation** which has an election day to elect its officials in the same way as the people of Australia elect their governments.

* Can the Minister for Labour and National Service inform the House of the outcome of stop work meetings by several branches of the Waterside Workers **Federation** yesterday?

* and (2) A telegram was received from a gentleman, signing himself as  Chairman,  apparently reporting the views on Australian social services of members al a general meeting of the **Federation** of Netherlands Societies in New South Wale.

* On Sth December 1962, on the application of the Wool and Basil Workers' **Federation** of Australia, an order was made that a vote of members of the New South Wales Branch of that organisation who were then on strike be taken as to a return to work.

* Does the Government intend to fulfill the commitment by the previous Government to grant $250,000 to the Australian Olympic **Federation** towards the expenses of sending an Australian team to the Olympic Games in Canada later this year.

* It might be worthwhile to refer to the fact that the ordinances and regulations with which the Bill before this chamber tonight is dealing date back right through the days of Labor administration, right through the days of Liberal-Country Party administration to the very early days of the **Federation**.

* This document is the sub-' mission of the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** of Tasmania and it answers questions that were raised by the  Hon.

* The Minister asked: 
The answer given by the **Federation** was: 
The second question that was raised was related to the constitutionality of such a scheme.

* The Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** was asked: 
A committee on which the Master Builders' **Federation** of Australia is represented is preparing a report to the Government on the levels of plant usage in the building and construction industry and the possible increases in efficiency that might be brought about by the use of additional plant.

* Firstly, why is it that a rule that has been observed since **Federation**, that is, giving the widest information that is practicable, with the exception of the total amount to be borrowed and the interest rate which are negotiated by the Treasurer when he is on the spot, is not being observed?

* Australia-wide-Mr Brian Wyllie, Chairperson, Lone Parent **Federation** of Australia c/o ACOSS, P.O.

* The consolidation of the three states under the wing of Vietnam looks like the fulfilment of Ho Chi Minh 's dream of a communist Indo-China **federation**, especially in view of the American withdrawal.

* The  President  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** has called for tax cuts and a selective increase in government expenditure.

* It is for this reason that I have the understandable duty to move, on behalf of the Labor Opposition, the following amendment: 
A Voluntary Code of Cigarette Advertising, the main aim of which was to 'prevent cigarette advertising being directed towards young people', was introduced by the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations on 1st January 1966.

* The text of the Code, which resulted from discussions between the then Minister for Health, the **Federation** and the cigarette manufacturing industry is as follows: 
Today's debate also reflects, once again, the Federal Labor Party's complete commitment to the centralisation of financial and economic power in Canberra.

* During the next 3 years we will be introducing the most significant reform to Australia's system of government since **Federation**.

* what section of the Act contains such a provision, and, on how many occasions since **Federation** has an employer been prosecuted and penalised for refusing to employ labour at allegedly uneconomic rales fixed by the Arbitration Commission.

* If one has a look at the terms of reference one will discover that the Waterside Workers **Federation** is a corporate body.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** - egged on by the Country Party - refused to allow inspectors on to properties to inspect stored wheat on the farm.

* The honourable member for Eden-Monaro made great play about the satisfaction of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** with this plan.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  made it very clear that the **Federation** accepted the plan rather reluctantly.

* This again is the suggestion of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* Why did he not praise the **Federation** on that point, too ?

* I do not disagree with this, but let it not be said that quotas are gone for all time- despite today's announcement that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** has decided against quotas and has removed them for the time being.

* I appreciate the desire of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to get a plan, and its accepting therefore something very much against its principles.

* Therefore may I suggest that for the sake of good relations within the **federation** and for ease of administration Part III be limited to the Northern Territory.

* The honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  has handed to me a copy of a letter that he has received from the **Federation** of Netherlands Societies in New South Wales.

* The letter reads: 
The members of the **Federation** of Netherlands Societies in New South Wales in General Meeting noted with much regret the unrest amongst migrants and Australians alike caused by the absence of an adequate system of social services in Australia.

* The **Federation** has further noted that an estimated one million people in Australia are living below Kie poverty line.

* -Can the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations advise the House of the current state of the disputes involving bans on building projects in Victoria imposed by the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation**?

* That is equivalent to arguing that  Mr Polites  from the Employers' **Federation** ought to be treated as presenting views on behalf of the Liberal Party.

* Does he believe it to be in the national interest for the common market established in Australia at **Federation** to be Balkanised in this way?

* Upon such an application, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the conduct of the **Federation** (whether in respect of its continued breach or non-observance of any award or any order by the authority in force under the Stevedoring Industry Act1956-1965 or its continued failure to ensure that its members comply with and observe such an award or order or in any respect), or the conduct of a substantial number of the members of the **Federation** (whether in respect of their continued breach or non-observance of such an award or order .

* Where the Commission has made a declaration under section16 of this Act, the Governor-General may, within six months after the declaration was made, by Proclamation, declare that this section applies in relation to the **Federation**.

* the registration of the **Federation** under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act ... is thereupon, by force of this section, cancelled.

* The Executive Bureau of the  WFTU  - that is, the World **Federation** of Trade Unions; a Communist front with which the Australian Council of Trade Unions is not in communion - met in Khartoum from 24th to 26th February, lt published an Appeal to the Trade Unions and Workers of the World' to make 8th May a 'day of action for world peace'.

* The date would of course have been decided long before the **Federation** met in session.

* The 2 federal wool grower organisations - the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation** - resolved to press for such a body as did the national body  of the wool growers, the Australian Wool Industry Conference.

* There was on 20th May, or the day before, a meeting of the Victorian Employers **Federation**, the' Australian Bankers Association, the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, the Council of Fire and Accident Underwriters of Australia, the

* In submissions to and discussions with the Committee, the Australian Teachers **Federation** and the Australian Council of State School Organisations argued strongly for the right to nominate representatives as members of the Commission.

* The Committee- 
It is a national disgrace that 77 years after **Federation** so little has been done to establish a comprehensive national railway service.

* 178 last September the Australian Dairy Farmers' **Federation** and the Australian Dairy Industry Council have considered the matter further.

* Is it a fact that Qantas and the **Federation** of Airline Pilots cannot reach agreement on conditions applicable in the industry, particularly when the jumbo jets begin to operate?

* As you remarked,  Mr Speaker,  42 years is an incredible time of service, particularly in the history of Australian **Federation**, transcending as it does more than half of that history and going back to the origins of this place.

* They have not been introduced just because of the Latrobe Valley dispute, the Seamen's Union dispute, the dispute involving the transport people in Western Australia or the dispute involving the Builders Labourers **Federation** in Melbourne, although I believe that each one of those disputes provides justification for the introduction of these amendments.

* The present situation represents one of the biggest political crises that this House has seen since **Federation**.

* The Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** approached the Interim Committee of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission in November 1973 for finance for a Nursing Research and Education Foundation.

* The Governor-General has appointed Miss Mary Patten, a Secretary of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**, as a part-time Commissioner  or  the Hospitals and Health Services Commission.

* Meanwhile, the acting director of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures,  Mr C.  F. Sullivan, and the acting secretary of the Victorian Employers **Federation**,  Mr L.  J. Lockie, both accused the Government of failing to take proper action against the inflation spiral.

* The Treasurer rose in this place on Tuesday night to tell the world he was introducing antiinflationary measures  by  bringing down the most severe impost in postal and telegraph charges that this country has seen since **federation**.

* The first thing it has done this session is to propose the largest postal imposts since **Federation**.

* All the earlier statements of 
1 ) Has the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents now voiced strong criticism of the Travel Agents Bill which was passed by the House of Representatives on 28 October 1975.

* I point out to the Minister, as he would well know today, that it is not only the Associated Chambers of Manufactures which is annoyed at the haste with which this Bill is being presented but also the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations, the representative body of the consumers of Australia, the body which the Minister's own Government sponsored last year, the body which the Minister's own Government provided with funds amounting to $70,000 to present the consumers' point of view.

* The Minister knows that he has received a letter from the  Chairman  of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations.

* In that letter the  Chairman, Mr Malone,  expressed his disappointment that the **Federation** did not have the opportunity to view a draft of the legislation and expressed his disappointment that the Bill has been presented for second reading discussion with such haste.

* I think it is also necessary in fairness to a balanced presentation of  Mr Malone  's letter to point out that he made it clear that the **Federation** fully supports the intentions of the Government.

* Following the meeting the Minister announced that, principally as a result of representations from the Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation**, the Aus.tralian Government Insurance Corporation Bill would be amended to make the Australian Insurance Corporation subject specifically to the Life Insurance Act 1945-1973 and the Insurance Act 1973.

* The Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** and other relevant bodies are co-operating in this process.

* These matters have been the subject of discussion between myself and such organisations as the Master Builders **Federation**, the Housing Industry Association and the Chamber of Manufactures.

* That was the result of the dispute between the New South Wales branch of the Transport Workers Union and the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia over who should handle large containers.

* In the history of the Australian **Federation** no Party has had such a remarkably clean record in government and in Opposition as have the Liberal and National Country Parties.

* 1 ) What are the details of the amounts which make up the total of $488m in outlays on rural assistance in the 1 974-75 Budget, as mentioned by him in his speech to the Australian Farmers' **Federation** in Canberra on 29 October 1974.

* Of course, there is the classic story of how he provided the Wollongong Cup for Jim Healy, the Communist Party member and leader of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, whom he used to assail.

* Frequent discussions between officers of my Department and the Treasury and representatives of the Master Builders' **Federation** of Australia, the Housing Industry Association and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia; 
Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the report dated September 1971 of the Committee of Inquiry into Nursing commissioned by the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**, Queensland Branch.

* My Department also is having discussions with the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters with respect to new approaches to research in the relevant areas.

* **Federation**.

* Negotiations on the new scheme were conducted by the Minister for Agriculture,  Senator Wriedt,  with the executive of the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation**.

* When the negotiations were concluded successfully with the **Federation** on 8 March, the  President  of the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation**,  Mr Max  Ridd, stated publicly that he was satisfied with the results of the negotiations.

* In common with the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**'s proposals submitted to the Government last September, the major objective of the scheme is to give the wheat industry some security against price fluctuations without distorting the underlying trend in market prices and to keep the cost to the Australian pubhe within definite limits.

* The proposals from the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** have been accepted in this new and unique scheme which moderates the impact of fluctuating prices on the international market.

* The honourable member for Isaacs appears to be defying you as he is continuing with a denigration of Norm Gallagher of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* Mr Gallagher  only last week said that there was one shopping complex which was not commenced for 18 months because the developers would not pay the $21 a week a worker that was part of the blackmailing tactics of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* Ari indication of the Builders Labourers **Federation** attitude to the whole matter is the fact that, while this blackmail is going on, it has a log of claims before the Commission for improvements in award conditions.

* The League and the **Federation** is investigating the feasibility and advisability of establishing a credit union bank.

* Is it a fact that release to the news media was delayed so that it would become public only a short time before the Annual Conference of the Australian Whcatgrowers **Federation**; if not, what was the reason for any delay. 
)

* Has the Minister received any requests from primary producer organisations for assistance to attend meetings of the International **Federation** of Agricultural Producers in Jamaica in October 1975.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with ACTU policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* Did he receive representations from the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** in February 1978 requesting a reduction 1 per cent in interest; if so, what action has been taken on the representations.

* In relation to the owneroperators allowance, I think the honourable member would be aware that the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  has advised the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** that he is prepared to have the matter re-examined next year in time for a decision to be taken as to whether the matter might be adjusted for the commencement of the 1975-76 season.

* The **Federation** is apparently content with that undertaking.

* The Senate is now more a House of review than ever it has been since **Federation**.

* Is it intended to accede to the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**'s request to grant, over three years, $3m as a fund for nurses obtaining tertiary qualifications, and to enhance nursing education programs.

* I should like the House to join with me in congratulating all those who had a hand in this success, particularly the players led by their captain Peter Wilson, the coach, Rale Rasic, the manager, John Barclay and the  President  of the Australian Soccer **Federation**, 
1 ) to (3) The projects referred to (new hot water system for the New South Wales Protestant **Federation** 's Childrens 
Has the Minister received representations from the Australian **Federation** of Child Care Associations regarding massive vacancies in child care centres in Australia.

* I understand that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is to receive representations today from the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* In my own State of Western Australia the Friends of East Timor organisation operates from the office of the left wing Millers and Mill Employees **Federation** in the Trades Hall.

* Requests have been received, both from the **Federation** itself and from other interested bodies, for an Australian contribution to the **Federation**.

* Representations on this matter have been made by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to the Minister for Primary Industry, who has referred them to me.

* If so, was this the reason for the refusal by the translation unit to translate a communique issued by the ACT Teachers' **Federation** regarding staffing in ACT schools.

* I understand the Australian **Federation** of Aquarium Fish Importers and Traders, has placed a submission before the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that the Australian Road Transport **Federation** held its 1979 annual conference in Hong Kong.

* This has been recognised as the single most important reform in the Australian welfare system since **Federation**.

* The number of letters and other communications I have received show that not only individuals but also sporting organisations and major national organisations such as the Olympic **Federation** and the Confederation of Australian Sport have welcomed the program I have been speaking about and have congratulated the Government on its initiative in introducing it.

* The **Federation** was also represented on the Committee of Inquiry into Nurse Education and Training.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with ACTU policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* There has been a lot of comment in the industry, particularly from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the cattlemen's union group, about the extent of ministerial power under this legislation.

* Smits was sponsored by the Latvian **Federation** of Australia and New Zealand; that  Mr Vaghin  was sponsored by the Russian Orthodox Brotherhood of Australia; and that Professor Voronel was sponsored by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.

* The cult operates here under some corporate names such as the Unification Church, the Universal Church of the Holy Spirit, One World Enterprise Pty Ltd, the **Federation** for World Peace and Unification Ltd and Freedom Leadership Foundation Ltd.

* The date of release to the news media was not in any way influenced by the date of the annual general conference of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* I ask for the indulgence of the House to clarify a matter in which I believe, on all the information available to me, I have misrepresented the position of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* That this House supports the application of the City of Melbourne to the International Olympic **Federation** for the 1988 Olympic Games to be held in that city.

* It is true that this issue was the only reason why Western Australia came into the **Federation**.

* The need for that base has been in the minds of the defence establishment almost since **Federation** and it has taken 78 years and two World Wars to get this naval base.

* At the London offices of the International Planned Parenthood **Federation** - which, as I have already mentioned, is supported by the Government - I was shown minute springloaded clips which hold out for women who might otherwise have had to undergo surgical sterilisation, the option of a reliable, readily reversible occlusion of the fallopian tubes.

* No other government since **Federation** has come within a bull's roar of this record.

* The Government wm receive a record amount of money drained from the taxpayers in one financial year since **Federation**.

* It is most significant to look at what has happened since **federation**.

* Section 87 provided that the customs and excise duties, which were virtually the only taxes available in the early days of **federation** would be distributed on the basis that three-quarters of this amount would go to the States and the remaining one-quarter would go to the Commonwealth.

* Does the honourable gentleman recall receiving a letter sent to him on 13 February by the representative of the Cyprian community of Melbourne and Victoria, the Pan Hellenic Committee for the Relief and Independence of Cyprus and the **Federation** of Cyprian Communities of Australia, seeking an appointment with him either in Melbourne or in Canberra in order to discuss the invitation to Archbishop Makarios?

* I ask him whether he remembers replying on 8 March to that representative in these terms: 
What are the details of the new superannuation claim by the Australian **Federation** of Airline Pilots and what would such a claim cost the airlines annually.

* The tragedy is that we have had to wait for 75 years of **Federation** for firm, constructive and conclusive action to be taken on this matter to end all Australian court appeals to London.

* Whilst perhaps it was arguable at the time of **Federation** that an Australian superior court could not recruit within Australia men of sufficiently high learning and experience to deal with the more complex cases coming before the court, subsequent events proved that, far from being incapable of providing judges of the highest calibre, Australia has had the good fortune to produce jurists who have shown themselves as world leaders in their field.

* As far as appeals are concerned, if the States support these still, the onus is surely on them to rebut what Alfred Deakin said at **Federation**, and I conclude by quoting Deakin 's remarks that the conservative classes, the legal profession and all people of wealth' desire to retain appeals to the Privy Council.

* When I was Minister for Labour I told the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots that these pilots were being overpaid.

* A balance is struck from the employers' point of view by also including the Master Builders' **Federation** of Australia on the Council.

* How many (a) senators and (b) members of the House of Representatives have served in the Australian Parliament since **Federation**.

* To provide support (chiefly through clerical assistance) to encourage the formation of an Australian **federation** of consumer organisations; 
The Victorian Employers **Federation** yesterday called for a public inquiry into the operation of the Australian Telecommunications Commission.

* The criteria which have existed since **Federation** and which have been accepted by all governments in the interests of truly representative government are to be changed.

* At **Federation**, approximately two-thirds of the representatives in this Parliament came from country electorates.

* However, that is a convention which has prevailed through the 75 years of this **Federation** and it has been brought under threat only by the present Opposition.

* Has the New South Wales **Federation** of Parents and Citizens Associations applied for the concession; if so.

* **Federation** that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one-half of the number of States.

* For the first time in our history since **Federation** the Australian people have been given the opportunity to make their views known on matters relating to Australia's immigration and population policies 
The attitude of the Government to the activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* Al tentative Radio Association Community Radio **Federation** Inner City Radio 
It is necessary for me to remind the House that we are discussing the Social Services Bill (No.

* I hold in my hand a letter dated 30th March 1972 from the **Federation** of Netherlands Societies Ltd to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon).

* It is a long letter in which the **Federation** refers to the inadequacy of social services and says: 
I am not sure but 1 will give the Minister a list of the countries that do have portable pensions without the trappings, the hang-ups and the inhibiting prohibitions imposed by this Government.

* I have referred to the **Federation** of Netherlands Societies Ltd of which there are many branches around Australia.

* There was no reply to the **Federation**'s letter to the Prime Minister.

* When I inquired by way of question placed on the parliamentary notice paper as to the reason, the Prime Minister said that neither he nor the department of Immigration had the address of the **Federation** of Netherlands Societies Ltd. Every honourable member on this side of the House, by virtue of the intensive contact he has had with that **Federation** and other migrant groups, would know not only the secretary's address but also the address of some members of the **Federation**.

* Whilst the loyalty by the pilots to a member of the **Federation** is admirable, the **Federation** must recognise how necessary it is to preserve the integrity of the safety procedures that have given Australia the best safety record in the world.

* But this was caused by the demands made by the Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers **Federation** who tied up the ships in port.

* The older and more recognised and reputable organisations, such as the Australian Farmers **Federation**, the Australian National Cattlemen's 
The present Act has been law since **Federation**.

* That situation is clear from a statement issued by the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** which referred to the Government's position in the last Budget in these terms: 
That is not the Federal Opposition parties in this Parliament speaking; that was a direct quotation from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation**.

* I asked the Minister whether his Department would, between the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill and consideration of it in Committee, give the matter serious consideration with a view to taking up with the Australian Teachers **Federation**, if the criteria are acceptable, whether they could be, as they are in South Australia, incorporated by instruction.

* This is a natural by-product of the population surge to the cities that has taken place since **Federation**- a surge which, incidentally, has many obvious undesirable aspects.

* Workers **Federation** of Australia which has been going on now for six or seven weeks.

* As  Mrs Irene  Ellis, Secretary of the Australian Pensioners **Federation** commented: 
... and now is supported apparently by the fellow from the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The indemnity payments admitted to have been made to the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Is it intended to appoint a nominee of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** to: 
Works of art intended for exhibition in the National Gallery have been acquired over a very long time beginning soon after **Federation**.

* And further, clauses  10  and  14,  taken together, make it clear that sovereignty over the internal waters of Australia (including their airspace, bed and subsoil) is also vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, with the  exeption,  however, of those waters which were internal waters of a State at the time of **Federation** and which still remain within the limits of the State.

* National Health **Federation** of Australia (unspecified) 
Was the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** consulted; if not, why not.

* This is an area which has been occupied by the States ever since **Federation** and which, by the force of the arguments of the honourable member for Grayndler, is a very fundamental to the commercial life of Australia.

* At **Federation**, the citizens of the Northern Territory, as residents of the State of South Australia, enjoyed the same political rights as other Commonwealth citizens.

* Two members of the 'think tank' team, both dairy farmers, have been appointed to the Australian Dairy Corporation from a list of names submitted by the Australian Dairy Farmers ' **Federation**.

* I mean since **federation** - 
The message from the Senate on the Bills which appropriate the moneys for the ordinary annual services of government is a direct challenge by the Senate to the authority of the House of Representatives.

* These rights have never before been questioned by any action of the Senate since **Federation**.

* I hope that the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  will look at this proposition in association with the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and the Australian Wheat Board.

* In addition, material has been circulated by the Australian Teachers **Federation**, the Council of State School Organisations, the Australian Union of Students, the Federal Catholic Education Office, the University Staff Association, and so on.

* At about the middle of this year, the Australian Teachers **Federation** produced material in which it cast some doubt on the effects that have been attained.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** carried out a national survey and produced a sheet which compares the configuration and the facts.

* Then the comment of the **Federation** is this: 
How many permanent Commonwealth public servants since **Federation** have been dismissed for (a) lying or misleading a Minister, or causing a Minister to mislead the Parliament, (b) incompetence, (c) publicly criticising government policy, (d) taking bribes of any kind from persons or bodies benefiting from their administrative decisions and (e) breach of the laws or conventions relating to secrecy.

* You may wish to emphasise to the **Federation**- 
That is the **Federation** of Tasmanian Chambers of Commerce- that the arrangements sought by the Commonwealth relate only to the imposition of road transport charges in respect of bulk items.

* I believe that the provision of this money is good because I recall, as the National  President  of the **Federation** of Australian Karate Organisations, attending the world championships of karate in Japan 3 years ago.

* It was the primary cause of its shattering defeat last year- the greatest thrashing since **Federation**.

* Did the editors of Butterworth's Fourth Edition of 'Federal Industrial Laws' at page 380 slate that  Mr Justice  Dunphy exhibited some rather dubious reasoning when he ruled in the case of Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia that an organisation, party to a batt, is concerned in that ban at every moment of time that the ban continues.

* There have been protracted discussions between officers of the respective State departments of primary industry and agriculture, my own Department, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* In other federations where this same question of the authority of the central government or the provincial or State governments over off-shore areas has been an issue, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act has been held up as a hallmark of cooperation within a **federation** instead of a persistent confrontation between the 2 forms of government, which can lead only to divisiveness, a slackening of exploration and outrage by the provincial or State governments at the attempted takeover by the central government particularly because of the financial ramifications of such a takeover.

* In much the same way, some of the eastern provinces of Canada, because of the historic lateness of their entry into the **Federation** of Canada, have asserted their right to have exclusive control over the off-shore areas.

* That litigation is still going on in those 2 great federations, whereas in Australia some six or seven years ago we found a solution to that confrontation between governments in the one **federation**.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* We may well find ourselves in the Pacific still arguing the merits of the Constitution when the whole world has changed or when Great Britain itself has probably entered a **federation** of Europe and is part and parcel of a federal system with a complete new concept.

* Both the employers, as represented by the National Industrial Council, and the Waterside Workers **Federation**, have expressed a very strong desire to achieve a normal industrial relationship, that is, one where employees are identified as employees of a particular company which is responsible for meeting their award entitlements.

* In the Waterside Workers **Federation** there is particular resentment at the disciplinary role that the ASIA has played in the past.

* This proposal was vigorously opposed by both the National Industrial Council representing stevedoring companies generally and the Waterside Workers **Federation** because both wanted a normal industrial relationship.

* Even the Australian Taxpayers' **Federation** is asking when this Government will keep the promises made by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that he was going to cut out the tax rip-off.

* I understand that the 1971-72 Annual Report of the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations contains statements along the lines suggested by the honourable member.

* In my view this would be the largest amount appropriated for education in any Budget since **Federation**.

* I point out that this has been a request by the Apple and Pear Growers' **Federation** of Tasmania, which represents 75 per cent of the growers in that State.

* The changed circumstances of the House since **federation** have made a reduction in tha quorum necessary and reasonable.

* Those people who belong to another union such as the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia or the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union- the people who work in the canteens at these works- will be entitled to receive the unemployment benefit.

* This is the greatest threat to democracy since the foundation of this **federation**.

* It is true that in the first half century of **federation** governments always included such Ministers.

* Each one of those people in his turn proposed the secession of his particular State from the **Federation**.

* I believe in the **federation**.

* I will deal with representations which have been submitted by the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, the Australian Road **Federation** and the Municipal Association of Victoria.

* The Australian Road **Federation** bases its objection on one basic premise which is shared by the other 2 bodies, and that is its belief that the new Bureau 'cannot perform its essential role as a minor part of a major government department '.

* The South Australian **Federation** of Chambers of Commerce recognises the importance of the Eyre Highway as a link.

* The **Federation** believes that there would be an increase in capital inflow of about 300 per cent in that period, lt believes that the industries of South Australia would benefit a great deal if the South Australian Government were to seal the Eyre Highway.

* My fear is that Australia is heading for the day when it has, in effect, a unitary government operating within a warped and inappropriate- or no longer appropriate- framework of a **federation**.

* What I doubt is the wisdom of developing a situation in which a **federation** is controlled by its national government where that control is through the purse strings.

* The article referred to the refutation by the spokesman for the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots of the statements of the Director-General of Civil Aviation.

* Surely this would have been a reasonable action in view of reported statements by **Federation** spokesmen that the airline wanted a further test conducted on the T-VASI system before allowing their 747 pilots to use it for landings, particularly when the visual approach slope indicator system, the system employing red and white guide lights, is known and accepted as being unsuitable for jumbo jets.

* Wannon to understand the working of the levy system which led to his quite erroneous and unworthy accusation that a deal had been done between the AEWL, the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the parties to the Stevedoring Industry Council.

* The honourable member for Wannon tabled in Parliament on 28th March a letter to  Mr Murray  Byrne from the Executive Director of the AEWL,  Mr Craig,  in which  Mr Craig  said that at a Stevedoring Industry Council meeting on Friday, 16th March, 'an arrangement whereby some casual out-ports were subsidising others was rejected entirely by the parties to the discussions, including the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the ACTU on the grounds that it was improper for some small ports which may well have problems of their own to be forced to carry additional costs to maintain another port or ports'.

* This equipment was recommended by the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots: the recommendation was supported by officers of the Department's Victoria/Tasmania Regional Office.

* After 71 years of **federation** and millions of words in support of decentralisation, Australia now is the most urbanised country on earth.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* No government since **Federation** has revealed in such a short time so many unpleasant characteristics lacking in any constructive or redeeming contributions to the life of this nation as this Fraser Government.

* I think that by the exercise of force the Government has reached the point where the best thing it can hope for in the future is a **federation**, with local government or provincial government in some of these areas exercising power over land as a means of defending the areas against Port Moresby.

* The Conference concluded that there was an urgent need to create greater awareness among international trade union organisations (in particular the International Transport Workers **Federation**) and among trade union officials in the region, of the real problems and circumstances of the island communities in order to obtain their cooperation in working towards fair and reasonable conditions for those employed in the maritime services which will be consistent with the economic and social position of the peoples of the region'.

* I think that anybody who does what has been used in the illustration is entitled to be condemned not only by all members of both sides of the Parliament but by every citizen in this country, because that person has set out to destroy a relationship that has been built up since **Federation**.

* As honourable members will know, in the preparation of this Bill there was discussion with the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* The first 2 penalties under clause 35 - sub-clauses (a) and (b) - were inserted specifically at the suggestion of the **Federation**.

* The Labor Party will win this election because of the known qualities of its team and its policies, because it has men better prepared for office than any who have sought to gain office at any election since **federation**, and because our policies are the best prepared and most thoroughly scrutinised ever presented by any party at any election since **federation**.

* The question is not one of transferring to the Commonwealth specific powers consciously left with the States under the Constitution, but of allocating between the Commonwealth and the States the power necessary to fulfil a responsibility of government which did not exist when the Constitution was originally framed but which, in the Committee's view, is now generally accepted in the light of developments since **Federation** .

* However, information made available to my Department by the Meat and Allied Trades **Federation** in relation to strikes at Victorian abattoirs and meat firms during 1975 and 1976 is contained in Table One.

* No doubt when the Federal bodies meet - I am thinking of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and on the other side the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** - they will make some recommendations.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers' **Federation** and ADIC suggested that before introducing legislation for payment for milk through State Departments of Agriculture, it would be advisable to introduce a trial period at testing for fat and protein in individual bulk milk supplies to factories and in herd production recording schemes for individual cows.

* It is the most stupid deal ever undertaken by a federal government in the history of **Federation**.

* I understand that an industry conference held in Canberra some two weeks ago by the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** strongly favoured the continuation of selective underwriting.

* During the Budget deliberations the Government on 2 occasions had prolonged discussions with the Australian Farmers **Federation**, the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, the bodies that substantially represent the major producing sectors throughout Australia.

* Discussions have taken place at Agricultural Council level and with the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and me on the details of these new proposals, which largely arose from the Industries Assistance Commission report which was handed down late last year.

* At the moment there are two areas outstanding in the attitude of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** representatives and me.

* Ever since **Federation** federal Government spending has built up gradually but then in one year it increased by 46 per cent.

* In May 1970 there was a violent and destructive raid by vigilantes from the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* The nation was the same size at the time of **federation** in 1901, and it has not changed materially since then.

* This situation became very obvious to the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation**, which is the supreme body of wheat growers in Australia.

* Facing up to the enormous problems, which were almost impossible to resolve, the **Federation** decided on a quota proposal, which needed the backing of the Commonwealth for financing the first advance and which needed the support of all State governments for implementation.

* Members of the Liberal and National Country Parties ought to remember their boast that they have controlled government in this chamber for two-thirds of the time since **federation**.

* We now reach a situation in 1976, after a Liberal-Country Party Administration for two-thirds of the time since **federation**, in which a major industry, one of national importance, is to close.

* In addition, some concern has been expressed within the community that the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the **Federation** of Australian Radio Broadcasters believe that in many ways the ABC should not compete with the commercial stations.

* It passed the following resolution with regard to the fundamental principles of Australian broadcasting: 
The Opposition - or some parts of it - is as out of step on this measure as it was on the Industries Assistance Commission measure, which was opposed by a section of the Opposition despite the fact that the Australian Farmers **Federation** did not oppose it.

* Since the initial debate on the measure the **Federation** has made useful suggestions which, it has said, make it a totally attractive and acceptable measure to the primary producers of Australia.

* By continuous strikes, the Government has been challenged by  Mr C.  H. Fitzgibbon and  Mr Docker  of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia to indicate who is running this country.

* 96/1 19 of 29 September 1976,  Mr C.  H. Fitzgibbon, a self-acknowledged communist, stated that the **Federation** would recommend a national stoppage of unlimited duration - 
12) (a) ( 13) (a) and ( 14) (a) It is intended that assistance be provided to the organisation or organisations most able to assist the Prices Justification Tribunal in considering the consumer interest in inquiries.

* The views of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations on the standing of a particular consumer interest group wouldbe relevant when an application for assistance is considered.

* Need I remind the House that not so very long ago a consent agreement between the waterside employers and the Waterside Workers **Federation** was duly filed in the court and the Government chose to intervene and appeal.

* We pointed out earlier in this debate that the disparity between the various States in representation in the Senate in accordance with the number of people in the States, all States having equal numbers of senators although they have great differences in population, arose from a federal compact and we paid this price as the price of **federation**, lt is not something which we should otherwise willingly have paid but the compact has been made.

* This was the day on which the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  was having his row with the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* On that day the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots said that it would not carry a Labor Minister by aeroplane in Australia and it certainly would not carry any Ministers out of Canberra.

* There is no doubt whatsoever that the recent agreement entered into between the employers of waterside labour and the Waterside Workers **Federation** is an agreement which has no regard to the public interest.

* Therefore, when the honourable member for Balaclava expresses concern at the impact which this agreement, if ratified by the Waterside Workers **Federation**, will have on costs throughout the general community, I respond most vigorously by saying that that sense of concern is very much shared by this Government.

* I suppose this is the only way in which our **federation** will advance.

* I pointed out that these guidelines had been operative since **Federation** and were laid down long before **Federation**.

* The whole purpose of this section, as one will see if one reads the Constitutional Convention debates of the 1890s, was that as a territory assumed new responsibilities and a new status it entered the **Federation** on a different basis.

* The basis of its entering the **Federation** was to be that it had something approaching the responsibilities of a State.

* One could take the 
We ' therefore call upon the Commonwealth -Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent: of the average weekly male ' earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with the Australian Council of Trade Unions policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* Even the watchdog of the industry, the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents, which has about 560 members of whom 230 are in New South Wales alone, has been unable to police the industry mainly because there is no compulsion for anyone calling himself a travel agent to belong to the AFTA.

* It is also strengthening its ties with its international parent, the Universal **Federation** of Travel Agents Association, for several hundred young people already in the Australian travel industry to take a 3-months correspondence course covering the whole complex structure of international travel.

* The Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents favours a Federal government system of licensing travel agents, because its officials fear that anomalies in legislation by the separate States could create loopholes enabling unethical agents to continue to operate.

* Mr Russell  of the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents in a letter in the  Australian Financial Review  on 25 February this year said: 
What the honourable member for Wannon did was make a speech which contained 2 fundamental errors.

* He rationalised his claim by saying that the Builders Labourers **Federation** had agreed only to a conditional and partial resumption of work.

* Nobody is talking about the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* The Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** has published a study of the profession covering the years 1960 to 1967.

* The State quotas for wheat for the 1969-70 harvest were proposed by the industry itself through the Australian Wheat Growers' **Federation**.

* I can well understand that, because some years earlier I happened to attend a Teachers **Federation** conference in New South Wales when  Sir Charles  Cutler became the new State Minister for Education.

* The Askin Government went so far as to seek the deregistration of the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* Consequently the New South Wales Government failed in its dedicated task of clipping the wings of that **Federation**.

* What was the **Federation** interested in?

* Ultimately when they were compelled to strike on one or two days in order to show their determination to do the best by the children for whom they were responsible, the Askin Government moved to seek the deregistration of the **Federation**.

* But he will not give members of the **Federation**, or any public servants, access to any such tribunal to determine working conditions.

* Mr Muskens  of the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents claimed that safety standards could be jeopardised if cut price air fares were introduced.

* Mr Krumbeck  of the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents has referred to the confusion over fare schedules being announced before they are actually approved by government.

* I ask the Minister for Education and Science whether he has had a request from the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** for permission to make a political film in one or more Canberra schools.

* It gave the average Australian citizen protection which he had been missing since **Federation** in the fields covered by the present Act.

* The Austraiian Wheatgrowers **Federation** which represents growers in the wheat industry has requested that under this amendment the maximum rate of tax be raised to 30c per tonne and  that the  appropriation of the Commonwealth matching contribution be included in the Wheat Research Act.

* It should be noted that at the present time the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** is looking at 20c.

* The various State Labor councils and the Australian Public Service **Federation** have asked Federal and State Governments to bring in price control for all goods.

* They were imposed because a request was made by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** for a restriction on production due to the heavy oversupply of wheat in the granaries in Australia as well as in other countries.

* This week the Government Members Education Committee met a delegation from the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* People are deluded,' the  president  of the Australian Farmers' **Federation**,  Mr W.  N. Hogan, said.

* I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations whether, with the Prime Minister and other Ministers, he was involved last night in discussions with representatives of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** concerning the proposed retrenchments at Chrysler Australia Ltd works scheduled to occur over the next 18 months as part of that company's rationalisation program, directed towards ensuring its long-term viability?

* Miss M. Patten, S.R.N., B.A., Federal Secretary, Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**.

* The Master Builders **Federation** of Australia in today's  Bulletin  also has commended the Federal Government The working man of Australia who knows that this country needs the old fashioned stability that we had for so many years also knows on which side his bread is buttered.

* I challenge any honourable member opposite to walk out of this chamber tonight and ring Laurie Short of the Federated Ironworkers Association, Norm Gallagher of the Builders ' Labourers **Federation**, Pat Clancy from the Building Workers Industrial Union or any of the secretaries of the unions which have been deregistered and ask him what deregistering a union proves.

* Nor can it be held that the then Minister for Primary Industry, the right honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  or the Wheatgrowers **Federation** was being obstructive.

* I believe that that is the correct course to take in a **federation**.

* The provision which has existed since **Federation** for country electorates to have a slightly smaller enrolment than city electorates is as valid today as it was when our founding fathers wrote it into our laws 72 years ago.

* It was in furtherance of these discussions that three officials from the Soviet Olympic Games Organising Committee visited Australia in early October at the invitation of the Australian Olympic **Federation**.

* Further discussions are to be held next month when a representative from the Australian Olympic **Federation** is to visit Moscow along with representatives of Jetset Tours, the designated sales agency in Australia for Moscow Olympic Games package tours.

* The second aspect which should be borne in mind is that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** placed a condition on this program, which made it extremely difficult to initiate.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** was not prepared to give the inspectors that opportunity.

* Several attempts were made over the first 25 years of **Federation** to establish such a body but each attempt foundered.

* I had discussions, I think on last Monday week, with the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** of Tasmania.

* I told the **Federation** that recognising the fact that these difficulties existed, the Government would still look to the industry in particular to try to introduce some of the marked changes, in particular those relating to the delivery and handling of fruit for export, which seemed to have given to producers, for example, in New Zealand and South Africa marked advantages over Australian fruit growers.

* Mr Hamer  went on to say that Australia needed to know what action its Federal Government intended to take to uphold conciliation and arbitration - a vital institution since **Federation**.

* It is most significant that the people who nave expressed concern at this situation are responsible members and offices of the Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia.

* Honourable members will recall that, since the earliest days of **Federation**, Assistant Ministers, Honorary Ministers or Ministers without Portfolio have been a recurring feature of ministerial arrangements.

* The Minister then goes on to give an example of the Nurses **Federation**.

* It does not matter whether they are groups from trade unions associated with the total industry, from the Commercial Telecasters **Federation** or from the.

* Commercial Broadcasters **Federation**, there are regular conferences between the Board and these people, each putting to the other their point of view in relation to particular matters.

* I understand that enticement is being put out to the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia to join in this transport complex.

* Would it be those who support or at least do not condemn crippling strikes which come quickly on the scene such as, perhaps, we have seen in the New South Wales Branch of the Builders Labourers **Federation**, which not only stop production but destroy that which has already been produced?

* This concept probably would not have been beyond the ken of the great legal giants at the time of **Federation**- men like Edmund Barton and Deakin and others.

* But it does appear that originally it was the view of the fathers of the Australian **Federation**, the people who set up the Constitution of Australia, that this type of law ought to be the responsibility of the States.

* I ask the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to a report that several members of the Hospital and Health Services Commission, including the head of the School of Health Administration at the University of New South Wales, the medical superintendent of Melbourne's Alfred Hospital and the federal secretary of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**, will not be reappointed to the Commission when their terms of office expire?

* I also agreed to the sum of $ 1.5m being made available from the Fund and to be held in Trust by the Australian Dairy Farmers' **Federation** so that the **Federation** can provide the Secretariat and research facilities for the recently established Australian Dairy Industry Conference on an on-going basis.

* I might say for the information of the House that, notwithstanding earlier comments to the contrary by the **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufacturers, the  President  of that group,  Mr Norman  Jackson, announced on Sunday that the automotive components industry would give its qualified support to the GMH complementation plan as now specified by the Federal Government.

* The closure of either the Devonport or Wynyard airport by the Australian Government was predicted as inevitable by the executive vice-president of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots  (Mr Bruce Croft)  yesterday.

* However, most Institutes have Royal Charters dating back prior to **Federation**, and it is thought that the States may have supported the Institutes in the earlier stage.

* It happens to be a part of the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** and when giving evidence before the Rydge Committee which was considering a- short time ago a possible education commission in New South Wales, the **Federation** said: 
Never since **Federation** has Australia needed to be represented abroad by a head of government so much as now and never has Australia been represented better than it is at present.

* Never since **Federation** has Australia needed more co-operation and understanding in international affairs than we need at present.

* This is a remarkable record and it has not been equalled by any Prime Minister since **Federation**.

* At the centre of much of this trouble has been the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* A few years ago this union demonstrated its irresponsibility and its real aims to such an extent that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decided to deregister the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* I think the problem that has been raised by the Australian Teachers **Federation** is in fact that a statutory authority is proposed.

* Alternatively, will this be the position: The representatives of the Australian Teachers **Federation** will go direct to the Public Service Board, rather than have discussions with the Commissioner, in the full knowledge that the Board is an instrument of Government power and policy?

* By so doing he was not bound, under the Act, to employ Waterside Workers **Federation** personnel.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** considered that employees would lose their work.

* If the Waterside Workers **Federation** takes over from the Transport Workers Union a major demarcation dispute will occur in relation to small ship operations in the Northern Territory.

* The men who are manning these ships will not work under the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Indeed in 1896 the British Government in an order in council adopted a new line but it was not put into legislative form because **federation** took place here.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that the Australian Amateur Fencing **Federation** is to conduct the 1979 world fencing championships in Melbourne from 18 to 28 August 1979.

* Will the Government give immediate and favourable consideration to increasing the grant already promised to the Australian Amateur Fencing **Federation** for the staging of the 1 979 world fencing championships.

* Will up to$4m be made available now specifically to assist the Brisbane City Council bus services as the Minister promised and as he was reported by Alderman Jones to have promised at a meeting of the South Queensland Roads **Federation** in Brisbane on Friday, 26 April 1974?

* A voluntary code  of  Cigarette Advertising, the main aim of which  was  to 'prevent cigarette advertising being directed  towards  young people', was introduced  bythe  **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations on 1 January 1966.

* The Code resulted from discussions between the then Minister for Health, the **Federation** and the cigarette manufacturing industry.

* When pilots of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots employed by Qantas went on strike from 24th November 1966 to 22nd December 1966, was a claim for compensation made under the Seat Pool Agreement between Qantas, BOAC, Air India, Air New Zealand and MalaysiaSingapore Airlines.

* Due to a ban by the Waterside Workers **Federation** imposed in 1974 on exports to Chile, cargo cannot be marked or manifested through for Chile.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and maritime unions have imposed these bans in protest against the political complexion of the Chilean Government and its policies.

* When the executive director of the Life Offices' Association of Australia,  Mr Renton,  to whom I have already referred, told the 'Australian Financial Review' on 28 April that the Australian Government insurance office would require expert staff who could be found only from the existing industry where there is a shortage of experienced and qualified people, the Australian Insurance Staff **Federation** pointed out that general insurance companies had retrenched over 430 staff in the last 6 months alone, most being experienced staff with long service.

* I have stressed previously the magnitude of what was involved- that in 1972-73 the total of government spending was $ 10,000m and it had built up to that level gradually from **Federation** over a period of 72 years.

* Even more graphically, in 1974-75 the level of spending increased by 46 per centand increase of nearly 50 per cent in one year on the level which, I repeat, had gradually been built up over 74 years since **Federation**.

* During the year the **Federation** made further approaches to the Federal Government seeking recognition of the credit union as an approved savings institution for homes savings grant purposes.

* This is a diabolical scheme and has never been done by a worthy Treasurer of this country since **Federation**.

* Exactly 20 months from the date of this Government's election to office with the greatest majority any government has had since **Federation** its reputation is finally in tatters.

* I cannot understand why  Senator Wriedt  did not accept the logical and forceful argument of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to increase the first advance payment to $1.80 per bushel.

* It is true that within States and between States there are significant differences in the profitability of dairy farms, the volume of production, in seasonal opportunities and in markets, but what we have tried to do in offering the selective underwriting arrangements is to consult with State governments and State Ministers to ensure that they are fully cognisant of the arrangements, as also are the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and the bodies responsible for overseas promotion and regulation and the Australian Dairy Corporation.

* I first forecast this world wide downturn in the economies of these countries in October of last year at a dinner given by the Employers **Federation** at the Hotel Canberra.

* -Can the Minister for Transport indicate to the House the present position in regard to the dispute between Connair Pty Ltd and the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots which has resulted in a ban on airline services to Alice Springs and a crippling of that town by the denial of services?

* What has been the effect of the ban imposed by the **Federation** on the operation of Connair?

* This includes the grant of $250,000 to the Australian Olympic **Federation** towards the expenses of sending Australia 's teams to the winter and summer Olympic Games in 1 976.

* The Prime Minister endorsed this level of Commonwealth Government commitment when he launched the Australian Olympic **Federation**'s fund raising campaign on 26 January 1976.

* Discussions were held with the Technical Teachers Association, the Victorian Teachers Union and the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* The day before yesterday at a conference of the Australian Farmers **Federation** in Canberra the Prime Minister, in referring to the dairy bounty, said: 
That is the conference of the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation**- strongly supports the industry authorities in their approach to the Federal Government seeking stabilisation scheme support of 80c per bushel on up to 7,500,000 bushels shipped at risk it is of the opinion that the stabilisation support price should be adjusted if necessary, to a figure in excess of 80c and sufficient to provide a coverage of additional costs including any increased overseas freight charges.

* But if the Nurses **Federation**, with a membership of less than 5,000, decided to amalgamate with the AMWU, I would think that the Registrar would say to the AMWU, if it sought to be exempt from the provisions of the Act requiring that a plebiscite of members be held: The work that nurses do is so dissimilar from the work that boiler makers and other members of the AMWU usually perform that it would seem to me incongruous that your members should have to accept an association with nurses except by a decision of the members at a plebiscite.'

* Apart from the obvious need for the Australian States to establish a Federal government responsible for defence, external affairs, immigration and other matters, in which Commonwealth influence is becoming progressively greater, I believe that few problems could have influenced the founders of **federation** more than the hotchpotch of railway systems of that time, with various gauges in various States.

* Let me quote what the Miners' **Federation** and  Mr Justice  Gallagher went on to say.

* The report states: 
In the case taken in April 1963 by the Miners' **Federation** against Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui over living and other conditions at Moura, the Coal Industry Tribunal (Judge Gallagher) paid a warm tribute to the miners' women folk there.

* That this is the case is certainly due to the fact that the Waterside Workers **Federation** has consistently broken agreement after agreement.

* So that in being on this occasion very critical of the Waterside Workers **Federation** 1 do not want the House to be under any misapprehension that there is not at the same time great criticism to be made in relation to the employer organisations.

* The 2 federal wool grower organisations - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** - resolved to press for such a body, as did the national body of the wool growers, the Australian Wool Industry Conference.

* Just recently, referring to the period when the Australian Labor Party was in office, the federal director of the **Federation** of Australian Radio Broadcasters said: 
What honourable gentlemen who have suggested such things do not understand is that during the 23 years of government of the Liberal-Country Party coalition and almost since **Federation** and the existence of industrial legislation in Australia, one of the principal objects of that legislation, both State and Federal, has been the encouragement of the formation of representative bodies of employees and employers, and their registration pursuant to the provisions of those acts.

* port **Federation** (Goods Division).

* port **Federation** (Passenger Division).

* -The member was reading a report of mine which talked about how Pat Galvin had routed Harold Wells of the Miners **Federation**.

* He said that Pat Galvin completely 'rooted' the members of the Miners **Federation**.

* But I am not prepared to participate in any way in a method which emphasises the dependence of Australia instead of its independence and creates a precedent for further request and consent legislation which can seriously imperil the constitutional status of the 6 constituent members of our **federation**.

* During the last debate on this measure I think honourable members on both sides of the House quoted with approval from the booklet entitled 'Books are Different - A case prepared by the Printing and Allied Trades Employers **Federation** of Australia on behalf of the Federal Book Manufacturers' Group'.

* The foreword to this book states: 
Since **Federation** there have been changes in the rules on privilege in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom but still we have to go back to many of the rules it laid down at the time of the Commonwealth **Federation**.

* I can recall the occasion, for example, when Jim Healy, a leading communist in Australia and Secretary of the Australian Waterside Workers' **Federation**, used to come to Canberra and converse with  Mr Holt,  who was then the Minister for Labour and National Service, about matters pertaining to the waterfront.

* The Master Builders **Federation** of Australia has stated that in 1970 the value of all work of a nondwelling kind was $ 1,131m.

* This was a dinner connected with the formal opening of the Central Industrial Secretariat for the purpose of amalgamating 2 employer bodies - the Employers **Federation** and the Chamber of Manufactures - to co-ordinate their industrial relations policies.

* Mr Morgan  of the Metal Trades Employers **Federation** saw the wisdom of this.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and the Australian Workers Union were involved in a waterfront dispute over wheat with the Co-operative Bulk Handling Ltd in Western Australia.

* Yes, I have agreed to meet with representatives of the **Federation** on a regular basis.

* At our last meeting on 2 1 September I suggested that the **Federation** should make a submission to the Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training.

* Is it a fact that the Waterside Workers **Federation** has told the Federal Advisory Committee on Waterfront Accident Prevention that more should be done to allay the fears of workers handling asbestos.

* 'Survey of Construction Activity', conducted by the ANZ Bank with the co-operation of the Master Builders' **Federation** of Australia and the Australian **Federation** of Construction Contractors.

* We will provide a sound basis of financial independence and responsibility for the States and local government with the most significant reform of the Federal system since **Federation**.

* I am reminded that recently there was a complaint by  Mr Cowan,  who is the Director of FACTS - that is, the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Telecasting Stations - in relation to a programme on Fiji which apparently advertised some overseas airline.

* There have also been aspects of elections involving the Builders Labourers **Federation** which have been much less than satisfactory.

* In the context of the amendments that we are making to the Prices Justification Tribunal, we are hopeful that the **Federation** of Consumer Groups, in the establishment of which the Government has played an important part and which it certainly has encouraged - will exercise a valuable watchdog function.

* The **Federation** of Consumer Groups, by virtue of its specialised interest and the skills of the many well-qualified people whose services will be available to the movement, will be in a unique position to eliminate frivolous or unfounded complaints, to pinpoint cases where there is prima facie evidence of price abuse and to bring these cases to the attention of the Tribunal.

* As far as the Commonwealth's role in this whole problem of surplus production of wheat is concerned, for 18 months before the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** made its decision I had been pointing out the problems that were confronting the industry and were likely to arise if we continued to have an escalation of production and difficult marketing circumstances.

* As a result of this the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** made a decision that there needed to be some restraints put on production, lt determined a national quota and how this should be divided between the States.

* The **Federation** did this itself.

* I raise this matter as other foreign ships which have called at our ports have had to pay money to the Seamen's Union and to the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* In putting my questions to the Minister, I have in mind that some period ago he made known certain information to Charlie Fitzgibbon, the Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* It seems to me that there is a fanbit of collusion between the communistcontrolled Waterside Workers **Federation**, the communistcontrolled maritime unions and the Russians to try to break down efforts by other shipping companies which try to trade on the Australian coast while the Russians are free to do as they will.

* I cite the case of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation** referred to the Government's pension provisions in these terms: 
That is not a statement by a member of the Opposition speaking in this debate.

* It is a direct quotation from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** which views the future with apprehension because of this Government's manifest failure to take effective action to control inflationary forces.

* I repeat that it is quite remarkable to see the change in policy emphasis between this document and the concepts which dominated the thinking of the Liberal Party prior to the last **Federation** election.

* The deregistration of the union, which the Employers **Federation** supported so strongly and which the Opposition supported at the time it was done, was the act which removed the builders labourers from the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* After the deregistration of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation** under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Australian Government did agree- I do not know whether this is the gravamen of the complaint of the honourable gent- to the continued appearance of this union at the inquiry.

* Chambers of Commerce of Australia, arid, the Australian Farmers' **Federation** which included on this occasion a representative of the Australian Woolgrowers' , and Graziers' Council I have talked also with the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board.

* One of the difficulties that I have had in speaking in this debate is that only about 10 days ago the **Federation** of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, through one of its senior spokesmen, indicated quite clearly and conceded that discussions had taken place between the Government and the Minister.

* However, the information that I have is that the legislation that has been introduced is not strictly in line with the recommendation made by the **Federation**.

* I merely suggest that there is a slightly disturbed feeling that these negotiations entered into - I take it, quite freely - were not strictly conducted along the lines that the **Federation** would have wished.

* The 1918 Australian Labor Party conference abolished its platform for effective **federation** and adopted the following platform: 
The Bill is indeed consistent with our federalism policy, the most significant component of which is Stage 1 of the tax sharing formula, whereby an increase of 2 1 per cent on last year's allocation has been made in this Budget.

* This is one of the most significant developments that have occurred in Commonwealth-State relations since **Federation**.

* Shipping on the north coast will virtually be put out of business if, because of an amendment to legislation, small ships have to use Australian Waterside Workers' **Federation** labour rather than Transport Workers' Union labour.

* The Board indicated that the legislation then existing gave the Waterside Workers **Federation** a virtually absolute monopoly on stevedoring operations.

* At this time the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Limited had mechanised its bulk handling stevedoring operations in Sydney and was not employing Waterside Workers **Federation** members.

* shall grant exemptions from the need to use **Federation** members where the stevedoring operations concerned with the operations of an enterprise loading or unloading at wharves which form part of the enterprise and in relation to which the normal employees of the enterprise will be used.

* The wording of the Bill has been the subject of consideration by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and other unions.

* Talks have gone on today between the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and  Mr Fitzgibbon,  I think it is, of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** had intended its  Mr Docker  to come to Canberra tomorrow to discuss this matter with the Opposition Parties and with the Government 
Party.

* If, as a consequence of the talks we have with the Waterside Workers **Federation** and of the talks which take place between the **Federation** and the Opposition parties, it is thought that there ought to be some amendment of the Bill or that the amendments which have been moved or circulated ought to be accepted, the Government will be, of course, willing to do that in the Senate.

* Unfortunately the airline strike has hit the Waterside Workers **Federation** and its representative is not now able to come to Canberra tomorrow.

* I received a letter from the **Federation** of Catholic Parents and Friends Associations from the Archdiocese of Sydney.

* It is interesting to note that the **Federation** of Catholic Parents and Friends Associations is also concerned at the denial of support for the weak and oppressed, to which I have referred.

* The representations which came from that body are in these terms: 
This **Federation** represents parents who are not only rearing their own families, but have over the past few years been expected to pay ever increasing tax to cover the cost of antifamily Government policies.

* This thinking was introduced again in this place by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  who seemed to be saying that he wanted the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to make sure that any ships coming into the Port of Darwin would be unloaded by Transport Workers' Union labour rather than by Australian Waterside Workers' **Federation** labour.

* Apparently he believes that members of the Transport Workers' Union will unload ships at a cheaper rate than members of the Waterside Workers' **Federation** will.

* But I am firmly of the view that the only members of the Waterside Workers' **Federation** that he has ever met and spoken to are those working along the banks of the Todd River.

* He has, in fact, been prepared to preside over the most draconian monetary policy since **Federation**.

* I am proud, as a member from Tasmania, to say that one thing to which we can point, one achievement of this Government which is irrefutable, is that Tasmania is better off financially today than it has been since **Federation**.

* I turn from that to the recent move by the State Premiers to go to London but I observe in passing that to compare the Australian federal system in this context with the American federal system is to misunderstand completely the 2 separate systems of **federation**.

* This is the attitude of the Liberal Government in South Australia where a deputation from the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** was recently received by the Minister for Health in that State.

* In fact, before he would even discuss anything with this deputation he insisted that the industrial officer of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** make an apology for a public statement that he had made that the Minister was not really concerned with the nursing crisis, in fact, the Minister in South Australia was more concerned with his own personal feelings.

* What is appropriate to the Waterside Workers **Federation** is not appropriate to the Minister's old favourite union, the Australian Workers Union.

* Let us take the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* It can and does work for the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* It is certainly the case, as the honourable member has suggested, that work on the West Gate Bridge project in Melbourne - a major project for Victoria - has been held up considerably because of a demarcation dispute between the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation** and the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia.

* The national body for the industry, the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents, specifies the standard of premises which it requires before a travel agent is allowed to join the **Federation**.

* If prospective travel agents are to be registered by government and to be approved by their **federation**, 2 bodies will be looking at them to see whether they are the right type of person.

* There had been a gradual build-up in Commonwealth Government spending over the 72 years since **Federation** to $ 10,000m.

* I repeat we had a gradual build up to $ 10,000m from **Federation** to 1972-73.

* Members or organisations such as Federal and State livestock producers organisations, the Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council, the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Farmers **Federation** are all calling for a change in the structure of the Australian Meat Board.

* Following on the expansion of the Australian Grants Commission, which involved the recognition of 74 regional groupings of councils in Australia and the recognition of these groupings by the Minister, we have seen the most exciting development in local government since **federation**.

* The remarks of the Judge appear in his judgment in Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia (1960) 2 F.L.R.

* On page 380 of the .same edition, the editors express the view that the judgment of  Mr Justice  Dunphy in Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia (No.

* It is abdicating its responsibilities as a national government It is abdicating its responsibilities as the only government in Australia which can take this **Federation** and make it into a nation.

* The West Indies **Federation** came apart and instead of staying as a **federation** we now have Trinidad, Tobago and Guiana and various other places.

* The central African **federation** fell apart; it fell apart amicably.

* Over a lengthy period the Government has had discussions with a wide variety of rural organisations such as the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wheat Growers' **Federation**, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Farmers **Federation**.

* We are paying $8m a year for the very strong membership of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia to be able to stand the shipowners up and say: Now look, we are going to demand this kind of a payment from the economy.'

* I will read an article which appeared in 1970 in a Sydney waterfront publication known as Wharfie' and which described a dispute that took place on the waterfront between the Port Jackson Stevedoring Co. and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Opportunity is also being taken to amend the reference in the Act to the Wool Scourers, Carbonisers and Fellmongers **Federation** of Australia by retitling the **Federation** as Association, in keeping with the former **Federation**'s recent change of title.

* Let us consider the submission made by the Australian Teachers **Federation** to the Commonwealth Government on future funding for schools.

* There must be a clear reason to increase education expenditure in real terms, and in its submission the Australian Teachers **Federation** stated: 
Representation was then made to  Mr L.  Hills, solicitor, of Sydney who contacted  Mr Fogarty,  the Assistant Secretary of Labour and Industry, Victoria.

* Following moves between the Company and the Printing and Allied Trades Employers' **Federation**, a stay of one week was given Peter as it was found that the Country Printers Award covered the position and while embracing a preference to unionists clause carried the provision for application to the Industrial Registrar for a certificate of examption.

* The task that they are about in dismembering our **federation** can have one result only, that is, serious and irretrievable damage to our constitutional system and to our nation.

* This was part of the compact of **Federation** to ensure that if there were disagreements between the 2 Houses there would be a set way of providing for those disagreements to be resolved.

* The former Treasurer at the annual dinner of the Metal Trades Employers **Federation** used the occasion to dictate to the  President  of the Commission, who was also a guest, what the attitude of the Commission should be in regard to the applications of the unions for increased wages in the 1967 work value judgment.

* So blatant were these attempts to influence the Commission that the  President  stated: 
Australia is a **federation** and the states have the responsibility for most of the activities which are closest to the lives of people - Education, Health, Housing, Conservation and a wide range of others.

* It is an authentic tragedy that the House should be discussing this Bill when, for the first time since **Federation**, the whole idea of decentralisation and the whole notion of growth centre development are under challenge.

* We saw the formation of the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** of Tasmania.

* For the first time the fruit growers of Tasmania banded together in a group and for a short period they were effective, but as their numbers dwindled- I repeat that they went from over 1 100 in 1966 to fewer than 500 recently- so too did their influence diminish and the **Federation** went out of existence.

* Next I want to say - and I want this to underlie anything I say - that I congratulate the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* 1 am of the opinion that the men in the Wheatgrowers **Federation** are dedicated to the proposition that wheat growers should get the best deal that this country can give them.

* Well, I cannot see the members of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** panicking.

* Let us suppose that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** did not worry about the quotas which have been fixed by the **Federation** in conjunction with the State governments which have given the quotas legislative authority.

* Throughout this debate I have heard no-one put forward anything which would be more advantageous to the wheat growers than what is being done by the **Federation** and the Australia Wheat Board.

* The bottom could drop out of the minerals market at any time, but the primary industries built this country and they maintain it In the 24 years that I have been in this Parliament I have defended primary industries and advocated the best possible deal for them more than has any man since **federation**.

* Fifty years ago the Americans realised what was necessary to deal with the securities market in a **federation** of States.

* I do not know whether  Senator Rae  still supports this view, but this was the Committee's view: 
I have no formal knowledge of the reasons which prompted the Queensland Branch of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** to institute this enquiry.

* At the moment the ACT Schools Authority, the Federal Department of Education and the Australian Teachers **Federation** are having somewhat of a difference over the staff ceilings which probably will apply in 1979.

* Unfortunately the position is being exacerbated by people who are trying to confront senior Ministers of this Government and by the Teachers **Federation** which is holding stop work meetings a little early in the battle which it thinks is to come.

* I must express disappointment tonight that the Teachers **Federation** could not have waited another week or so so that this industrial problem, this problem about the future of our children's education, could be settled in a responsible way.

* He claimed it was a record year of achievement unsurpassed in the history of **Federation** for the Parliament to pass the number of Bills which were passed in 1973.

* But this is an argument of 1974 which did not have appeal in the 74 years of our nation's **Federation**.

* The Prime Minister who said last December that we did not need a tourist as Prime Minister has blundered into more diplomatic gaffes and foreign policy humiliations than any Australian Head of Government since **Federation**.

* He planned to address the Teachers **Federation** on modern capitalism on 22nd May.

* Once we forgot that we are a **federation** we will forget our responsibilities as members in this House and as members of the Australian community.

* If we do not make the **federation** work soon in a real sense the whole of this country's fabric will be undermined.

* That is not the choice at all; the choice in Australia is whether the **federation** survives as a **federation** on the one hand or, on the other, whether we have a series of nation states.

* With the dynamism and drive of our new federalism policy, with the States being given the opportunity to do things as they should have been permitted to do them under a federal system for 75 years- they are getting their first chance in the 76th year of our **federation**- I believe that we will be able to give the housing policy of this country a tremendous drive.

* But with respect, I say that is not a mis-statement because in a **federation**, the problems of house owners in New South Wales may be totally different from those of house owners in South Australia.

* I remind the House and honourable members opposite that the Senate, and the power given to it under section 52, was fought for by Tasmania and the other smaller States and their representatives prior to **Federation**.

* Mr Wright  has informed me that the question of telethons and appeals on radio and television has been taken up with the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters and the **Federation** of Commercial Television Stations.

* As part of that consent 2-year award both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers **Federation** gave a written undertaking there would be no stoppages of work in respect of those matters which were the subject of that agreement.

* In relation to other conditions of employment not covered by the agreement reached before  Mr Justice  Moore the Waterside Workers **Federation** gave an undertaking that it would progress all claims with the employers through established procedures and take all reasonable steps to ensure that work continued normally while these negotiations were in progress.

* It is common knowledge that since then some members and branches of the **Federation** have embarked on stoppages ranging from 1 hour to a full day on issues covered by these undertakings.

* I am informed that the ACTU and the federal officers of the **Federation** have done their utmost to ensure that the undertakings which they gave in the proceedings before  Mr Justice  Moore were honoured.

* Secondly, the Government will be giving close attention to the per formance of the **Federation**, its branches and its membership recognising they are one of the principal parties to the agreement.

* The parties to the National Conference Agreement can scarcely be expected to endorse a new agreement in 1972 unless branches of the **Federation** and their members can establish their bona fides in respect of the unexpired terms of the current agreement.

* It is to be regretted that the **Federation** in some branches has also become the vehicle, along with certain other maritime unions, whereby minority elements within the trade union movement have sought to convert industrial power into political action.

* In some instances unilateral concessions by individual employers have led to industrial stoppages when the **Federation** has sought to extend the gains made.

* On the credit side it is fair to say that the technological changes which have occurred in the stevedoring and shipping industries since 1967 have been achieved with the co-operation of the Waterside Workers' **Federation**.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with ACTU policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* This was the conception at **Federation**.

* I am particularly interested to see that the Australian Farmers **Federation** at long last has come to realise that the rank and file - that is, the farmers who are out on the job - who are feeling the cost-price squeeze, are all in favour of the type of action that the Government is proposing at the present time.

* Since **Federation** successive governments have fallen down badly on their responsibility to Aboriginal advancement.

* The power under clause 13(3) to exempt will undoubtedly apply to such unions as the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The only decentralisation success seen in Australia since **Federation** is right here in Canberra.

* I think the Committee will agree with me, upon due deliberation, that that principle upon which, generally speaking, retrospective laws are not favoured simply does not apply in a case involving people who for years, indeed ever since **federation**, have ordered their affairs on the assumption that the laws made by the State Parliaments, unless specifically directed - which they never were - to Commonwealth places, had a general application in those places; so it could not be said that people committing activities of a criminal nature were undertaking those activities in the belief that they would be exempt from criminal law in relation to those activities.

* It carried out wide-ranging investigations and produced 3 reports which documented firm support for the School from commercial film producers, the **Federation** of Commercial Television Stations, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Commonwealth Film Unit, guilds and unions, and education institutions.

* That is what the Labor movement and Labor governments since **Federation** have striven for.

* The Committee includes representatives from the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**, the Australian Agricultural Council and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and also a representative from a university and from the department.

* The committee is to consist of 2 representatives of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**, a departmental representative and one person chosen for his marketing experience.

* The **Federation** is to nominate to the Minister the representatives of its body to be appointed.

* Turning to the price provisions of the Bill, the change proposed is as a result of a further recommendation by the Australian Wheat Growers' **Federation**.

* In September 1969 the **Federation** asked that the price provisions of the complementary legislation be altered to give the Wheat Board discretionary authority to sell wheat for stockfeed and industrial uses at a price below the going home consumption price of $1.71.

* During the recent hearing by the Coal Industry Tribunal of an application by Australian Iron and Steel Limited for an extension of multiple shift longwall mining operations a submission was advanced by the Miners **Federation** that there should be a reduction in weekly hours of work in mines where such operations are introduced.

* I am now referring, of course, to the statement made recently to the **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufacturers by the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch)  who seems to be adopting completely the market oriented, Industries Assistance Commission approach.

* Recently, because of the discrimination that exists in the clause we are discussing, the Minister saw fit to criticise the Waterside Workers **Federation** which had come to some form of agreement with its employers outside the court.

* Although under the Australian Constitution the financial responsibility for local govern ment is purely a matter for the States - when **federation** took place this was one aspect of government which was allocated to the various States - I nevertheless feel that the Federal Government has a financial interest in local government and should make the muscle available for it to carry out the works which I have enumerated.

* Rather the indications are that the Executive, steamrolling its supreme authority down the throat of the people of Shortland, wants to featherbed  Mr Charles  FitzGibbon of the Waterside Workers **Federation** or some other left winger into this seat.

* The executive government of this country represents in the main only one man, the man who sits at the head of the Cabinet table, and the situation has never been very different since **Federation**.

* When we have a law that has remained in the present form of the Public Service Act since **Federation** and we alter it in the dramatic way that the Government is now proposing, the Government has a duty to the people of Australia as well as to the Public Service of Australia to allow the Parliament of Australia to know fully what it is proposing to do and to have the intricate and complex provisions of the legislation put to legal examination so that the Opposition can come back into the Parliament next week with the benefit of at least one week's mature consideration of what the Bill proposes.

* However, the report has been described by  Dr Malcolm  Potts, the Director of the International Planned Parenthood **Federation**, as 'biased, highly emotive, and in at least one of its statements totally incorrect'.

* General Manager 1955-56, President **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters 1962-63.

* I think it is worth noting that the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia pays the University of New South Wales to run trade union courses for that union.

* I am fearful of the infringements to the civil rights, liberties and freedoms of the Australian people that have been upheld since **federation**.

* Mr Evan  Phillips, the General  President  of the Miners **Federation**, has said: 
The Central Queensland Coal Association also will bring the new Peak Downs open cut into production this year.

* The Miners **Federation** contends that in Queensland, as in New South Wales, open cut production should be regulated by integrating open cut and underground mining to preserve the mining life of that region and to bring long term benefit to that State and to the nation.

* The privileges of this House and of the Senate are those which existed in the House of Commons at the time of **Federation**.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rale to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with ACTU policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* This  laissez-faire  formula is short-sighted and it would fragment our **Federation**.

* The decision runs counter to the assumption, held and acted upon by both Commonwealth and State governments since **Federation**, that State laws are not affected by section 52 (i.)

* At the end of that decision, for the first time since **Federation** and for the first time since the end of the Second World War when our great immigration program commenced, the  President  directed and found it necessary to order formally that his decision be printed in several languages, because he thought it proper that everybody affected by that decision should be able to read it and understand it.

* Later it was referred to me by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** with the request that my Department investigate the proposition.

* If I correctly recall the reply that I gave to the **Federation** concerning the findings of my Department  -  i would be happy to let the honourable member have a copy - it was to the effect that whilst it was technically feasible to produce power alcohol from wheat it was not an economic proposition.

* In view of this sort of information I had to inform the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** that the advice of my Department was that this proposal was not economically or technically feasible.

* At the time of **federation**, as my learned friend from Moreton  (Mr Killen)  has said, there were various ways of determining where, in the case of a bay, one drew the base line.

* For your information, I have written to the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters intimating that the application of the revised charges will be deferred for the time being to give the **Federation** the opportunity, if it so desires, to present a case for the nonimplementation of those charges on a selective basis according to their effects on the financial position of individual stations concerned, or, alternatively, for phasing in the changeover to the new rates over a period of years.

* Doubtless the effect of the new charging arrangements on the financial position of each of the radio stations concerned will be commented upon by the **Federation** in its submission and this will be taken into account by the Minister for the Media and myself when reviewing the matter.

* I remind the House that when this matter was referred to the Privileges Committee we members of that Committee had to work on terms of reference which had been laid down at the beginning of **Federation** in Australia and which went back into the last three or four centuries.

* A survey of 336 members of the Master Builders **Federation** of Australia and the Australian **Federation** of Construction Contractors reported tight profit margins, depressed levels of activity, a surplus of unemployed labour and tough competition for the inadequate supply of available contracts.

* He was addressing the Central Industrial Secretariat of the Australian Council of Employers **Federation**.

* I am going to show him today what a complete aboutface he made in a few days because of an unscrupulous Prime Minister leading an unscrupulous party which decided to be unscrupulous and force- 
The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a **Federation**, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* If they had done so, local government would have received its greatest boost since **Federation**.

* At the election of 1 3 December last we witnessed the people of Australia remove from office a discredited Whitlam Labor Government and saw installed the present Liberal-National Country Party Government with the greatest majority that any Australian Government has enjoyed since **Federation**.

* Sure enough, the Waterside Workers **Federation** contingent won the cup and was presented with it.

* That document sets out the history of Commonwealth and State financial relations since the beginning of **Federation**.

* I answered a question put to me by a member of the audience who turned out to be  Mr Baltinos  of the New Settlers **Federation** and I presume it is this **Federation** to which the question is intended to refer.

* (a) The New Settlers **Federation** provides services for migrants.

* My Department does not extend to the **Federation** official recognition or support nor does it regard the organisation as representative of the migrant community 
(b) I am not aware of the **Federation**'s membership figures.

* (c) The precise nature of the services rendered by the **Federation** are not clear.

* Mr Baltinos established the **Federation** in November 1960.

* I am unaware of any official information published by the **Federation** about its activities or of any financial statements, membership details or other reports.

* I have studied a detailed paper on the **Federation** prepared at  my  request by my Department 
At present the unemployed are virtually powerless and voiceless.

* The establishment of the self-help groups in the Victorian **Federation** of Self-help Groups is a tentative but significant step forward for the unemployed to participate in the decision making processes on issues that really affect them.

* One means by which this could be done would be through consultation with the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters.

* What is actually happening in the Commonwealth sphere, in relation to decentralisation after 70 years of **federation**?

* Having said that and having drawn the attention of the House to the quite specific and undeniable usage of the word 'grant' as it is understood by all persons concerned with implementing the provisions of the Australian Constitution, I should like to go on and say that this Government, unlike any of its predecessors stretching back as far as **Federation**, does recognise the very heavy debt burdens of local government and semi-government authorities and the inhibitions which the debt burden imposes on these authorities in providing the services which Australians have come to expect of them.

* We attempted for the first time since **Federation** to institute legislation to prevent monopolistic, collusive and restrictive trade practices and, above all, we wanted to initiate a national companies Act.

* In fact, to date I have had no firm consultations with the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** with respect to the first advance.

* I hope that in terms of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** I can comply with the honourable gentleman's request.

* Australian Federal-State financial relations have undergone a process of change since **Federation** in 1901.

* I want to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and the Australian Wheat Board which have done a magnificent management job in helping to organise the supplies and the sales of Australian wheat overseas.

* lt is easy for the honourable member for Riverina to keep saying that there should be a payment on over-quota wheat, but he says this against the wishes of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** which has firmly laid down the principle that there should be no payment on over-quota wheat.

* He is opposing and defying his own Party's principles, and he is treating the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** with contempt.

* Who would shoot a Tasmanian to keep Tasmania in the **federation**?

* The honourable member would shoot them to keep them in the **federation**; the Treasurer would probably say he would pay them to go.

* It did so in order to meet the Australian Farmers **Federation**'s concern that the position of self-employed groups was not sufficiently recognised in the policy guide lines laid down for the Industries Assistance Commission.

* The Government added to sub-clause (3) a provision which met representations by the Australian Farmers **Federation** thai the new Commission should not be plunged immediately into the complex task of providing recommendations on rural matters such as the wheat industry stabilisation and marketing arrangements and the review of the CommonwealthState Sugar Arrangement.

* It is for the Australian Government, and the Australian Government alone, to decide who shall and who shall not receive assisted passages or entry visas to this country - and (his has always been the case since **Federation**.

* But I maintain that Australia's immigration policy should bc based on the principle laid down by successive governments since **Federation**, that we need to maintain a homogeneous population.

* The level of financial assistance provided to the Australian Amateur Fencing **Federation** for the staging of the 1979 World Fencing Championships will be reviewed by the Sports Advisory Council in 1978-79 and 1979-80.

* During the period in which this Government has been in office, conferences have been held between the stevedoring companies, the Australian Shippers' Council, the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and other bodies with an interest in the stevedoring industry.

* I also remind honourable gentlemen opposite that it was achieved not only as a result of the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Kirby and  Mr Northrop,  Q.C., now  Mr Justice  Northrop, that there should be direct negotiation and direct consultation between employers and employees; it was also accepted unanimously by the Waterside Workers **Federation** to work in a private enterprise situation.

* I commend the Waterside Workers **Federation** for coming to that conclusion.

* Whilst it has accepted the present arrangements, the Waterside Workers **Federation** has reserved the right to resist any suggestion of involuntary redundancy.

* I hope that the Waterside Workers **Federation** will be more realistic in the coming months and years and change its attitude on this matter of redundancy.

* Did the Victorian Employers' **Federation** assert on the same day that any further delay in abandoning the Budget strategy would add to the grave doubts already expressed over the competence of our present leadership?

* Will he, in the light of these comments from sources normally sympathetic to his Government, reconsider his rejection of the views put forward by the right honourable member for Higgins and thus avoid delay in correcting the economy which the Victorian Employers' **Federation** described on Sunday as 'the height of electoral folly'?

* Recently in the House I had the opportunity to inform honourable members that one of the features of the settlement was that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers **Federation** proposed to sign an agreement the terms of which, if I recall them accurately, are that there will be no stoppages of work on any issue of wages or conditions which were the subject matters of these negotiations.

* Within the framework of their own concepts of **federation**, the present problem is irreconcilable.

* 1 ) Royal **Federation** of Aero Clubs of Australia $22,000 per annum.

* The Gliding **Federation** of Australia $19,000 per annum (including payment in recognition of a number of responsibilities delegated to the **Federation**).

* Association of Australia in 1972 to assist in sponsoring the First Medical and 'Scientific Congress of the International Planned Parenthood **Federation** was its only response.

* Since the present Government came into office on 2 December it has provided grants of $225,000 for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, $125,000 for the International Planned Parenthood **Federation**, $200,000 for the Family Planning Association of Australia and $100,000 for the National Catholic Welfare Committee of Australia which will be repeated as an annual commitment.

* Historically, the Act was drawn from the audit Acts of the States in force at the time of **Federation**, but its origins can be traced to the British Exchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1 866.

* This does no more than give proper legal backing to procedures which have been followed for many years, probably since **Federation**.

* But a problem is added to the situation when we consider that after Parliament had accepted this amendment- after the Minister, on behalf of the Government, had accepted it- the Minister then appointed a person named  Mr Jack  Mundey, a conservationist and Treasurer of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* We have got, I think, the present Treasurer of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation** as representing, might I say, onethird of the Parliament's decision to appoint to this important Advisory Committee 2 people who were competent in the fields of the environment and conservation.

* The frustrations that have been forced on this Government have produced a situation today where it is necessary for the first time since **Federation** to hold a joint sitting of the 2 Houses of Parliament to ensure the passage of this legislation.

* The honourable member for Gippsland said during his speech that redistributions carried out from **Federation** up until the present time have been fair, honest and equitable.

* I am sure that every responsible member of the Australian Wheat Board and members of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, and informed people in the Australian wheat industry must listen in fear when they hear the Australian Labor Party continue its policy of trying to make it politically impossible for Australia to make a wheat sale to the People's Republic of China.

* Even  Mr Price,  the  President  of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, has publicly asked politicians to keep quiet on the subject and to keep out of the field.

* As soon as the Liberal-National Country parties believe that the popularity of a Labor government has dropped, as inevitably it must at some stage during its term then if those parties control the Senate, as they have done for much of the time since **Federation**, they will move to disallow the passage of the Budget or Supply once again.

* Operating, as we do, in a **Federation**, there were of course differences of opinion, and these are difficulties that any Australian Prime Minister and any Australian national government would have to face.

* All of the political par ties represented in this House reflect the characteristics of the Australian **Federation**.

* The States lost their international personality - to whatever extent they ever had an international personality - at the time of **Federation**.

* the Queen's assertion of sovereignty in the territorial sea, recognised by international law, was not delegated to or conferred on the Australian colonies before **federation**.

* Its membership was drawn from organisations with standing membership of the Stevedoring Industry Consultative Council and consisted of representatives from the port authorities, stevedoring employers, including representatives from Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, the Australian National Line, the Waterside Workers' **Federation** and the Australian Shippers' Council.

* It was about 4 feet wide and 7 or 8 feet long and was presented on behalf of the Teachers **Federation** of New South Wales, lt, of course, was putting a case for that organisation.

* One of Australia's largest farmer organisations - the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** - has condemned the present tactics of the Commission and has recommended thai the Government should act as quickly as possible to acquire the entire wool clip.

* -After listening to that little diatribe it is perfectly obvious that the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Baume)  is completely owned by the New South Wales Colliery Owners Association and the Road Hauliers **Federation**.

* We have heard from him an explanation in this House of all the accusations that the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has made about some of the goings on in Wollongong many years ago when the communist-led Waterside Workers **Federation** was given a very large trophy by the honourable member for Mackellar.

* It was led by the honourable member for Prospect and included a previous member of this House, whom I never knew to be interested in repatriation until then; the very optimistic Labor candidate for the seat of Moreton, which is the seat of my colleague, the Minister for Defence; and a member of the Hospital Employees **Federation** of Australia.

* It concluded that relief ratios in our repatriation general hospitals were appropriate and it advised the **Federation** of this on 26 October 1978.

* On the subject of guilt by association, I point out that when the late Harold Holt was Minister for Labour and National Service he had to meet on many occasions with the Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation** at that time,  Mr Jim  Healy.

* I believe that this Liberal dominated Government will rank as one of the most hypocritical governments in this field since **Federation**.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation**, with a membership of about 100,000 teachers, has made a thorough and objective study of the Interim Committee's report.

* The **Federation** states: 
Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia 
The Authority of course will not have power to determine Government policy other than that which is written into the Bill.

* At the moment it is the policy of my department, while we are waiting for  ACPA  to be established, to give all the financial assistance we can to the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations, leaving  AFCO  to determine how the money will be dispersed to the various other consumer groups that are either affiliated or not affiliated.

* I repeat quite categorically that we shall continue to allocate moneys to  ACPA  for the purpose of supporting the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations, SAA and consumer groups.

* Where SAA standards have been set - 
I remember a few years ago reading some of the old debates on social services going as far back as the early stages of **federation**.

* Then, $10 billion of the taxpayers funds were required for the national expenditure after 72 years of the **Federation** of States and after 72 years as a nation.

* The Interim Commission was also asked to examine general issues pertinent to consumer protection, to encourage the formation of a **federation** of consumer organisations, to investigate consumer education, to arrange liaison between Federal and State consumer officials and, most importantly, to make recommendations about a permanent body that should ultimately take its place.

* One of the achievements of the Interim Commission was to bring together consumer organisations to form the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations.

* This now enables a consumer viewpoint to be expressed with the backing of the **Federation**.

* This Bill seeks to grant Commonwealth public servants one additional week's leave and in considering the Bill it is imperative to bear in mind that when it is passed by this Parliament it will result in the first increase in annual leave for Commonwealth public servants since **Federation**.

* They were awarded 3 weeks leave at the time of **Federation** at which time State public servants received 3 weeks leave and in fact had done so since the 1860s.

* The Australian population is very fortunate to have an efficient and highly-skilled public service which has served this nation well since **Federation** without scandal or any suggestion of corruption.

* Last year some 153 500 dwellings were built in Australia, which is a record for any Australian government since **Federation**.

* The Summers report highlighted the need for modernisation of existing legislation and one can appreciate how that is absolutely vital when one considers that after almost 80 years as a **federation** our shipping industry has been regulated largely by British legislation drawn up for the purpose of a nineteenth century colonial empire.

* The unions are as follows: the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, the Federated Clerks Union of Australia- that is a bunch of silvertails if I have ever heard of one!the Airline Hostesses Association, the Australasian Airline Flight Engineers Association and the Flight Stewards Association of Australia.

* I want to quote from a speech made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to the Australian Farmers' **Federation** on Tuesday, 23 October 1973.

* The Rae Committee was at some pains to point out that the industry concerned is not only national in character but fundamental to the development of a national Australian economy- an objective of **Federation**.

* The dispute involving the Builders Labourers **Federation** has led to positive decisions that the construction of buildings would not proceed simply because people do not want to get embroiled in any way with the **Federation**, and again hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost.

* This does no more than give proper legal backing to procedures which have been followed for many years, probably since **Federation**.

* The requirement as it stands is impracticable and has its origin in the early days of **Federation** when the expenditures of the Commonwealth were quite limited in volume and extent.

* Immigration has been a Federal matter since **Federation**, especially since the great post war government sponsored immigration programs.

* A belated amount of $2.2m was put into this area last October but the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** now estimates that at least $9m is required in New South Wales alone.

* However, it does wish to see some positive action taken on the proposal emanating principally from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** but supported by the Australian Wool Industry Conference that growers' contributions to the market support fund should be repaid to the growers once the fund reaches a certain level.

* I came into this House earlier this afternoon and apologised to the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and to the Minister on a matter which as a result of public reports I had accepted in good faith but later found to be inaccurate, namely, that International Labour Organisation arrangements, International Transport **Federation** arrangements and flags of convenience were a quite different matter from the matters under examination at the present time.

* Time after time the present State Government has produced policies which, in the long term, are directed at ensuring that New South Wales will become the poor aunt of the Australian **Federation**.

* As the Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  remarked when he spoke earlier in this debate, that speech was an extraordinary departure from the proprieties and conventions which have controlled the content of second reading speeches since this Parliament was formed at **federation**.

* The purpose of honourable gentlemen opposite is to divert attention from the fact that the Australian electoral system, which is embodied at present in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and which has remained substantially unchanged since **federation**, produces one of the most electorally just systems in the world.

* At **Federation** - only 70-odd years ago - half the Australian population lived in rural areas.

* Delegates to the convention of the **Federation** of Australian Broadcasters, which includes some Labor Party controlled stations, unanimously affirmed their determination to support the principles that the public is best served by the continuance of the freedom of the commercial broadcasting industry to program their stations in accordance with the demonstrable interests of the communities which they serve.

* That is part of a resolution passed by the **Federation** of Australian Broadcasters.

* There have been allegations by the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents - 
I will check the date afterwards and let the honourable member know.

* In respect of the ACTU Jetset operation, a number of allegations have been made and the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents- AFTA- has complained to me that it believes there are kickbacks coming from foreign airlines to ACTU Jetset.

* I suggest that this is a severe condemnation by the **Federation** of Australian Broadcasters of the legislation now under consideration.

* I believe that the action of the Opposition in drawing attention to the dangers that exist in the Bill is serving not only the Australian **Federation** of Broadcasters but also the Australian community.

* When the parties to the National Conference - the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority - endorsed the report, the Government agreed to provide legislative authority to cover these and other matters.

* In May 1970, under the Chairmanship of a  Deputy President  of the Commission,  Mr Justice  Moore, the employers, the ACTU and the Waterside Workers' **Federation** reached agreement on a number of matters which were awarded by consent.

* This is one of the major social moves since **Federation**.

* Thus, in a letter to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  dated 24 September, the Australian Farmers **Federation** expressed its strong support for the mandatory provisions of clause 23.

* The Australian Farmers **Federation** is of the opinion that mandatory provisions should apply equally to primary and secondary industry.

* The secretary of the **Federation** writes: 
In regard to the Cocos Islands Act which was passed 3 years prior to that in 1955, there was a similar provision relating to a request and consent being made by this Parliament.

* But I would invite the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that all of the components in the Australian **federation**, all of the States, remain legally tied to the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the Statute of Westminster.

* The United Kingdom created colonies which were transformed to States when the **federation** was established.

* But if the reports that appeared in the Press are correct and if other reports that one hears have validity, the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation** did not approve of those particular plans and the Minister was persuaded, therefore, to postpone or to forget them: It is unlike the Minister to duck a fight if a fight is necessary to achieve a particular ambition or wish that he might have.

* The General Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation** is there reported as having said that no new arrangements would be proposed by the Minister until the end of 1975.

* I hope that the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation** was not speaking for the Minister on that occasion.

* However, it was infinitely more than the industrial unrest of 1966 -and 1967 when the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and the Waterside Workers **Federation** and others were negotiating the arrangements for permanent employment which are now in force.

* There are the National Industry Council of AEWL and the Terminal and Depot Employers **Federation**, known as TDEF.

* I would have hoped that the Waterside Workers **Federation** would also have relished seeing that these matters were controlled by Australian interests.

* Suggestions have been made in the past - I think the Minister's troubles in part flow from this - that the AEWL and the Waterside Workers **Federation** come to their own particular agreements.

* The 3 September 1973 issue of the Victorian Employers **Federation** report states that last year 11,000 disabled people were registered in Victoria as wanting employment but only 4,800 were placed.

* The report of the Victorian Employers **Federation** continues: 
The Commonwealth has responsibilities in this matter.

* The States lost their international personality at the time of **Federation**.

* If he is neither candid nor credible - and I think the evidence supports this point of view, unkind as it might seem, but substantiated and put objectively - he is at least being consistent with the record of the non-Labor parties since **Federation** in respect of national superannuation, national social security insurance, or whatever term is preferred.

* After **Federation** a number of people of Pacific Island descent were resettled in the Torres Strait and they live there today.

* With the mechanisation by the ship owners and the many different ways of transporting cargo, people who belonged to unions other than the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia, were performing tasks which were very similar in nature to those tasks once performed by waterside workers but which, because of the introduction of technology and mechanisation on the waterfront, are now in fact vastly- different tasks.

* Clearly there must be some agreement between the Government, whose job it is to administer these regulations and these laws, and those who will work under them, because if the Government becomes autocratic or if the Opposition, persisting with its amendment, should push the Government into doing something which does not meet with the agreement of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, then of course there will be immediate conflict.

* The Government has also actively encouraged the establishment within Australia of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Groups.

* The Government met representatives of consumer groups and, after giving them some indication of why we wanted them to give a voice to us when we are framing legislation which is of vital interest to consumers, we left the meeting and the representatives proceeded to draw up the ground rules for the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Groups.

* in 1901 - that was at **federation** - Australia's population stood at 3.75 million.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* It is in the case of a **Federation**, where the central legislative and executive bodies are largely competitive with, and in a sense adverse to, the State authorities.

* One must praise the open and flexible attitude of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** through all the negotiations and the way that it did not seek to make political capital of the deliberations.

* That statement at Alice Springs was highlighted in an advertisement placed in the newspapers throughout Australia by the Road Transport **Federation**.

* That legislation states that the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** should each appoint 2 representatives.

* This proposal went against the recommendation of the  president  of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**,  Mr Campbell,  who said at the time that he believed that the pig industry should provide its own funds for promotion.

* The other members are a marketing specialist and two members of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**.

* The producer representatives are nominated by the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation** and the others by the respective organisations.

* I think this is one of the peculiarities and the difficulties of **Federation**.

* He, like his colleagues on the Opposition side of the chamber, believes in a confederation, not a **federation**.

* There is nothing even like the compact clause in the United States Constitution which enables agreements between State governments in that **federation** to be given formal, legal supportlimited as this provision may be.

* Aside from this, for 75 years we have operated in an essentially  ad hoc  fashion in attempting to create orderly arrangements between the governments of the **federation**.

* We have 4 tory governments in this so-called **federation** which choose to continue to compound the situation by their hotchpotch of interstate corporate affairs commissions.

* Later this week I hope to meet with representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation** when they will put to me their recommendations on the first advance that they will request for this wheat selling season.

* In the early years after **Federation**, employees of the Commonwealth Public Service set a standard for the rest of Australia in conditions of employment.

* The meeting was chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and attended by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, two Liberal backbenchers (Messrs Edwards and Dean), myself- representing the Opposition and the Shadow Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Chris Hurford), the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce and two of his officers,  Mr Laurie  Carmichael of the AMWSU,  Mr Len  Townsend, Federal Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia,  Mr Ron  Luckman, Assistant Secretary of the ETU, representatives of manufacturers, components makers, the **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufactures.

* I believe that one of the gravest mistakes that has ever been made by any government since **federation** was that men were conscripted to be sent overesas in an undeclared war.

* I believe that some people in Western Australia would be prepared to seize all power and even secede, no matter how illegal such action would be, from the **federation** to establish a totalitarian system of some son without giving 
The Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organizations.

* In the case of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations, an initial grant of $10,000 has been approved for the establishment of a secretariat and the provision of further assistance is still under consideration.

* The first observation to be made about this Bill is that it seeks to reach out into the State legislatures in a way that was never within the contemplation of the founders of this **Federation**, and to direct their affairs.

* We are now on about our one hundred and fortieth half-yearly run since **Federation**.

* We will again give the people the opportunity to face up to their constitutional responsibilities rather than do what governments and people of this country in fact have done since **federation**, that is, to rely upon the High Court for any meaningful constitutional change by way of High Court interpretation rather than changing the Constitution by way of referendum.

* The orderly marketing of wheat has been considered by the States, the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** and the user industries.

* On the credit side it is fair to say that the technological changes which have occurred in the stevedoring and shipping industries since 1967 have been achieved with the co-operation of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* But I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the position generally within the industry has improved vastly over the last few years, and had it not been for the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Woodward conferences, as they turned out to be, as I said a few moments ago, the industry could be in a vastly worse position than it now is and in a worse position than a lot of the countries that the Minister referred to in his second reading speech.

* It is all very well for the honourable member for Denison to talk about maximum wage rates in some ports and to pay no regard to those areas within the responsibility of the **Federation** that are not so fortunate.

* The **Federation** is a trade union which down through the years has held sacrosanct the protection of its members irrespective of whether they be in A, B or C class ports.

* We have no desire to break the record of the Labor Government of having the largest Ministry of any Australian government since **Federation**.

* Another article referred to what  Mr Darling,  the Executive Director of the Employers **Federation** of New South Wales, said about the situation.

* Does he honestly suggest that the Education Executive of the Episcopal Conference of Australia, or the National Council of Independent Schools, or the Australian Parents Council, or the Australian Teachers **Federation**, or the Australian Council of State School Organisations do not have sufficient competence and do not have sufficient interest to nominate effective people to be placed upon this Schools Commission?

* The adoption by this Government of the Aus.tralian Grants Commission's recommendations for 1974-75 is the greatest boost local government has received since **Federation**.

* The Master Builders **Federation** has had a look at this matter and has stated quite clearly in its report that in the absence of more precise definition the functions are without limit in regard to construction or development activities while there is a dragnet provision for catching any other legislation in operation or to be enacted.

* -After weeks and weeks of build-up, meetings with the Cattlemen's Union of Australia and subsequently the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Government has managed to devise a higgeldy-piggeldy program in an attempt to assist the Australian beef industry and to take the heat off itself.

* The States have had power to control prices since **federation**.

* As the honourable member will know, the basis for distribution of wheat after the introduction of wheat quotas was as a result of recommendations by the Australian Wheat **Federation**.

* The **Federation** made recommendations to governments on the total quantum of wheat that should be distributed and on the allocation amongst the States.

* How many people realise that in 72 years of Australian **federation** the Budget reached $ 10,000m but in the next  2Vi  years it went to $22,000m.

* The Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots without doubt is using the pilots of Connair Pty Ltd not to increase the pay rates in the simple way that the pilots think but for the **Federation**'s own malevolent ends.

* I am totally satisfied that the **Federation**, from its approach to the question when it has held discussions with the pilots in the Northern Territory and from conversations I have had with pilots, has no ends in view other than to use the Connair pilots as whipping boys when it takes on the major airlines later this year.

* I might have more to say about that again after I have heard officially from the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots as to how conversations went today.

* This arose as a result of a compromise at the time of **Federation**.

* **Federation** could never have been achieved without the smaller States being granted equal representation so that they would not be neglected at the expense of the bigger States.

* That is the position over many years almost since **Federation**.

* All-risk crop insurance has received consideration in Australia, principally by the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation**.

* We have never had the right to express our point of view in the 30-odd referenda which have been presented to the other people- the real people of Australia- since **Federation**.

* Whatever their justification may be for making such a protest against Canberra as the seat of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, whether it be directed against one or other of the political parties, most people would agree that there can be no genuine justification for using this issue to deny fellow citizens a fundamental right which they themselves have enjoyed since **Federation**.

* Representatives of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** called to see me last week, seeking an assurance that provision would be made for an early payment to growers.

* I understand that the Wheatgrowers **Federation** was to meet with  Mr Day,  the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, this morning.

* So we have to contend with this phoney Government, which is led by one of the most conservative, class conscious persons that this country has been unfortunate enough to have as its Prime Minister since **Federation**.

* By holding stop work meetings during school hours, the ACT Teachers **Federation** is striking at the interests of parents.

* There might be those who would be unkind enough to suggest that it might not be unrelated to the fact that in last Saturday's  Canberra Times  there was an announcement of elections for office bearers of the Teachers **Federation** and indeed that the pre-selection by the Labor Party for the seat held by the honourable member for Canberra at present is to be held next weekend.

* The Standing Committee on Agriculture, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and officers of the Department of Primary Industry are aware of this fact, as is the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* At this point of time, I cannot make any further comment until these discussions are concluded, except to say that tomorrow there will be a meeting between the Miners **Federation**- 
lt is interesting to know that the Leader of the Opposition apparently is not interested in this matter, which is of vital importance to a large number of people in New South Wales and of importance to our economy as a whole.

* I was pointing out, in conclusion, that I cannot make any further comment at the moment, except to say that tomorrow there will be a meeting between the Miners **Federation** and the Joint Coal Board.

* Will the Government accede to the request of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to pay a first advance on the 1976-77 wheat crop of $65 per tonne or about $1.80 per bushel?

* The **Federation** of Child Care Association members who provide 80 per cent of child care in Australia at the moment, as I understand it, have not been consulted.

* It is quite true, as the honourable gentleman says, that there has been a sense of responsibility indicated or evinced by the Waterside Workers **Federation** in Melbourne.

* I applaud the Waterside Workers **Federation** for it, and I applaud him for applauding it for what it did, because it is sensible in industrial relations to give credit where credit is due and not always take an institutionalised attitude towards things and simply assume that employers are always wrong or always right, and vice versa in respect of the unions.

* On the question of the shorter hours that have been negotiated by the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  against this agreement were not surprising.

* Mining and processing give us very much opportunity nationally and, in particular, give an opportunity to the 2 less populous but larger States of the **federation**, Queensland and Western Australia.

* A reason for the great strength of the trade union movement in Sweden is that the unions are bound together by the powerful LO **Federation**, which has the necessary clout to make binding decisions for all its affiliates.

* It came in for similar criticism in a letter written by Professor Niland President of the **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations.

* Is it a fact that the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots insisted and the Department of Civil Aviation agreed that the information they contained should not be used in the investigation of air safety incidents or of any accident where the flight crew survived (Department of Civil Aviation Special Investigation Report, Page 12).

* It was the most expensive afternoon tea we have had in the history of **federation**.

* The point about the 1 day sitting is that we had the most expensive afternoon tea in the history of **federation** while the people who hoped to get something from the Meals on Wheels legislation received nothing.

* Yet, of the top 10 programmes - I quote from the recently released publication of the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations titled 'Facts of Australian Content in TV Schedules' - 6 of the top 10 programmes are Australian.

* There is more money at stake - I hate to intrude this note - in the fate of this measure than there has been in any other measure that has come before this House since **Federation** because with the continental shelf of H million square miles and with the north-west continental shelf, undoubtedly the greatest undeveloped treasure house of oil and natural gas in the world today, the last thing the Government wants is to upset its financial arrangements.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except In respect of internal waters as they existed at **federation**, the States have no such rights.

* It has been so in this Commonwealth since **Federation** and we on this side of the House see no need to take it out.

* The Bill, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh stated, does no more than make provision for the waterside workers in Darwin who were previously members of the North Australian Workers Union to become members of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act was enacted in 1967 to give legislative effect to an agreement entered into by the National Stevedoring Industry Conference, under the chairmanship of  Mr A.  E. Woodward, Q.C., on which the stevedoring employers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Department of Labour and National Service and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority were represented.

* More important, however, is the fact that the original agreement entered into between the **Federation** and the employers in 1967 in relation to the terms and conditions of employment expires in May this year and they have recently completed negotiations for a new agreement.

* This Bill, however, makes State boundaries revert to their boundaries as at **Federation**.

* Some authorities believe the closure distance at **Federation** was 10 miles and some believe it was 6 miles.

* Thus, the Commonwealth would acquire not only all these structures but also any areas built up by the States since **Federation** - for example, Port Kembla, Portland, Warrnambool and Port Latta.

* The Conference was attended by the stevedoring employers, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and my Department.

* These committees will comprise representatives of the relevant employers and the **Federation** and other interested parties such as the relevant port authorities will join with these committees in consideration of matters of concern to them.

* The Association of Port and Marine Authorities advised the National Conference of its wish to do this and since then the Association has met with the employers and the **Federation** and there is now a very clear understanding that at both the Federal and the port level there will be a continuing involvement of the port authorities in the affairs of the industry where their interests are concerned.

* The Committee will be a part time body consisting of representatives of the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, the Australian Shipping Commission and the Waterside Workers' **Federation**.

* This Division was inserted in the Act in 1956 and provides the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with its jurisdiction for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes and industrial questions involving that area of the waterfront in which work is performed by members of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia.

* If the Government is so concerned about the focussing of public attention on public discussion of the Australian exchange rate and the level of Australian reserves I find it rather remarkable that last week, on one day alone, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  should have done more than any other person in this country has done since **Federation** to focus attention on that issue by attacking me publicly three or four times.

* I find it remarkable that there should be so much contrived concern about discussion of the exchange rate when, in one week alone, the Prime Minister issued more significant comments than any other person has issued on the state of the exchange rate of this country since **Federation**.

* The Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** raised these matters with the IAC in its submission.

* I seek leave,  Mr Speaker,  to incorporate in  Hansard  the submission by the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia to the IAC.

* The truth is that the revenue sharing arrangements, the new federalism arrangements, unveiled by the Opposition, as it then was towards the end of last year, are certainly the most dramatic and the most significant development in government relations since **Federation**.

* Mr Wran  knows that our policy has appeal because people see in it a genuine attempt to end the wrangling that has gone on over the years between the Commonwealth and the States, a genuine attempt to give financial reality to the Australian **federation**.

* It is the most significant development in government relations that has occurred since **Federation** and will end for all time the inevitable drift, the inevitable concentration of power in Canberra.

* In the 73 years since **federation**, Federal courts have been established to deal only with matters of bankruptcy and industrial law.

* Is the Minister aware of a statement made by  Mr George  Meaney, the  President  of America's major union organisation, the American **Federation** of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations, that he is disenchanted with  Strikes  and that his organisation has appointed a committee to search for an alternative weapon to strikes?

* The right honourable member for Melbourne quite properly queries a matter of substance at the present time, namely the negotiations between Qantas Airways Ltd and the Air Pilots **Federation**.

* He quoted from a number of statements made in Canberra yesterday which appeared in the newspapers this morning and which were attributed to the  President  of the Australian Farmers **Federation**.

* He said that the Australian Farmers **Federation**, in common with other national organisations, naturally looked for their support in matters of mutual interest.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal waters as they existed at **federation**, the States have no such rights.

* It is these costs, of course, which were recognised by Interlaine and the British Wool **Federation**, being the owners of wool at the point of shipment, and as a result of these increased costs they agreed to the establishment of the 4 per cent freight increase.

* Great problems in respect of health are brought about by the system of **federation** under which we live.

* I agree with **federation** and 1 support it.

* and (2)1 have received representations from the Australian **Federation** of Child Care Associations which is an association representing the commercial day care sector, recording details of a survey of vacancies in child care centres in the commercial day care sector.

* I am unable to determine whether the results of the survey conducted by the **Federation** are correct; in those centres from which information was obtained, the indications were that a vacancy rate of 30 per cent existed.

* Mr Speaker, my colleagues have admirably commented on the twin cancers of inflation and unemployment that were the products of the worst government since **Federation**.

* It is history now that he pulled the political plug on the worst government since **federation**.

* Essentially the reason is that in the big ports the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority can declare people redundant only if the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour and the Waterside Workers **Federation** take the initiative, or it can happen on the recommendation of the AEWL in association, in certain circumstances, with the WWF.

* It is clear that the **Federation** would have no interest in taking any initiative in respect of redundancy.

* Wimmera has been an electorate since **Federation**, a mere 74 years ago.

* These grounds were best exemplified and made clear to the people of Australia when recently the International **Federation** of Airline Pilots Association stated that Brisbane Airport as a capital city airport did not receive the top rating that other cap.tial city airports received.

* I will quote firstly what Captain Holt, a former  chairman  for many years of the Air Pilots **Federation** of Australia had to say.

* He stated in Brisbane on 7 April 1 977 in an interview for the  This Day Tonight  television program: 
Would the Government put a muzzle on all the Italians who complained about the activities of FILEF- the **Federation** of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families.

* I say to this House and to those people of Australia who are concerned about the actions of this unfair union that the Utah Co is presently paying International Transport **Federation** rates of pay and conditions and that the average wage of these seamen is $ A9.000 per annum tax free.

* The people who do not want to go on to Australian wages are the Spanish seamen because in fact they would be getting less money and their terms and conditions of employment would be far less attractive than they are at present Also, under the International Transport **Federation** rates of pay - 
-Also, under the International Transport **Federation** rates of pay agreement and the agreement which has been reached with the Spanish seamen, the employer-that is, Utah-pays the tax of the Spanish seamen.

* But more importantly, the question is being asked in many places: Can they survive as independent small nations or should they consider some form of loose **federation**?

* My own view is that the ideal solution for the governmental structure of these islands of the South Pacific would be some form of loose **federation**.

* I would hope that this **federation** could include Papua and New Guinea, for it is not possible to think about the political viability of the islands in the South Pacific without considering the future of Papua and New Guinea.

* A **federation** rather than a unified state should be our aim.

* The first **federation** in the West Indies was imposed by the British Government when it handed over control.

* The strains were too great and the **federation** broke up.

* How dare the Australian Labor Party accuse the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  of being the author of divisive policies and statements, when the Australian Labor Party earned for itself the reputation of being the most divisive political force in this country since **Federation**, a party which callously and shamelessly sought to divide the Australian community in every conceivable way.

* We certainly have the best parliamentary representatives from Tasmania since **Federation**.

* During the period 1926 to 1932, he was the General Secretary of the Miners **Federation**.

* There were two young barristers in the case- one named R. G. Menzies, who was appearing for the mine owners, and the other named H. V. Evatt, who appeared for the Miners **Federation**.

* Finally, Menzies subpoenaed the minutes of the **Federation**.

* Because  Mr Colin  Mann, the  President  of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation**, spoke to a seminar in Orange recently, we now know to a large degree the shape and form of the next five-year plan.

* For example, they addressed their appeals to the Waterside Workers' **Federation**, which held up about $1m worth of newsprint which was on the wharves.

* This was the first time that a pension increase had been back-dated since **federation**.

* Let it admit that it is not able to continue the negotiations with the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Nevertheless, I think it is important to point out that there appears to be strong evidence that national priority should be devoted to forward planning in our port facilities in association with future expectations of trade and to the provision of financial assistance to upgrade those facilities for the benefit of the Waterside Workers **Federation** and for the benefit of the Australian people.

* It is an approach which has been accepted by the State governments which are party to any arrangements and by the wheat industry through its central spokesman, the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation**.

* The payments of various descriptions which have been made to the States have continued since the beginning of **federation**.

* I do not know that the Federal Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation**,  Mr Townsend,  would be terribly pleased if the honourable member advised him he was being led around by the nose by  Mr Carmichael  and  Mr Halfpenny,  any more than would, I believe the Federal Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, for example, a fine radical organisation in some areas, or the Federal Secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association.

* If we want to preserve the **federation** in something like its present form, we should at least spell out why we want to do that.

* When dealing, in effect, with the referral provisions - they are apposite to the matter before the House - this is what  Sir John  Cockburn said shortly after **federation**: 
We stand by, year after year, while vast amounts of taxpayers money are wasted on sterile disputes concerning the extent of Commonwealth and State powers while the taxpayers of the Commonwealth have to listen to Australian and State governments passing the buck back and forth.

* The founders of **Federation** certainly would not have subscribed to that view.

* It may be reviewed either as a loose confederation of quasi-independent States or as a national **federation**.

* It must in my opinion serve the purposes of an Australian **federation** of States and not preserve a confederation.

* I find that the shocking decision of the Gorton Government not to allow the Snowy Mountains Authority to carry out any construction works in Australia, not even in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory, is a decision which must rank as one of the worst political decisions ever made by any Federal Government since **federation**.

* They are talking about the activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* Honourable members opposite ought to be honest enough to put forward the real reasons why they are opposed to the activities of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* The 35,000 people who build the homes and multi-storey office blocks in this country are still financial members of the Builders' Labourers **Federation**.

* I repeat that in relation to certain provisions it changes laws such as the Merchant Shipping Acts of 1 894 and 1900- not of this Parliament but of the United Kingdom- which have been the law in this country since **Federation**.

* If honourable members study the Constitution Act they will see that in the initial stages it was not necessarily intended that Western Australia should become a member of the **Federation** in the first instance.

* As it turned out, Western Australia did become a member of the **Federation**, and I think that was very much to the advantage of this country as a whole.

* However, that just indicates that at that stage some of the States and very many people in Australia did have reservations about whether we should join together in a **federation** of the various colonies.

* In fact, the problems that were associated with the forming of the **Federation** have in many cases become worse with the passing of the years.

* He had been in this and in the Victorian Parliament, as the Prime Minister stated, for 43 years - more than half the life of our **federation**.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal waters as they existed at **Federation**, il has sovereign rights in this area.

* Does the Government support the establishment of a **Federation** of Ethnic Schools.

* -Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware that the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** has written to members of Parliament seeking to have  Mr A.

* At the present time, and since **Federation**, these have been treated as within the jurisdic- tion of the States.

* At the time of **Federation** in.

* Interstate inequalities of fiscal capacity are not a transitory characteristic of the Australian **federation**.

* In the legislation of this Parliament at the outset of **Federation** the enactment clause read as follows: 

 - Mr Speaker, it is my sad duty to inform the House that  His  Majesty the Paramount Ruler of Malaysia died suddenly during the afternoon of 29 March.

* Honourable members will be aware of the unique provisions of the Malaysian Constitution for the rotation of this office among the nine rulers of States within the **Federation** of Malaysia.

* -The unprecedented rejection of Supply by the Senate last year was the most serious assault on our constitutional system of government since **Federation** and the full impact of that unprincipled act by the Liberal-Country parties has not been realised by most Australians.

* Since the introduction of uniform income tax all successive federal governments, Liberal or Labor, have seen fit to continue it as being the best way to manage the financial affairs of our nation- as a **federation**- as one Australia, as one country, not as 6 colonies each going its own way.

* What is of paramount importance is thai if Australia is to continue to develop as a **federation**, with the best interests of the whole nation as the objective, there has to be a uniform taxation collected by the Australian Government.

* The Opposition seeks to divide, dismantle and disintegrate our system of government, to undermine and destroy our **federation**, our nation.

* There would have been no **Federation** if that power had not been reserved to the Senate.

* This Government has presided over the worst inflation, the worst unemployment, the worst industrial strife and the worst economic crisis this nation has known since **Federation**.

* Darling Executive Director of the Employers **Federation** of New South Wales,  Mr K.  D. Williams,  President  of the Australian Chamber of Commerce,  Mr C.  F. Sullivan, the Acting Director of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, and  Mr J.

* In the Associate News of the Technical Teachers' Association of Victoria I saw a letter from  Dr George  Smith,  President  of the Australian Teachers **Federation**, who sent the following letter to both the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Fraser,  and the Leader of the National Country Party,  Mr Anthony.

* It states: 
The members of the Australian Teachers' **Federation** would constitute one of the largest groups of subscribers to a superannuation fund in Australia.

* The most important benefit contained in the Budget is the genuine and most significant reduction m personal income tax since **Federation**.

* He failed to mention that his predecessor had to defend the best result the non-labor parties had had since **Federation**, and that had there been a further swing of a little over one half of one per cent he would have lost a further 6 seats, namely, Parramatta, Paterson, Bendigo, Deakin, Henty and Griffith, and would have faced a Labor majority of 21 seats.

* It should have enough guts not to pull the wool over people's eyes, but to say that it joins with the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations, which has continually monopolised the media.

* They said that if it were the case that the Government decided there would be an increase in the number of outlets to consumers - 
The people from the **Federation** believe that there should not be any further outlets, but that if there are, they should come under the control of one organisation.

* The **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations has had a bonanza.

* Does he intend to require the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations to adhere to their obligations?

* For example, in the reasons for decision diven on 12th September 1966 in the case of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia and others and General Motors-Holdens Pty Ltd the Commission said : 
**Federation** for any government to change electorates towards 10 per cent from 20 per cent above or below the quota- the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  suggests that that is a very significant point- it is also without precedent for the Senate to reject Supply, which apparently the Leader of the Opposition does not think is a significant point.

* The Leader of the Opposition has raised, as quite a proper question, the activities of  Mr Mundey  - among others but primarily  Mr Mundey  - of the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* He is the gentleman who, in the August/September edition of the 'Aus tralian Left Review", which I assume is read by honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House, said: 
The fact is that  Mr Mundey  was at that stage the New South Wales Secretary of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* We are all aware of the importance of our work which is basically that of making this Committee, the first of its kind in the House since **Federation**, an effective instrument of parliamentary scrutiny.

* In particular I thank the  Deputy Chairman  of the Committee, the honourable member for 
Another point that needs to be made is that the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Australian Council of Trade Unions are participants in an agreement in relation to the waterfront.

* In regard to the series of questions which the honourable gentleman has asked, what I understand will happen now is that the Australian National Line and the Waterside Workers **Federation** will negotiate within the terms of the Stevedoring Industry Council agreement, and I would not presume to say what the result of those negotiations will be.

* The only control on tobacco advertising at present is a voluntary code initiated by the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* I only hope that the spirit with which the honourable member for Wannon endows the State education systems and the other bodies, with the idea of using **federation** as a co-operative undertaking, is the case.

* If we are going to consider **federation** as a co-operative undertaking, the time has come for a good deal of the politics to be taken out and a lot more of the principles injected into relationships between this Government and several of the Australian mainland State governments.

* Has he designated for this purpose either the British Wool **Federation** or Interline?

* That was a shameful shabby political deceit, a confidence trick of proportions unequalled by any other event since **Federation**.

* When the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** recognised that declining world trade was building huge surpluses of wheat throughout the world, it set to work to devise a policy to rationalise production so as to avoid the chaos which would have occurred had action not been taken to restrain production in some way.

* We were both guest speakers in Melbourne last night at the Australian Boot Trade Employees **Federation** centenary dinner.

* The indemnity payments admitted to have been made to the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The second point is that the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  has promised immunity to the Waterside Workers **Federation** on this very question.

* He had become an official of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Northern Territory is being held to ransom by the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* The **Federation** imagines that it will achieve its ends, for its own purpose, by attacking Connair.

* The **Federation** of Air Pilots must have known that.

* All I am saying as a Territorian is that we do not think very much of the action that the **Federation** has taken.

* If the deal falls through, the lack of transport in the outback of the Northern Territory to places like Numbulwar and Roper River, will be due fairly and squarely to the actions of the **Federation**.

* The **Federation** knows that.

* (b) Adequate grants in aid to the Stales by the Federal Parliament with special consideration for the disabilities under **Federation** of the States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania.

* Over the same 23 years of Liberal rule the debts of local government - I remind the House that it is local government of all the levels of government in our **federation** which is required to finance virtually all its capital works from borrowed money - increased no less than 10i times.

* It would allow the Waterside Workers **Federation** generally to come in and to claim the right to have as members the small group of persons who would have to be permanently employed in order to handle that limited amount of general cargo which goes across the employer's wharf.

* If the amendment is allowed to stand in the form in which it is proposed by the Government it would extend the monopoly which the Waterside Workers **Federation** is seeking right around the coastline of Australia.

* I know from my own experience of practice in the industrial field how anxious the **Federation** is to extend that monopoly right around the coast and to intrude into areas such as the one where by statute it presently is excluded and also to intrude into ports where previously it did not have the monopoly power.

* Following my statement to the House on 9th March 1966, Australian forestry, including this proposed programme, was thoroughly debated both in this House and in the Senate for the first time since **Federation**.

* Australian **Federation** on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency; 
Since **Federation** in 1 90 1 , the States have experienced successive reductions in their financial independence.

* I have read in the newspapers a report that 2 major wool growing organisations - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** - have unanimously supported the proposal that there be a single marketing authority for the handling of the Australian wool clip and that this opinion has been supported unanimously by the 
It is now perfectly clear that the trade union movement has entered into the field of politics.

* Mr Bull  of the Waterside Workers **Federation** has said: 
The **Federation** would never have succeeded if the Senate had not been created.

* It was designed to make sure that at any time no one State or combination of States could dominate the **Federation**.

* I draw attention to section 5 of part I which states: 
Will he give early consideration to the introduction of an Archives Bill to establish an archives section in his Department, or in the National Library, to receive and classify and make available for examination and study by historians and students and other people genuinely interested, records of historical significance from all Government departments since **Federation**.

* I have always thought that the purpose of a **federation** is to form a nation.

* This is a matter between the Commonwealth of Australia and the components in the **Federation**'?

* Has his attention been drawn to reports of grants this year by Finland  of  $100,000  to  the International Planned Parenthood **Federation**  to  help their work in developing countries and $150,000  to  the United Nations Fund for Popula  tion  Activities.

* If so, is it proposed that Australia will join the other Scandinavian countries, Britain, Canada, Japan and the United States of America in making similar donations to the **Federation** to help its work in reducing the growing number of deaths by starvation.

* Finally, there should be no attempt through this inquiry to consign the ABC to the role that the commercial lobbies, the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the **Federation** of Australian Radio Broadcasters have long sought.

* Mr Bob Sample, the  President  of the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**, similarly made reference to this later problem.

* With respect to the prices, as outlined in this Bill which amends the principal Act, the change proposed again is the result of further recommendations by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* In September of last year, as the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  points out in his second reading speech, the **Federation** asked for some amending provisions to be introduced with respect to the price of wheat in Australia.

* With regard to assistance to rural industry, if one looks at the figures one finds that this Government has given more in real terms, taking into account costs, than any previous government since **Federation**.

* It is, in the Committe's opinion, more in accord with democratic principle and the develop ments since **Federation** that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one half of the number of States.

* They agreed to proceed with the estab- lishment of a **Federation** and appointed a steering committee to draw up a constitution for further consideration.

* It is envisaged that the proposed **Federation** would be a focus for consumer opinion and would advise the Government on consumer matters.

* It has been talked about by nearly every government since **federation** but it has never been enacted.

* At the same time, the Minister accepted the proposal by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** for a national delivery quota for 1973- 74 of 514.4 million bushels, plus 20 million bushels on a special pool basis at any stage when there was excess.

* It is far from the Government's intention that this should open the way to Government interference in the wheat selling operations pf the Board, but it will be obvious to honourable members and it has in fact been clearly stated to the Wheatgrowers **Federation** that, as the Australian Government assumes the financial responsibility of guaranteeing the plan from public revenue, then, in the interests of the taxpayers generally, it cannot be indifferent, for instance, to the price at which the Board may be willing to sell wheat at some particular time or to some particular market.

* For example, I note that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** have combined to call for pensions to be set at a sum equal to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* The effect of paragraph (n) is that these employees neither need to be registered as waterside workers nor to be members of the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the employer does not need to be registered with the Authority.

* The real issue here, of course, is what we are going to allow to develop in future and what have we learnt from our experiences since **Federation**, particularly since the advent of television and the high cost of conducting a campaign.

* Then in the Governor-General's Speech there is talk of bringing about the most important reform of the Federal system since **Federation**.

* I mention next the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** Credit Union Ltd.

* In Canada by virtue of a special legislative provision, the question was referred to the Supreme Court, at the instance of the **Federation** itself in relation to the Province of British Columbia.

* Sovereign control over the mineral resources of both the territorial sea and the continental shelf was held to be vested in the **Federation** alone, to the exclusion of the component States or Provinces.

* However, the Australian Teachers **Federation** noted in its report on the 1 979-80 Budget: 
Because of the value of the comments of the Teachers **Federation**, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  those few pages comprising the report.

* In West Germany, which has a population of 61 million, practically all unionists are covered by 19 unions and that includes 2 or 3 unions not inside the **Federation** of Labour.

* I do not think that any Federal parliament in a **Federation** ought to lend itself to that sort of practice.

* Another gentleman, the  President  of the Australian Farmers **Federation**,  Mr D.  Eckersley, told the Treasurer,  Mr Howard,  that the Bank was little more than a joke.

* A media release from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation** states: 
The Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation** expressed its extreme disappointment with the new Primary Industry Bank of Australia.

* Since **Federation** there have been only eight all told, and three of them were successfully put through by this Government last May.

* State governments have had that responsibility since **Federation** and they have been severely lacking.

* Thus the Government was confronted with a (wo-headed monster by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** when discussions began in earnest at the beginning of 1968 for the new and continuing stabilisation plan.

* The **Federation** asked for a more realistic and upward revision of a number of important elements in the industry's cost regimen as welt as an increase in the quantity of the export guarantee to restore the relativity of this most important element of previous plans, lt came as no surprise that the Government started to look around for a way out of this dilemma, and even less surprise that when the trap was finally sei the **Federation** - with ali the gullibility in the world - walked straight into it.

* Using the information from this survey and absurdly high valuations of the farms surveyed provided by the Commonwealth Bank valuers, discussions began with the **Federation** for a new base price.

* The **Federation**, at the same time, assisted by its economic adviser, had been examining items in the former cost regimen and made representations to the Minister for a review of these items.

* Mr Speaker,  the stage was set to say to the **Federation**: 'Well, let us take the figures derived from the BAE survey the capital valuations of the farms as supplied by the Commonwealth Bank valuers, your ideas as to what should constitute such imputed items as owners-operators' allowance and deductions for sideline income, together with what you believe should be the yield divisor, and let the Bureau of Agricultural Economics bring up a cost of production price'.

* The price projected exceeded $2 per bushel, a price the industry had never received, one which no government could ever be expected to cover, even to the tune of 150 million bushels - '.et alone the 200 million bushels the **Federation** was seeking - and a figure which, if it was a true cost, must have meant that every wheat grower should have been bankrupt.

* The absurdity of the situation thus created knocked the wind out of the **Federation**, and while it was gasping for breath the Government delivered the king hit by discarding the whole concept of a stabilisation plan based on a cost of production figure, and offered the **Federation** - on a take it or leave it basis - a plan based on 170c for home consumption wheat and 145c for up to 200 million bushels of exports.

* No useful purpose will be served by traversing the course of the negotiations which followed this offer by the Government, nor anything gained by reviewing the unedifying performance of the **Federation** at this time.

* Suffice it to say that the **Federation** later asked the Minister, and received his acquiescence, to a face saving proposal that it should design a cost formula which added up to 170c.

* Australian ports, or about 5c per bushel below the export guaranteed price of the 200 million bushels covered by the Government offer to the **Federation** With the export minimum price for Australian wheat artificially set at a level which destroyed its competitive position in world markets, with the home consumption price arbitrarily raised to a record high level and well out of line with the price of other cereal grains, and with enormous carryover stocks on hand and a record acreage being cropped, the Government, with the concurrence of the **Federation**, had again set the stage for the present farce.

* It was interesting at this time to note that of the 10 growers' representatives sitting around the Australian Wheat Board, 6 were directors of State handling organisations and 1 a chairman of directors, and at that time president of the **Federation**.

* This was the situation when the Minister invited the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to submit a proposal to cope with the pending crisis.

* After some preliminary discussion the **Federation** finally got down to the business of meeting the Minister's request, and what is now known as the Quota Delivery Plan emerged from the annual meeting of the **Federation** held in Perth at the middle of March 1969.

* The official reports of the **Federation** meeting, as well as the statements subsequently issued by the Minister as part of his acceptance of the **Federation** plan, reveal quite clearly that the proposal was to restrict deliveries and first advance payments on the basis of the average deliveries to the Australian Wheat Board for the years 1963 to 1968 inclusive, rounded to the next million bushels, but to reduce the average entitlement of the Slates of Western Australia.

* But the **Federation** steadfastly turned its back on the geographic advantage of Western Australia in respect of its proximity to major markets, particularly China, lt is common knowledge that the Chinese would load most of their ships at Western Australian ports if the Wheat Board would permit them to do so.

* Nansen K.1 isa, Secretary,- Milne Bay Native Societies Association and Member, Board of **Federation** of Native Societies.

* M..B.E., Secretary of **Federation** of Co-operative Unions and Member of the Development Bank Board.

* It is unique also to see a Liberal Minister of the Crown sitting down with the Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia at several meetings, having fruitful, progressive and helpful discussions and coming to decisions which, by the look of it, both parties will honour.

* I am sorry that the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  did not commend the Minister on this point, but I think that the Minister very wisely is not opting for a confrontation with the Waterside Workers **Federation** by forcing redundancy.

* As  chairman  of the Industrial Relations Committee of the Government, I commend the secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation**,  Mr FitzGibbon,  for the patience and tolerance he has shown so far in these negotiations.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation**, and probably the Seamen's Union, the Transport Workers Union and everybody else would have a national strike.

* : the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and the Federal Dairy Council.

* 1 ) Was there a strike by members of the Australian Capital Territory Teachers' **Federation** on Tuesday, 12 April 1977.

* have the right to request staff members to indicate whether they will or will not be taking part in strike action where the strike action has been previously and publicly announced by the Teachers' **Federation**.

* Before **federation** the 6 Australian colonies shared one thing in common.

* When the colonies became States and entered the **Federation** they still shared that and the **Federation** was the inheritor of the common law.

* This has been one of the great expedients in Australia common to no other country where a **federation** has come into being and federal jurisdiction has been conferred on the components of the **federation**.

* As a matter of fact, it has been said by the  President  of the New South Wales Parents and Citizens **Federation** that the committee is still in operation on this matter and that the figure of expenditure needed over the next 5 years to bring education up to scratch is not a reliable figure because the research has not been completed.

* Since shortly after **federation** Australia has had a system of conciliation and arbitration which was designed to settle, by peaceful means, industrial disputes between employers and unions- a system which has provided many advantages for employers, unions and the community.

* The award covering the Vehicle Builders Employees' **Federation** of Australia contains stand-down provisions.

* He misses the point that it is at the request of the Australian Teachers **Federation** and the teachers themselves that appeals from determinations of the Public Service Board under our proposals or from determinations made by the Commission without the Public Service Board's approval under the Opposition's proposals may be made to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration 
The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota Tor a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a **federation**, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* The variation of 20 per cent from the quota, which we intend to reduce, has been provided in the Commonwealth Electoral Act since **Federation**.

* We believe, in the words of the great Chief Justice Warren of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in 1964- 
Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation** 
Australian Cattlemen's **Federation** 
The recent election of the Parliamentary Librarian,  Mr Harold  Weir, to the Parliamentary Library's Section of the International **Federation** of Library Associations, is an indication of the high regard in which this Parliamentary Library is held by information scientists, research specialists and librarians overseas.

* the history of the Commonwealth Parliament since **Federation**, including biographies and photographs of all Senators and Members; 
It is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Amendment Bill.

* I think that it is important to state, as the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  points out, that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** requested the Commonwealth and the States to introduce a scheme that would discourage the growing of unacceptable varieties of wheat in Australia.

* This also is supported by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* I do not wish to elaborate a great deal more on the Bill, except to say that it has the support of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* It is very relevant to note- and I believe this was referred to by  Sir Bede  Callaghan in his report- that this Government has given more to Tasmania and is giving more to Tasmania than any other government since **Federation**.

* I am simply referring to the fact that financially Tasmania is getting a better deal today than it has received since **Federation**.

* In the remaining two minutes that are available to me- I thank the Opposition for again stifling my endeavours to speak on Tasmania's behalf in this Parliament- let me say that there is a very strong case - 
-When we were elected to government on 13 December 1975, we unfortunately inherited a vast number of economic problems including the highest level of unemployment that Australia has ever seen since **Federation**.

* The federal director of the **Federation** of Australian Radio Broadcasters,  Mr Foster  - 
I would like to address my remarks to our present arbitration system.

* With the coming of **federation**, in 1904 a Commonwealth Act was brought into effect.

* Where direct financial commitment by the previous government was concerned, my understanding is that the granting of $10,000 to the Family Planning Association of Australia in 1972 to assist in sponsoring the First Medical and Scientific Congress of the International Planned Parenthood **Federation** (part of 1 (iii) to my reply on 30 May 1973 (Hansard, page 2923), was its only response.

* International Planned Parenthood **Federation** $125,000 for 1973/74.

* We may apply that to our experience since **Federation**.

* But following that proposition he was then concerned with the position of the States within the **Federation**, and it was at this stage that we saw those well known and well generated crocodile tears streaming down the pages as he read.

* The Treasurer in his second reading speech - and nothing in this Bill can be examined without bearing this in mind - had this to say: 

 Mr David McKenzie (New South Wales),  President  of the Australian Fencing **Federation**, executive member of the Australian Olympic **Federation**  (Chairman).

* Mr Julius Patching (Victoria), former General Manager of two Olympic teams and now Secretary of the Australian Olympic **Federation**.

* that exists throughout the **federation** .

* (a) At the time of **Federation** the annual leave entitlement for employees of the New South Wales Government was: 
(a) At the time of **Federation** the annual leave entitlement of daily paid employees of the South Australian Government was: 
Finally, the most damning support that the right honourable gentleman has had came from the Australian Farmers **Federation**, ft joins the IDC supporters.

* I invite them, together with the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt),  who has presided over the greatest destruction of rural industry since **Federation**, who is not in the House at this the first time that we of the Opposition who sit in this chamber of the Parliament have had an opportunity to nail him to the desk and who is badly represented in this chamber by the Minister for sugar at the best of times- I invite them, as well as the Minister for gerrymander, who is sitting at the table at the moment, to a meeting on Thursday night at Narromine.

* The problems that I have mentioned have bedevilled Australian companies and securities law since **Federation** and they will not be solved by abdication of responsibility.

* **Federation** delegates were, to say the least, highly embarrased that they suddenly had to jettison one of their best men.

* Eventually support was given to it by the trade union movement whose members began to see that, if they were to preserve the increased share of the gross domestic non-farm product which they were able to receive for the year ending September 1974, amounting to 6.2 per cent- the most massive transfer from capital to labour that had ever occurred since **Federation**- they would need to index the wage system so that that increase could remain real over the period of years for which the wage indexation proposal was to operate.

* Australian Insurance Staffs' **Federation** 
The discussion of this matter of public importance is designed to pave the way for substantial innovations in the functioning of this Parliament.

* Our parliamentary institutions are still geared to the atmosphere of the early years of **federation**.

* I am ashamed to admit in the presence of so many distinguished visitors in the gallery that the Australian **federation** still lags some way behind the mother of parliaments.

* If they do reject the Budget they think they will make history not only in the Australian **federation** but in the Englishspeaking world, in parliamentary systems throughout the world.

* The electoral laws which had existed for 70-odd years, since **Federation**, and which were supported by successive Labor governments- fair Labor governmentshad stood the test of time and trial.

* Is it this union - that is, the Waterside Workers **Federation** - which has the record achievement of more time lost through strike action than all other unions in Australia combined?

* At that meeting this need was made known to  Mr Justice  Moore by way of a question from a person who I understand represented the Employers' **Federation**.

* The policies of this Government have given more attention to the State of Tasmania than ever before in the history of **Federation**.

* Labor policies have created the highest escalation in building cost since **Federation**, a grave shortage of houses, flats and units both for sale and for rental, and the most unsatisfactory and yet expensive boarding house type of accommodation in Australia.

* It has been specifically rejected by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The oft repeated statement of the honourable member for Riverina, namely, that the Labor Party would take in all wheat no matter whether it was within the quota or outside the quota and pay $1.10 first advance, was certainly rejected by the honourable member for Dawson in his comments last night, and also by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** right across Australia.

* The  President  of the Australian Farmers **Federation** did come to see me last week.

* This is the first chance we have had for a long time to change a system that has operated since probably right back to **Federation**.

* I make one last point: Conditions in the Australian States differ less than they do in any other **federation**.

* It is obvious from work done by Professor Williams in Chicago that the levels of standards as between the poorest and richest Australian States differ less than they do in any other large **federation** in the world.

* Manufacturers' **Federation**, the Department obtained specific advice from Trade Commissioners at twenty overseas posts on the latest prospects for exports of Australian cheese.

* Further, in perhaps a more cerebral, academic circumstance, employers were discussing this matter at a seminar conducted last January by the Victorian Employers **Federation**.

* Of course, no one can seriously suggest that since **Federation** the parties to which honourable members opposite belong, irrespective of what they have called themselves, have given the depth of thought to the people in receipt of social security payments or social welfare payments that the Australian Labor Party has given.

* It has one federal organisation, namely, the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, with one commodity to sell although it might have a commodity made up of 16 or so different qualities.

* When this Government came to power on 2 December 1972 it immediately set about a long overdue reform of the Australian electoral laws- laws that had helped one government to stay in power for the previous 23 years and which had helped to keep the Australian Labor Party out of power for a total of 55 years of the previous 70-odd years since **Federation**.

* Parliament is under the gravest threat since **Federation**.

* The instrument for the destruction of the power of the House of Commons- the power over the purse- is the very instrument, the Constitution compromise, by which the disparate States of Australia reluctantly, grudgingly and with the greatest possible caution finally agreed to **federation**.

* By way of contrast to the findings of the eminent people to whom I have referred, the  President  of the Australian Teachers **Federation**,  Mr Van  Davy, who is no doubt a friend of the honourable member for Batman, said at the **Federation**'s annual conference in Hobart earlier this month that up to one in eight adults in Australia is functionally illiterate and that 320,000 school children at present need extra help in literacy and numeracy.

* Since I made that Press statement there have been many statements in support of the claim that I made at the time, not the least by such organisations as the Life Insurance **Federation** of Australia, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and Australian Superannuation Plans.

* Before getting to the substance of what the Minister had to say in his ministerial statement about the tripartite footwear industry productivity group, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to and to congratulate the Australian Boot Trade Employees **Federation** on its centenary.

* I take the House into my confidence by stating that the State secretary in 1969 was my campaign manager when I came into this place, so I have a very warm affection for the Boot Trade Employees **Federation**.

* Australia today is entering an era of development which was never envisaged when the first settlement took place less than two centuries ago, and which was not fully realised even at the time of **federation** 72 years ago.

* Going back even further, Corowa, which is not far from Albury, was where one of the major meetings which was held which led to **Federation** and to the formation of the Federal Parliament in which we sit.

* Since **Federation** only minor changes have been made, but this Bill completely changes it to such a degree that many country divisions Wi lose their effective voice in this Parliament.

* 1 am sure that the present Government again will be negotiating successfully with the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and no doubt wheat growers will benefit as a result.

* I believe that the introduction of a proposal put forward by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** a few months ago to increase the overall Australian quota to 407 million bushels, which has been accepted by the Commonwealth Government, is a sound and responsible decision.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** over the years has taken many responsible decisions and there has been a certain amount of criticism that the Commonwealth was not prepared to go along with the Board's first recommendations.

* Overseas shipments were affected to a limited extent by bans on Greek vessels and a Waterside Workers' **Federation** strike.

* The Treasurer in a speech to the Co-operative **Federation** of Australia on 25 August last said: 
I am a bit concerned about whether the Government has heeded the advice that has been given to it by organisations involved in the building industry.

* The survey was done in co-operation with the Master Builders **Federation** of Australia and the Australian **Federation** of Construction Contractors.

* Elections involving the Australian Railways Union were estimated to cost $40,248, elections involving the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** were estimated to cost $34,643, and elections involving the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union were estimated to cost $22,195.

* It is unique in its effectiveness to the Australian **Federation**.

* I point out to the House that this Government has taken more policy initiatives designed to divide the people of Australia against themselves than any government possibly since **Federation** and certainly in modern times.

* Because of its peculiarity in respect of community of interest, remoteness, distance to travel, etc., the Division of Darling has been accepted by all parties since **Federation** as one which will be small by comparison with other electorates.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** commented on the pre-school situation in the Australian Capital Territory.

* The **Federation** mentioned a pre-school mobile travelling unit and pre-school education for physically handicapped children in the 
I suggest that the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  was attempting to make political capital out of a deep human tragedy.

* I remind him that this Government has done more for handicapped children than has any other government since **Federation**.

* After all, whether it was right or wrong, the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** was the first to make a move in this direction.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** has the backing of the industry as a whole in trying to find some formula whereby we can discourage people from disposing of their wheat across the border.

* The **Federation** has been doing everything possible but as yet has not been able to find the answer.

* It is quite clear also that he has been relying on leaks, or 'discussions' I suppose might be a better expression- half baked discussions- that he has had with a member of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots whom everyone in this House would know about, particularly his political leanings.

* Extraordinarily enough the typing error was not picked up even by Captain Smithwell who was the  President  of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots and who approved the Press release.

* I did not issue the Press release until it had been approved by the **Federation**.

* In the first 20 years of **Federation** the Parliament met for more than 100 days on four occasions.

* It refers to a demand by the Australian **Federation** of Airline Pilots that all pilot vacancies in Qantas be filled from within Australia.

* The **Federation**'s move stemmed mainly from suggestions that Qantas may recruit overseas some of the 44 pilots it needed this year.

* This was one of the points made by Qantas in its conference with the **Federation**.

* Discussions about the administrative arrangements have been held between Australian Government officials and the Australian **Federation** of Credit Union Leagues Limited.

* The **Federation** was invited to attend the discussions as it could represent the great majority of credit unions and credit union members.

* It is something that the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia does not tolerate.

* It is something for which the Waterside Workers **Federation** fought very hard.

* Although there has been some disputation and argument between the Waterside Workers **Federation** and other unions which come into contact with it in relation to work that is done in or around the stevedoring industry, the extension of the conciliation procedures as set up by  Mr Justice  Robinson may be of some assistance.

* These are the rates which were recommended by the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and they are designed to ensure that the Corporation can carry out its operations without relying on other measures.

* These rates may be varied by regulation after taking into account any recommendation made to the Minister by the Corporation after consultation with the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and any other organisation that the Minister considers appropriate.

* The legislation provides that the levy is payable by the producer of the milk or cream as the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** believes that as its incidence will inevitably be passed back to the producer it should be clearly identified as a producer levy.

* I was responsible in the first instance for taking up with the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs the question of  Mr Salemi's  readmission to Australia after he had been out here at the special invitation of the Italian **Federation** of Migrant Workers and Their Families, known as FILEF, had gone back home and then had come back again.

* It is important in a **federation** such as ours with vast areas and with population spread mainly on the seaboard with a sparse scattering through the interior that transport have a very strong voice in the economic management of the country.

* Transport planning and transport expenditure ought to have a major priority in any **federation**.

* The integration that I mentioned earlier of transport expenditure is a vital issue so far as our **Federation** is concerned.

* It is a letter from the acting  chairman  of the State Fruit Board of Tasmania,  Mr Clark,  to the secretary of the Hobart branch of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, which appeared in the 'Australian' last week.

* Mr Clark  went on to express his appreciation in writing to the Waterside Workers **Federation** for its co-operation.

* I pay special tribute to the local members of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** for their magnificent achievement.

* There was a demarcation issue between the Hospital Employees Union and the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**, all members of which are employed under the Mental Hospital Employees State Award.

* But the Hospital Employees Union was aggrieved when a female employee of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** was appointed as a charge nurse.

* The possibilities of any further development of stations' activities in this regard has been under discussion by the Board with the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters.

* The Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act gives legislative effect to an agreement entered into by the National Stevedoring Industry Conference on which were represented stevedoring employers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Department of Labour and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority.

* They are: The high cost on the waterfront, the cost plus position, the financial indebtedness of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the excessive cost of idle time and the featherbedding which presently obtains, surplus labour on the waterfront, the indulgent nature of conditions throughout the industry, the level of industrial unrest, the influence of overseas shippers - I put that on the record - the capacity of the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour to negotiate agreements borne of cynical exploitation of monopoly power without a sense of concern for the public interest.

* I go on record in this debate as saying that the Waterside Workers **Federation** is completely pathetic and its sense of ignorance of the public interest is exceeded by only one other group, and that is the employers, for whom I have the same sense of pathos because of their incapacity to stand up and be counted on very real issues.

* My Government will also introduce legislation, in support of legislation by State Governments, in order  to  make fully effective the wheat delivery quota plan of the Australian Wheat Growers' **Federation**; and to give the Australian Wheat Board discretionary powers to sell wheat in Australia, for other than human consumption, at concessional prices.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal waters as they existed at **Federation**, it has sovereign rights in this area.

* The Wheat Growers **Federation** met over in Western Australia and decided on the quota system, but the motions that gave legislative authority to the quotas did not come into this House.

* Although the working conditions for members of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia have changed because of technology still there are methods used in the loading of ships which vigilance officers of the Waterside Workers **Federation** are fearful of and believe will cause loss of life or limb.

* One of the arguments of the Opposition that I have noticed from a reading of such material is that the Senate is a States House at the moment and has been so since **federation**.

* Of course, I point out that the 1897 Convention was one of the conventions that led up to **federation**.

* The situation at **federation** was that the founding fathers did not debar anybody from being represented in the Senate.

* I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that during the recess the Principal Parliamentary Reporter,  Mr W.  J. Bridgman, retired after giving nearly 4 1 years of service to  Hansard-  more than half the period since **Federation**.

* Many problems and disadvantages in this broad aspect of welfare remain- I believe that it is tremendously important to talk about broad aspects of welfare in debates such as this- but I am confident that this Government is the first government since **Federation** which is genuinely trying to do something for the welfare problems in country areas.

* Immediately after the war we had the communist dominated unions - the Seamen's Union, the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the railways unions that tied up our transport situation.

* The proposed increase in postal and telephone charges is a direct attack on policies which have endured since **Federation**.

* To give powers by the Constitution which were given in the Constitution at **Federation** is to pretend that the Australian people do not understand and are foolish.

* I believe that we want to be a **federation**; that the Northern Territory should advance to statehood and arrive at a position where is becomes a State as an equal partner in our **Federation**.

* This country has achieved greater uniformity in expenditure, in standards and in services than has any other **federation** in the world.

* He will be disappointed to learn that the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia, the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Miners **Federation** also have not yet sent me telegrams of protest.

* 1 ) How many amalgamations of local government have occurred since **Federation**.

* The Minister saw fit to criticise the type of industrial agreement that has just been negotiated and has been overwhelmingly endorsed by a democratic vote of the whole of the membership of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* In support of that one would need to go no further than to refer to the total membership of the **Federation**.

* From 1963, when the first of the unit vessels started to arrive on the coast, if my memory serves me correctly, until this point of time the membership of the **Federation** dropped from 26,000 odd to 16,000.

* In accordance with its established practice, this Government consulted with the Australian Wool Growers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** before it introduced the wool support scheme.

* The results of inquiries so far ordered by the Government may never be released to the organisations caring for the aged or to spokesmen for the aged such as the Australian Pensioners **Federation**, or for that matter to the general Australian community, who after all supply the funds.

* I make some reference to the important submission of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia because I believe that is the major union of the industry.

* Quite recently the general secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation**,  Mr Townsend,  and its South Australian research officer,  Mr Len  Hatch, addressed a meeting at which they put forward concrete and constructive proposals about the back-up structural adjustment programs which will be needed to give the employees in the industry the confidence required.

* The Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** in its submission to the Industries Assistance Commission drew attention to industrial disputes which take place in the motor industry in Australia when compared with most other advanced countries.

* Moreover, if the decision is correct, doubts exist whether regulations made over many years, and perhaps dating back to **Federation**, under Commonwealth Acts are in operation.

* The Bill also makes provision for regulations to impose any lower rate of tax, than 15c per tonne, after consideration by the Governor-General of a report to the Minister for Primary Industry by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The measure implements the proposals of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* In line with the recommendation of the **Federation**, it is envisaged that following the passage of the Act, regulations would be prescribed to set the operative rate of levy at 11c per tonne on deliveries to the Board commencing with the 1973-74 season.

* Incidentally, this meeting was held in the Waterside Workers **Federation** building on 12th March and was attended by the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham).

* I do not believe that there are Communists in the true sense in every second bench on the Opposition side, but I believe that honourable members opposite are continually associating with Communists, The  Chairman  of the Committee to which I referred is  Mr Phil  O'Brien, a member of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Redical  left-wing students and the Brisbane branch of the Waterside Workers **Federation** yesterday openly defied Queensland Trades and Labour Council  president (Mr J. Egerton)  to take their place in the annual Labor Day march through the city.

* I can personally vouch for the fact that several years ago, members of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia who were between the ages of 60 and 65 were paid out of the industry with a payment of 70 per cent of the wages they would have earned if they had stayed in the industry until they reached 65 years of age.

* Last week I met a delegation from the National Conference of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**.

* I exclude the people associated with the Builders Labourers **Federation** and similar organisations that cannot be tolerated in any society which regards itself as a democracy and which places power in the hands of the Government to take action against conduct contrary to the best interests of the country.

* The Government is to be congratulated on being the first Federal Government since **Federation** to attack tax avoidance genuinely.

* The Liberal-Country Party Government spent more money on water conservation in its first 3 years in office than the Labor Party had spent on water conservation since **federation**.

* I envisage that a national memorial would contain also the remains of the early explorers such as Blaxland, Lawson, perhaps even Wentworth, if the present honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  would allow us to have him there, Hume, Hovell, Sturt and many others; the fathers of **Federation** such as Parkes, Forrest, Barton; outstanding military leaders such as General Monash and  Sir Thomas  Blarney; and of course all Victoria Cross winners of the past and the present.

* This special category, I understand, was introduced at the request of the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**.

* I understand that the **Federation** has complimented the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  for acceding to that request.

* Neither does it not stop me from saying that bodies such as the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** should engage in more open debate on their views rather than relying on political leverage to have their policies implemented by governments.

* It is only in the Australian **federation** that one would ever use the word 'city' as a synonym for 'State capital'.

* In the American **federation** and in the Canadian **federation** one does not have this colonial definition of city' as a State capital.

* The levy for which the Bill provides has been requested by those people who will pay the levy, that is, the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council, the Meat and Allied Trades **Federation** and the Australian Meatworks Federal Council.

* The Consumers Association in Britain and the Consumer **Federation** of America are just 2 examples of private groups which have been successful.

* We will develop a policy which is in keeping with the spirit of the **Federation** of States within the Commonwealth.

* He is the  president  or secretary of the New Settlers **Federation**.

* That newspaper also published an advertisement attributed to the New Settlers **Federation** calling upon illegal migrants to contact a  Mr Lianos  if they wanted to stay in Australia.

* We intended right from the beginning- I am now in a position to make the announcement publicly- to set up a tripartite committee in every State consisting of a representative of the Trades and Labour Council, a representative of the employers **federation** and a representative of my Department, which will act as an overseeing committee - 
GMH makes the claim that the proposal will generate 3,000 jobs directly and a further 4,000 jobs indirectly.

* The **Federation** of Automotive Parts Manufacturers estimates that there will be a 5 per cent reduction in the local content.

* You are advised that the matter has been raised with our fraternal organisation in Great Britain with the request that it be widely publicised in that country and that it be also raised with the International Metal Workers' **Federation** as a question of denial of social justice.

* This was a dinner connected with the formal opening of the Central Industrial Secretariat for the purpose of amalgamating 2 employer bodies - the Employers **Federation** and the Chamber of Manufactures - to co-ordinate their industrial relations policies.

* He said: 
It is right that we should draw the attention of the Australian people to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition led the most disastrous government that this country has had since **Federation**.

* We opposed it even before the maps were presented because the ground rules had been changed unfairly for the first time since **federation**.

* It is a seat which has existed since **Federation** and is a complete community of interest, so much so that the electors signed a petition which is now incorporated in the report of the Distribution Commissioners.

* As honourable members will know, the history of **Federation** in Australia had a rather tortuous path to follow during the late 1890s.

* It was decided to recommend to the Imperial Parliament that Australia become a Commonwealth, a **federation** of States.

* Responsibilities of local government during the 70 years since **Federation** have changed a great deal.

* -Just to put the record straight I want to quote from page 586 of the Hansard report of evidence given before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Prices where I asked the  President  of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**,  Mr Douglas  Campbell, this question: 
An unqualified 'yes'.

* That proposal was enshrined in the **Federation**'s submission to the Government.

* The machinery of this situation would be that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** would examine the matter and write a report to the Minister for Primary Industry who would examine the recommendation and then take the matter to the GovernorGeneral.

* If the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** wanted to reduce the operative levy, the same thing would apply but the contribution of the Australian Government would be reduced.

* Honourable members can appreciate that the Minister for Primary Industry cannot reduce or increase the operative levy unless he has a recommendation from the Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The Australian Commercial Pig Producers' **Federation**, the organisation which represents pig producers in all States, has requested an increase in the slaughter levy in order to provide the necessary funds.

* Australian Commercial Pig Producers' **Federation**, one marketing specialist and one Government representative.

* Honourable members will recall that on that occasion I stated that the conference was of historic significance as it was the first occasion since **Federation** that similar committees from parliaments throughout Australia had gathered together to discuss mutual problems.

* We recognise that some argument can be made in favour of it, but we think on balance that the method of listing the candidates alphabetically which is in operation at present -it has been in operation, as far as I know, since the beginning of the **Federation**- is the best method and ought to be retained.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) On 6th April 1972 the  President,  Australian Road **Federation**, requested my consideration of the Federations programme as outlined in the October/December 1971 issue of its Journal 'Road News.

* The **Federation**'s views are being taken into account in the examination of the effectiveness of the current Act and will be included in the Commonwealth's future consideration of financial assistance to the States for roads.

* Can he give details of (a) Federal and (b) State government actions which, since **Federation**, have (i) increased and (ii) decreased the size of Aboriginal reserves in Australia, including in the answer the dates of the actions, the amendments to areas of reserves and a note on whether Aborigines rights on resrved land were restricted in any way.

* I for one find it inviting in terms of contemplation to look a century ahead when the United Kingdom may find itself by that time in some Heath Robinson like **federation** in Europe- a component in a European **federation**.

* I find it strange that this country should in that sense be bound legally to a component in that **federation**.

* The **federation** of Europe is a remarkable movement.

* Speaking in this House in 1967 at the dispatch box, close now to the elbow of my friend the honourable and learned Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby), His  Honour Justice Bowen in a ministerial statement which was the commencing movement now to be culminated in this Bill said: 
My Government are astonished at attitude of  Mr Deakin  at Colonial banquet, and they are in favour of inclusion of your amendment re Privy Council in **Federation** Bill.

* This section when originally inserted in the Commonwealth Constitution provided that for the first 10 years of **Federation** or until Parliament otherwise provides the Commonwealth could give financial assistance to the States on such terms and conditions as might be provided.

* The obvious thrust of section 96 was that the Commonwealth could come to the help of the States for the first 10 years after **Federation** or until Parliament otherwise provided.

* It is wholly consonant with the compact that was made between the Australian States when **Federation** occurred in 1901.

* When that **Federation** occurred a balance- at times we have seen historically an extremely delicate balance- of power was established between the new Federal Government and the various State governments of the Australian Commonwealth.

* In return there was an implicit understanding, written as far as possible into the Constitution of Australia, that in no circumstances would that delicate balance of power between the Federal government and the State governments be disturbed except by the consent not only of the majority of the Australian people but also by the consent of the majority of the States which formed that **Federation** and entered into that compact.

* At no stage during the **Federation** debates was it ever intended that the Constitution of Australia should be altered in any way other than by the referendum procedure laid down in the Constitution and which we all understand so very wen.

* **Federation** of Western Australia, approximately 120 schools affiliated; the Parents and Friends **Federation** of South Australia, approximately 120 schools affiliated; the Victorian **Federation** of Catholic Mothers' Clubs, 190 schools affiliated; the Parents and Friends **Federation** of Victoria, approximately 125 schools affiliated: the **Federation** of Parents and Friends of the Catholic Schools of Tasmania, 48 schools affiliated: and the Association for Educational Freedom which is well known from the Goulburn schools closure days, operating mainly in the country areas of New South Wales but now mainly a research body.

* The Council has liaison with the Parents and Friends **Federation** of Queensland, with which 190 schools are affiliated.

* Let me read to the Committee what the Credit Union **Federation** says quite clearly about the matter.

* It states: 
At no time has the **Federation** indicated to the Government that credit unions have any intention or desire to enter substantially into the long term housing loan field.

* The **Federation**, therefore, seeks complete and unconditional recognition of credit unions under the Homes Savings Grant Act.

* This Committee is a nonstatutory body comprised of 4 representatives each from the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation** and an independent Chairman.

* Should an approach be made by the industry's federal organisation- the Australian Commercial Pig Producers* **Federation** - this will be given consideration.

* The Builders Labourers **Federation** has been deregistered as a result of industrial problems.

* The only thing the Government has ever said about disputes involving the Builders Labourers **Federation** has been in condemnation of the Master Builders **Federation** and it has attempted to bring down every penalty in the world on the master builders.

* But an independent judgment has been given on the activities of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* The Builders Labourers **Federation** has since indicated that it will use guerrilla tactics to reopen and to break its present agreement and to get improved conditions.

* In this situation we find the Minister for Labor and Immigration, the Prime Minister and others willing to condemn air hostesses but not the AMWU and John Halfpenny and not the Builders Labourers **Federation** for what they might want to do in terms of guerrilla tactics and industrial anarchy right around Australia.

* That this House condemns the black-mailing statements of the Secretary, Builders Labourers **Federation**, Norm Gallagher, who has publicly stated that the Builders Labourers **Federation** has black-banned work of various shopping complexes in Victoria unless contractors agree to pay all workers on the site $2 1 per week over the award.

* It is the opinion of the House that the Government should appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the activities of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* She has been incarcerated against her will by an act of violence the equal of which surely this country has not witnessed since **Federation**.

* Is  it this union - that is, the Waterside Workers **Federation** - which has the record achievement of more lost time through strike action than all other unions in Australia combined?

* Has the Waterside Workers' **Federation** refused to turn around ships in Australian ports, apparently on the ground that their seamen have remuneration and conditions less than those set by the International Transport Workers' **Federation**.

* Can he also say whether these stoppages are part of a campaign to raise the level of wages and conditions of seamen engaged on ships of various nationalities, until they reach a standard acceptable to the Waterside Workers' **Federation**.

* Having served in this House for 20 years and 3 months, I can say with all sincerity that Fred has done more to bring about the standards of services and conditions that are now enjoyed by every member of this House and of the Senate, particularly back bench members, than has any other Minister since **Federation**.

* 1 of the Penal Code of the Russian **Federation**.

* 1 of the Penal Code of the Russian **Federation**.

* I refer to a statement attributed to  Mr Des  Foster, the Federal Director of the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters, who said: 
Honourable members know that under the agreement arrived at last year the cost of the golden handshake, assuming that these redundant workers could be retired, would be approximately the same figure - $3,000 - but that this would be a once and for all payment.

* The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority has the right to declare an employee to be redundant in the main ports only if it gets the recommendation from either the Waterside Workers **Federation** or the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour.

* As the honourable member for Berowra quite rightly pointed out, this step is not likely to be recommended by the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the real guts of the problem is that the employers of waterfront labour are rather indifferent.

* One fundamental reason why there is such a large number of redundant waterside workers on the waterfront is that the Waterside Workers **Federation** will not apply to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority for them to be made redundant, nor will the employers of waterfront labour.

* The honourable member for Berowra pointed out today that the short term solution would be to ask the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to have the sole right to declare waterside workers redundant and not  to  pass the responsibility over to the Waterside Workers **Federation** or to the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, for reasons that I have mentioned.

* The honourable member for Wills said what the Government should have done, but may I remind him that over the last few years the Government has done more to assist in the field of Aboriginal welfare than has any other government since **federation**; it does not have a bad record.

* No government since **Federation** has done more than this Government has done over the last  3  or  4  years, nor will any government do more in the future.

* Let us remember that those redistributions were made under the terms and conditions which have stood the test of time since **Federation**, until the Labor Party came into power and decided to alter the conditions and the criteria so that it could achieve, from anyone who felt that he could comply with the conditions, a redistribution which would be helpful to the Australian Labor Party.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia is not included.

* The statement made by the Prime Minister mentioned the maritime unions alone; it did not mention the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* One of the Press reports states that the Minister for Transport has given a guarantee that the Waterside Workers **Federation** and  Mr Fitzgibbon  would not suffer any action against them as a result of indemnity payments made to  Mr Fitzgibbon  or the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Therefore it is utterly critical that there be specific mention of the Waterside Workers **Federation** in the terms of reference of the royal commission.

* **Federation** is involved, that the indemnity payments- almost $400,000 is mentioned in the newspapers in connection with the Waterside Workers **Federation**- will also be the subject of this inquiry.

* Waterside Workers **Federation** in Victoria is a communist.

* The **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations reportedly wrote to the Australian Film and Television School about a report that a member or members of the School intended to make a submission to the Tribunal in the hearings at Sydney.

* He made a fundamental error in the statement that he made to this House when he spoke about Ted Bull, who is the Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and who is a member of the Communist Party, controlling the waterfront.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** has no control over seamen.

* I think we will find that most people who get a travel agent's registration will automatically join the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents.

* Mr Robinson  of the Builders Labourers **Federation** has already been one victim in Adelaide.

* Has the Minister for Primary Industry seen statements by the General Manager of the Australian Wheat Board and by the economic adviser to the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** advocating a reduction in the official price of stockfeed wheat to 125c and 120c respectively?

* As far as the Commonwealth's role in this whole problem of surplus production of wheat is concerned, for 18 months before the Australian Wheat growers **Federation** made its decision I had been pointing out the problems that were confronting the industry and were likely to arise if we continued to have an escalation of production and difficult marketing circumstances.

* As a result of this the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** made a decision that there needed to be  some  restraints put on production.

* The **Federation** did this itself.

* But the New South Wales Employers' **Federation** says many industries just cannot find labour.

* The **federation**'s assertion is confirmed by 'The Sydney Morning Herald's' classified advertising section.

* The **Federation**'s executive director,  Mr J.

* Organisations represented at that conference included the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, the Australian Council of Employers Federations, the Australian Farmers **Federation**, the Australian Society of Accountants, the Chartered Institute of Secretaries, the Federated Taxpayers Associations of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, the Law Council of Australia and the Taxation Institute of Australia.

* Therefore it is proposed that to allow this industry to be placed on a basis which is as normal as possible the following steps are to be taken: The existing temporary legislation is to be continued until 31 December 1976; the ASIA is to continue its existing operations until 31 December 1976; arrangements will be put in hand to assist the staff of the ASIA as outlined earlier; the Stevedoring Industry Council, under the Chairmanship of  Mr Justice  Northrop, is to continue until 3 1 December 1976; the employers and the Waterside Workers **Federation** will be asked to indicate the steps being taken to reduce the existing size of the workforce; the employers and the Waterside Workers **Federation** will be required to submit for my consideration details of the arrangement proposed to deal with recruitment, redundancy and means of coping with the fluctuating labour requirements of the industry; the employers and the Waterside Workers **Federation** will be asked to evidence means of securing adequate labour allocation arrangements; satisfactory arrangements have to be determined concerning funding arrangements for the industry; proposed consultative machinery should provide details concerning effective representation of user interests, for example, the Australian Shippers Council and other relevant bodies such as the Australian Ports and Marine Association.

* Honourable members opposite may like to know that according to the TUTA annual report for 1975-76, the first year of its operations, representatives of unions such as the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Sheet Metal Workers Union, the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australia, the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Miners' **Federation**, the Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia attended TUTA courses throughout Australia.

* I can well understand that those who have hitherto relied on their own industrial experience and on the forms and machinery of their own unions, such as the shop stewards of the Australian Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and the job delegates of the Waterside Workers **Federation**- an organisation with which I have had some little experiencewill be even more disposed than they were before not to participate in an organisation which so obviously is influenced by employers and by the coalition Government.

* The Pig Industry Research Bill has been introduced at the request of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**, and as the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has indicated, the **Federation** represents by far the great majority of farmers in the industry.

* The commercial breeders felt that they should get together for the benefit of the industry, but unfortunately attempts to form a **federation** failed time and again mainly because of a clash of personalities.

* The Pig Division of the Victorian Farmers Union has been seeking a poll of producers and an alteration in the constitution of the **Federation** to allow for any member group to have the power of veto rather than to allow for decisions to be made by a simple majority.

* He said: 
The honourable member for Riverina is fully aware that all moves in relation to wheat quotas were originally suggested by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* Every proposition put forward by the **Federation** to the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  has been accepted, even the price of the first advance.

* This year the **Federation** has recommended to the Minister a total delivery for the Commonwealth of 308 million bushels.

* Let us consider its actions in the parliamentary sense since **Federation**.

* Governments of this ilk never recognised the right to employment in the early days of **Federation**.

* He is ex-vice  chairman  of the Australian Students Liberal **Federation** and a former research officer for  Senator Knight.

* In an article on the AUS in the  National Student  of October 1 978 he wrote: 
Over the past few months consultations between the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, the Australian Wheat Board and the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  have taken place on new stabilisation proposals to apply in the 1980s.

* The Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation** was surprised at  Mr Renton  's statement that 'there is a shortage of experienced and qualified people'.

* The **Federation** pointed out the distressing fact that the general insurance companies have retrenched over 430 staff in the last 6 months, most being experienced staff with long service.

* The **Federation** is also aware that more staff are to be retrenched.

* I hope Australia finally has a building befitting the aspirations of this young country and, as the major building of the capital of Australia, to cap and to seal the **federation** and the movement towards **federation** which began so long ago.

* The Bill is complementary to the Pigmeat Promotion Bill 1975 and makes provision for the increase in slaughter levy requested by the industry through the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' **Federation**.

* In this case the telegram to the Master Builders **Federation** from  Mr Gallagher  makes it perfectly plain that they will be sent bankrupt if they seek the normal protections of the due process of law which ought to be available to any person or company in Australia.

* The Attorney-General is therefore supporting the Builders Labourers **Federation**- if all the evidence I have given is correct, and I have every confidence in it- in strong arm tactics designed to terrorise major companies, designed to see that companies and individuals in Australia have no protection under the process of law if they act contrary to the wishes or desires of the Builders Labourers **Federation** or the governing hierarchy of that **Federation**.

* What a price to pay for the abandonment of a system which was worked out in 1910 and was based on very sound principles, because the founding fathers of **federation** well knew what had happened in New South Wales, of which originally this area formed a part, and the scandals associated with  Sir John  Robinson and everything that followed in that period.

* Use another one', when he knows full well that the whole experience of Australia since **Federation** is that the method that he puts forward as the one that we should try is doomed to failure.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** has proposed that there should be 3 commissioners.

* We, like the **Federation**, have insisted that at least one of those commissioners should represent the teachers, who have an important stake in the educational process.

* The  President  of the Australian Farmers **Federation**,  Mr Noel  Hogan, rightly criticised the Prime Minister for his biased attitude.

* Tax sharing is the most significant reform to Australia's system of government since **Federation**.

* They had given the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** authority to negotiate a new 5-year stabilisation and marketing plan with the new and incoming Government.

* I have completely failed to find any evidence that any industrial organisation has held a conference of growers in any State to discuss such a proposition, or that they have been given any opportunity to direct the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** on this all-important matter.

* In this situation, how can it be claimed that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** had any mandate from the growers to accept this one year proposition on their behalf?

* If the Minister is leaning on an acceptance by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, how then does this constitute his right to claim that these Bills have the support of the industry, that is, the growers?

* Is this the same group of academics who conceived the disastrous wheat quota delivery plan and sold it to the then Secretary of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** on the understanding that he would then sell it back to the Government, through the **Federation**, as the **Federation**'s own courageous plan?

* This extract contains my submission to the then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, the right honourable John McEwen, submitted in my capacity as  President  of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* **Federation** any reason to believe that the Governments required the power of direction over the Australian Wheat Board.

* The **Federation** had requested that the clauses already contained in the Legislation and giving the Minister power to veto action of the Board should be deleted, and the Board should be relieved completely of the possibility of Ministerial interference.

* To be fair we must admit that at no time did the Minister give the **Federation** any reason to believe that he was prepared to delete these clauses.

* The **Federation** views with most serious concern and disappointment, the action of the Commonwealth Government in making what we consider to be a fundamental change in the measure of control assumed by the Crown over the marketing of wheat, as compared with that applying when the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act 1946 had application, and because the change holds much menace to the principle of private ownership of the produce of the land, and the principle of the farmers' right to market their own produce.

* This **Federation** believes that it is essential to the future conduct of the Board, that the Board must be fully protected from what may be termed " back door pressures."

* This **Federation** learned with utter dismay, that whilst ballots were being taken on the amended plan, no mention was made that such a sweeping change was contemplated over the marketing of the produce of our land.

* The Minister told the **Federation** that the clauses were inserted in the legislation with his full knowledge and he would accept full responsibility for them.

* He offered the **Federation** no hope that the clauses would be deleted and gave no indication that the alternative assurances requested would be granted.

* Minister in my capacity as President of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, and nearly 20 years for the proof to emerge as to the real need to ensure that the Australian Wheat Board is free to act on the basis of trusteeship for the growers free from Ministerial interference of any sort, my stand has not changed one iota.

* Furthermore the Chrysler company warned the executive of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** of Australia - one of the two unions involved - that if it endorsed a ban on their work it would stand down sections of the Lonsdale plant and other lay offs would take place at the plant at Tonsley Park.

* With the lay offs at General Motors-Holden's the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** and the Amalgamated Engineering Union have sought to have the matter brought on as a matter of urgency.

* The Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** Federal Council met in Adelaide this week.

* the principal objection is to the constitution of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation** rather than to the legislation and to research itself.

* is whether the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**- is constituted with an equitable base for all State organisations.

* However, I am advised that the **Federation** has put forward this scheme.

* The **Federation** is the only federal organisation of the pig industry and it is representative of producers in all States, although not necessarily all producers in all States.

* Petitions have been important from **Federation**.

* Two appointees will be those recommended by the Australian Teachers' **Federation**.

* The idea is to have it inscribed so that the Teachers' **Federation** will have the mandatory right to ensure that it will have representation on the Schools Commission.

* The Opposition sticks very rigidly to the position that it is far better, in the long term interests of education, to require that the members of the schools commission - the principle of which the Opposition accepts - be appointed as a result of mandatory guidelines written into the legislation to ensure that the Commission includes representatives of the States school systems, education research, the independent school system and the Teachers **Federation** - indeed all of those interested groups that are in fact involved in education.

* I would strongly refute that there  has  been any political pressure exerted on the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, whether before the implementation of, quotas or since their introduction.

* **Federation** that all State grower organisations agreed to it.

* At recent meetings in November and January the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** reaffirmed its support of the quota system and rejected the suggestion that an advance should be paid on overquota wheat.

* The **Federation** feared that unless this was done the stabilisation plan as we know it could be completely wrecked.

* It has been against this background that we have seen a very responsible stance taken by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, with the Minister for Primary Industry and the Government straining every sinew and muscle to try to help the industry lo meet the situation.

* The warning was issued by the  president  of the Australian **Federation** of Construction Contractors,  Mr C.  Sexton, who said the Government failed to understand the importance of the industry in the economy.

* It is no wonder the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and other organisations are accusing the Government publicly of hypocrisy.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Cattlemen's Union want absolute acquisition powers and the Australian National Cattlemen's Council and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council want commercial autonomy but have reservations about acquisition.

* Several years ago, the Meat and Allied Trades **Federation** attempted to promote the sale of sweet meats, previously described as offal.

* I would like now to refer to the fact that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** represents the vast majority of Australian wheat growers and has a long and very creditable record of dedicated and highly efficient service to the benefit of all Australian wheat growers.

* I therefore urge the Government to take cognisance of the requests made by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, which represents the growers, to ensure that as far as possible the viability of the industry is maintained.

* A good deal of work has been done by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** in many ways to try to make things a little easier for the wheat growers whom it serves.

* At the 106th Australian Agricultural Council meeting held in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 29 and 30 January this year the following resolution in respect of trading on the domestic market was passed: 
Discussions with representatives of the Wheatgrowers **Federation** and the Wheat Board have revealed that they are prepared to give sympathetic consideration to any problem that may arise whereby assistance may be required in special cases in which it could be desirable that agents other than the Wheat Board operate on the domestic market.

* The Board and the **Federation** do not have a closed door on that at all.

* The Bill seeks to facilitate an agreement reached by the Fremantle Port Authority and the Waterside Workers **Federation** and it is a matter which has the support of the Stevedoring Industry Council.

* It concerns approximately 30 members of the Waterside Workers **Federation** currently employed by the Fremantle Port Authority as crane drivers.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** 
The most significant union in the industry is the Waterside Workers **Federation**, whose members provide the bulk of the manpower for stevedoring operations.

* Participants were the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Labour and National Service.

* The pig industry through its Federal organisation, the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**, approached the Government and requested the introduction of the research scheme for their industry.

* The **Federation** is comprised of 6 State councils.

* Through the membership of the pig producer and breeder bodies who form these councils, the **Federation** represents by far the great majority of farmers in this industry.

* It now has a national voice, the **Federation**.

* One of the first actions of the **Federation** was to seek this research scheme thereby bringing the pig industry into line with the advantages enjoyed by other livestock industries.

* Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**, 2 from the Australian Agricultural Council and 1 each representing the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, universities and the Department of Primary Industry.

* That means that we have had only 8 redistributions in the 76 years since **Federation**.

* The attitude of the Government to the activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* More importantly, why has the method of the operation of this House barely changed from **Federation**.

* The Commission is a successful and highly respected body which has done much to improve the American **Federation**.

* He opposed the Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Wool Commission and all the other woolgrower and farmer organisations.

* In fact, he was a little concerned that I should even mention the State from which he came because builders are concerned about retaliation from unions such as the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* We have found that the additional cost to the taxpayer as a direct result of industrial disputation by the Builders Labourers **Federation** alone is $2m, which gives the House and the people of Australia some idea of what the activities of this union and of some others like it are costing the country.

* We hope that none of these actions will be necessary, but we do hope that someone in the Builders Labourers **Federation** - 
I want to make one reference to a case in the United States of America.

* It has been part of the Australian scene in one form or another almost since **Federation**.

* What should astonish honourable members opposite and the public in general is that in 1901 - that was at **federation** - Australia's population stood at 3.75 million.

* When he says that the Australian Labor Party is dedicated to the destruction of the federal system or of **federation**, obviously he has not read our policy, which provides for decentralised control and social control.

* That is why I asked in my question on notice what this Government will do in response to the call from the International Planned Parenthood **Federation**.

* Yet the Builders Labourers **Federation** Executive kept workers off 22 building sites, after the men voted to return to work.

* In other words, the Builders Labourers **Federation** Executive wanted the best of both worlds.

* The fact that some of these strikes were not part of the green bans emphasises how political was the motive of the Builders Labourers **Federation** 'Executive.

* I point out that we live in a **federation**.

* But it is very difficult for a nation to have coherent energy policies, particularly for a **federation**, if some parts of that **federation** are negligent in the way in which they handle the situation within their own States.

* This immediately makes one quite pale with anxiety because those of us who have studied the industry know the fundamental problem that has dogged the industry is that the agreements, the sweetheart agreements as they are called by honourable members opposite- I used to call them that- that have been forced on the shipowners through the monopoly power of the Waterside Workers **Federation** have encouraged the cost escalation, the cost plus sytem, on the waterfront.

* We have to get rid of this position on the waterfront now where the chap who is a member of the Waterside Workers **Federation** has certainty of employment until he dies, unless he is bought out with a golden handshake, which is the envy of all the community.

* It is with a feeling of utter thankfulness that I find that the industry seems to be facing up to its problems both on the Waterside Workers **Federation** side and on the shipowners' side.

* On 9 June 1977, in the case of Johns v Allen and others the applicant sought orders under section 141 that a person purportedly elected to the office of 'organiser' in the Geelong sub-branch of the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation** not be treated as holding office on the grounds that the rules made no provision for such office.

* How ridiculous it is to consider that some 70 years after **Federation** we still have people believing that they have to adopt a defensive attitude against every decision that the Commonwealth wishes to make.

* The situation has been pointed up by a meeting some weeks ago called by the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** at which the following resolution was passed: 
Let me make the one final point that was put to me in a letter from the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** which applied to the Canberra Hospital.

* Mr Hogan,  the chief in the Australian Farmers **Federation**, last week expressed deep concern on behalf of his organisation at the Opposition's move.

* At the time of the change in government the Australian Wheat **Federation** had already initiated discussions with the preceding Government to devise ways and means by which the 5-year stabilisation scheme could be renewed.

* It is commendable that there should be discussions between the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation** and the Government to determine what the new wheat stabilisation scheme should be.

* The average length of service in this House since **Federation** has been just under 10 years.

* The recent Waterside Workers **Federation** agreement is another classic example.

* When I say that organisations of employees or of employers are in many ways not subject to rules that carry consequences, let me refer briefly to the activities of the Builders Labourers **Federation** about 4 months ago.

* In a telegram received by  Mr J.  Jorgensen of the Master Builders **Federation** on 4 September this year the Secretary of the Australian 
Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation** set out the conditions which will apply to the building industry.

* The second paragraph of the telegram, which has been incorporated in Hansard, reads: 
I refer to the findings of the Australian Industrial Court, which heard the case of the Master Builders **Federation** and the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation**, in which  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Joske said: 
I remind honourable members of the Fitzpatrick and Browne case in this House in 1955 in which newspaper articles were used to influence and intimidate a former honourable member for Reid.

* I believe, and I would say that the Liberal Party of Australia believes, that the laws of this country should be such that they allow all people involved in employment a fair go so that they have no hesitation in applying to a court and feel no restriction in applying to a court and they do not wish to be dominated in any way, as the Builders Labourers **Federation** portends to do in this case.

* As a member State of the **Federation** which he helped to safeguard against the constitutional violations of the previous Government, Western Australia is grateful and would welcome and honour a vice-regal visit at any time in the future.

* Secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, in a paragraph of a letter, had this to say: 
A further letter sent by that **Federation** to the editor of the Melbourne 'Age' stated in part: 
The point was made by the honourable member for Barton  (Mr Reynolds)  who preceded me in this debate that the majority of the Australian Educational Council was not in full agreement with what we seek to do.

* In the 21 November issue of the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** journal called 'Education' there appears an article which relates the experiences of members of the teaching profession and parents who came to Canberra to discuss this matter.

* They point out in their article that one member of the Australian Labor Party said that he did not think there would be any insuperable opposition to the appointment to the Schools Commission of representatives of the Australian Teachers **Federation** and the Australian Council of State School Organisations.

* In practising the principle of **federation** insofar as it leaves the right of establishing priorities to the States, this Bill leaves the Queensland Government responsible to the Queensland electorate as to whether the Bundaberg scheme should have been at the top of the water development projects in that State" required for Queensland's economic development.

* Looking again at Steam Mill Street, we find, for example, that organisations sponsoring a demonstration against the New South Wales Summary Offences Act - including the Australia Party, the Communist Party, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Builders Labourers **Federation**, George Petersen, who is a New South Wales Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly, and many other well known communist agitators - had their printing done there.

* As another example, the Australia Party joined with Workers Action, the Builders Labourers **Federation**, the Communist Party and other similarly politically motivated groups to hear George Petersen from the Australian Labor Party, Jack Mundey from the Builders Labourers **Federation**, Denise Aarons from Womens Liberation, Laurie 
As well as these communist groups supporting this printer, we also find that the New South Wales Teacher **Federation** is a great supporter of 22 Steam Mill Street.

* What is the association between the Teachers **Federation**, these other groups and DOGS?

* It seems reasonable to suggest that DOGS was set up by the left wing of the Teachers **Federation** to attract away from the Liberal-Country Party coalition people with strong sectarian or anti-state aid views.

* How is it that one printery in particular has been able to attract so much work from the Australia Party, the communist parties, the Teachers **Federation**, DOGS, the Australian Labor Party and other radical groups?

* Our legislative program in our first 2 years surpassed all records since **Federation**- 254 Bills introduced in 1973, 229 in 1974.

* As arranged several years ago with the Waterside Workers **Federation**, representing the ITF, if a request is made to augment ITF rates to bring them up to Australian rates, the amount has always been paid to the ship 'screw.

* 1 ) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a report in the  Age  on 27 October 1976 concerning the claim by the General Secretary of the Australian Teachers' **Federation** that the membership of the committee to investigate Australia's education system was stacked to provide recommendations in accord with the Government 's point of view.

* Has there been any communication between the Minister and the Australian Teachers' **Federation**.

* The Victorian Farmers Union, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, the Graziers Association and the Wool Industry Conference - none of them want a referendum on this issue.

* If the Opposition intends to regard local government authorities as the children of the State governments, then I would say that the States have been starving their children for years -in fact, since **Federation**.

* Has this man, who thinks he can run a **federation** on the basis of keeping tax money, completely forgotten his law?

* In my view the establishment of a commission with the purposes set out in this Bill will not enable the Commission to do what many like the New South Wales **Federation** of Infant School Clubs think it should do, namely 'establish a philosophy in relation to ultimate goals incorporating standards, innovations, needs and priorities in relation to families'- and I emphasise 'families'- 'and the community'.

* At its 1974-75 annual conference the New South Wales **Federation** of Infant School Clubs called upon the Government 'to ensure that no pre-school child is deprived of his or her mother's care for financial reasons, especially in the first 3 years '.

* A pluralistic approach should be followed and the Australian **Federation** of Child Care Associations and its constituent members should be given appropriate recognition and encouragement.

* 1 will quote, if I may, a comment that I noticed in a speech made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  when he opened the Australian Farmers **Federation** conference at the Hotel Canberra on 23 October.

* I do not know whether the Citrus Industry **Federation** might in time find itself in a somewhat similar position.

* It is regrettable that neither in the Leader of the Opposition nor in those who sit behind him does there seem to be any understanding of what is without doubt one of the most significant and progressive tax changes introduced in Australia since **Federation**.

* These Bills come from a proposal for an expanded oilseed research scheme which was put forward in June 1975 by the oilseeds committee of the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation**.

* It is a condemnation of our political system that those conditions do not yet exist 77 years after **Federation**.

* This is something which, under the Constitution, has been since **Federation** a State government responsibility.

* The immigration power was given to the Commonwealth at **Federation** for very good reasons, and the same considerations to which I am referring - the lack of contact at the local level, and the creation of a hospital system which is malleable and adjustable to individual circumstances and the felt needs of particular communities of people and particular areas - was one of the principal reasons why the hospital power was left with the States.

* What justification has he given for this drastic action by a Commonwealth government, this departure from a situation which has worked since **Federation**?

* Finally, has the Government received any communication from the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations indicating its total opposition to the establishment of such a school?

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Federal Government were almost in a head on conflict.

* The Conference was made up of representatives of the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia and the Department of Labour and National Service.

* One should be from the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, and one from the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The employer representatives and the union representatives at the highest level of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers **Federation** will meet regularly to discuss the problems.

* Another example is to be found in the Australian Financial Review' of 24th March, when the  president  of the Australian Road Transport **Federation** said: 
During the early 1940s, after the Treasury bench here was vacated by the political opponents of the trade union movement generally, the Stevedoring Industry Commission was set up.

* Also there were representatives of the trade union movement - namely of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* There was some difference of opinion between the government of the day and the union about the Stevedoring Industry Commission which led to the removal of the 2 representatives of the **Federation**.

* Later the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board was set up, and representation was denied to the **Federation**.

* During this, period the **Federation** was engaged in some struggles about conditions that other unionists had enjoyed and, of course, which some unionists had not enjoyed.

* This placed the **Federation**, very proudly, in the forefront as a condition winner for a number of organisations, a role which it still continues to play very admirably on behalf of the whole trade union movement.

* The **Federation** ought to be commended for adopting that line.

* Any case put forward by anyone in the industry, be it the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, which was set up in about 1956, the employer organisations, or any direct representation by the **Federation** through the Australian Council of Trade Unions which is the recognised head of the trade union movement - and these bodies met consistently - was not acceded to.

* We in the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation** were accused by almost all Government members of being led by Communists.

* Many legislative measures moved against the trade union movement in this chamber by the Government were directed against the **Federation** in the stupid and forlorn hope - the Government was misguided then; I hope that it does not continue to be misguided in the future - that such measures in fact would overcome the problems of an industry fraught with problems.

* I come lo the 1960s When the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the trade union movement on the waterfront were attacked viciously on disciplinary measures.

* The effect of the action of the Government was to unite the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation** and its members more than ever.

* We do not oppose the Bill in any way, shape or form but permit me to say, if 1 may, if the Government, in view of the increased efficiency and throughput on the waterfront today, and having regard to the shocking mistakes of the Minister for Trade and industry  (Mr McEwen)  and the **Federation** in wrapping themselves up in the containerisation programme, had had enough commonsense, decency and recognition of this, it would have removed by this Bill those lousy clauses that it was so stupid to put on the statute book in .1965. lt is never too late to hope that the Government might do this but it will not be given the opportunity.

* There are also moves within the Department of Health, at the behest of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  to end the co-operative Federal-State arrangements on animal and plant quarantine functions which have existed since **Federation** and to transfer the functions to completely Federal control.

* I am flattered to note that the parts manufacturers through their **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufacturers have now taken up this call in their qualified support for the local content changes.

* I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  and the Government have seen the sense and the wisdom of accepting an amendment which will in fact make the redistribution to be carried out in the Australian Capital Territory consistent with a policy that has obtained in Australia since **Federation**.

* It is all very well to go out and tell the people that the present system - the system that has operated since **Federation** - is wrong.

* In assessing the industry involved, I think we should also look at the union concerned- the Airline Pilots **Federation** of Australia- which in some ways is different from other unions but certainly is an industrial body intent upon assisting its members.

* The **Federation** has something like 99 per cent union membership.

* Pilots who do not wish to belong to the **Federation** can for a fee enjoy the benefits that the **Federation** acquires for them, but if they wish to refrain from membership as conscientious objectors they may do so.

* There is no compulsion to join the **Federation**, although it has something like 99 per cent membership.

* I suggest that the activities of the **Federation** and the type of structure within which it operates are reasons for its success on behalf of its membership.

* Time and again the Pilots **Federation** has said that it will not abide by the decisions of the Tribunal, and I draw from that statement the inference that the employers will not abide by them either.

* The Minister may have set out to bring the Airline Pilots **Federation** under his wing so that he can apply his will to them rather than to the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* Some persons in the gallery might wonder why in the Australian **federation** we are still struggling to implement free hospitalisation which has been available in our sister **federation** of Canada for many years.

* Under **federation** the 
Over recent years there has been an extraordinary increase in the number of small organisations having political action as their mode of expression, and the overthrow of Liberal governments as their aim.

* The various factions of the Communist Party, the Australia Party, the Australian Labor Party, the Defence of Government Schools, the Socialist Youth Alliance, Workers' Action, the Builders Labourers' **Federation**, the New South Wales Teachers' **Federation** - all these are committed to radical change of our present society and its institutions and standards.

* Looking more closely at some of the clients of 22 Steam Mill Street, we find they include the Australia Party, The Anti-State Aid DOGS, the Australian Labor Party and the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* In 3 years it has doubled the expenditure which Australia has built up in all the years since **Federation**, and that is the nature of the spendthrift Government that we have at the moment.

* Shortly after those arrests and the placing of charges I was most interested to receive a circular from the Secretary of the Builders Labourers **Federation** of New South 
A spokesman for the Premier,  Mr Wran,  who is also the Minister for Police, said later that the company and the **federation** had applied to the Acting Commissioner of Police,  Mr J.  T. Lees, for the charges to be dropped.

* He is being hotly opposed by  Mr Norm  Gallagher of the Builders Labourers **Federation**, who is aligned with the Marxist group of communists.

* When the Builders Labourers **Federation** was brought before the Industrial Court for deregistration  Mr Justice  Franki had this to say in his judgment: 
This is the type of standover tactic which these people are prepared to use.

* As the honourable member for St George said earlier today in this place, in March this year there was a disgraceful exhibition when the Builders Labourers **Federation** invaded the offices of the Building Workers Industrial Union, tossed furniture all around the place, and frightened the female staff of that office.

* There is no doubt that in a **federation** the decisions of a Commonwealth government, the governments of the States, local government authorities, semigovernmental instrumentalities and private decisions both corporate and individual have a significant effect on the way in which our urban areas develop.

* Labor has been in power for too short a period since **Federation** for this distrust to be broken.

* The Prime Minister, in his curious speech on 23 September, talked about the Commission in the United States having been of great assistance in improving the American **Federation**.

* body heard that expression before- the American **Federation**?

* As I have stated already, we have introduced personal taxation reform which is second to none in the history of the Australian **Federation**.

* I refer to the concern that is felt by the **Federation** of Australian Broadcasters, which body represents some stations which are controlled by the Party to which the honourable member belongs.

* It might be thought that the **Federation** has a specialised interest in the matter but I point out that it controls some stations which did not dissociate themselves from a resolution of the **Federation**.

* The **Federation** unanimously affirmed its determination to support the principles that the public is best served by the continuance of the freedom of the commercial broadcasting industry to program its stations in accordance with the demonstrable interests of the communities which it serves.

* That is part of the resolution passed by the **Federation**.

* The **Federation** of Australian Broadcasters would not have the power it has today.

* As honourable members may be aware, the age qualification for candidature at Federal elections has been coincidental with the minimum age for enrolment and voting since **federation** and the Government takes the view that there is no logical reason to depart from the uniform age practice under Commonwealth electoral law.

* As a matter of fact the Australian Farmers **Federation** is inclined to agree with the statements that I have made today, even though its secretary was not commenting on the same subject.

* The Melbourne 'Herald' of 8th April this year reported: 
The Secretary of the Australian Farmers **Federation**,  Mr A.  S. Norquay, today defended income tax concessions for primary producers on the eve of a 2 day meeting in Canberra.

* I should have liked him to have gone a little further on the question of **federation** and the Constitution.

* No, the question of **federation** which the honourable member for Bowman mentioned.

* It is an undeniable fact that the most important matter which is concerning all thinking Australians today is **federation** and the relationship between the Commonwealth Government and the States.

* Many people think of **federation** as one thing and the governments of the Commonwealth and the States as another thing.

* They seem to forget, of course, that **federation** is a union of the States.

* Very few people, including politicians and leaders of governments, have given much thought to the establishment and growth of **federation**, where it has led us and what should be done about it in the future.

* I think that a little thought on the development of **federation** is appropriate at this time.

* It was in this atmosphere that the great leaders of political thought realised that we must create a **federation** of States if we were ever to reach our destiny as a great nation.

* We all know of the turmoil and the difficulties experienced in bringing about **federation**, and it is interesting for everybody to read of those difficulties.

* We remember  Sir Henry  Parkes, known as the Father of **Federation**, who tried desperately to establish what he at that time called a federal council' to deal with matters of common concern to all the colonies.

* Can anyone imagine what the position would be in this country today without **federation**?

* It was inevitable that we had to have a **federation**; otherwise it would have been impossible for this country to carry on in the way that it has.

* I believe, too, in the partnership of the States and the Commonwealth in a democratic **federation** with a common objective of maintaining and developing the Australian nation.

* I know there are people who believe that, but in my opinion it would have been a retrograde step to give this power to the States and would have been inimical to the best interests of **federation**.

* That was the original concept of **federation**.

* It is in this last field of policy and activity that the bonds of true **federation** must be exerted in the national interest.

* My appeal is to the Prime Minister of Australia and to the Premiers of the States throughout the whole of the **federation**.

* This is true **federation**, not the type with which we are dealing now.

* All we require is leadership not only in the Federal sphere but also from the Premiers of the States and our State elected representatives to get together on a true basis of **federation**.

* I am sure that the Board would not hesitate to adopt this procedure if it were considered to be the best way of proceeding: As it is, the Board has met with all sections of the industry including Actors' and Announcers' Equity Association of Australia, the Australian Writers' Guild, the Producers' and Directors' Guild of Australia, the Australian Film Council, programme producers, the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations and representatives of individual stations.

* But we have to get a picture of how spending has increased gradually over the period from **Federation** until the present time.

* By 30 June 1974 total Government spending had arrived at a certain level- total Government spending built up gradually from **Federation** to 30 June 1974.

* But let me tell him something: Charlie Fitzgibbon, the Federal Secretary of the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation**, is a member of the Australian Labor Party.

* -The honourable member talked about communists controlling the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* I refer to the written promise by the present Prime Minister as given to the Australian **Federation** of Credit Unions in a letter dated 24 October 1972 which stated that a Labor government would (1) grant exemption from taxation on credit union  incomes and (2) allow child endowment, social service and repatriation payments to be credited to the savings accounts of members of credit unions.

* The **Federation** was formed in 1974 to support local Aboriginal family education centres using materials and methods originally prepared in association with the Adult Education Department of the University of Sydney.

* I noted in a book entitled 'Australia Since **Federation**' by Professor Fred Alexander, which was published in 1969, a particularly interesting exchange between a former Prime Minister,  Mr Chifley,  and one of his senior advisers.

* Yet the honourable member for Gippsland comes into this House tonight and tries to detract from what is undoubtedly a first in Australia's history since **federation**.

* We have had them since **federation**.

* At the time of **federation**, 1902, a 25 deposit was introduced.

* It was quite a lot of money in those days and certainly would have kept a lot of people from nominating 
The history of our very young **federation** bears witness to the truth of that.

* I have not checked on what happened before **Federation** but this is the first time since **Federation** that pensioners in public hospitals in Australia have had to pay for their upkeep.

* It is the first time since **Federation** that pensioners have not had free hospitalisation.

* It was the most overwhelming result in a referendum on a contentious matter in Australia since **Federation**.

* This Government has done more in 20 months for local government than any Federal Government since **federation**.

* It provided for the sum of $30m to be allocated to the constituent States of this **Federation** for sewerage works.

* It is, in the Committee's opinion, more in accord with democratic principle and the developments since **Federation** that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one-half of the number of States.

* The new family allowances are probably the most far-reaching welfare step taken by any government since **Federation**.

* If I do I will have to wait too long for an answer, ls it a fact that the Waterside Workers **Federation** has served notice on the stevedoring companies concerned that if the Government is not prepared to allow the respective stevedoring companies to honour the agreement for a 35-hour week recently reached between the **Federation** and the Australian National Line all special working agreements for ANL terminals will be cancelled as from 22nd November 1970?

* Finally, if these are facts, how does the Minister justify the Government's action in refusing to allow the respective stevedoring companies to sign the agreement reached between the Australian National Line and the Waterside Workers **Federation**?

* The statistics which are gathered by the Bureau of Statistics, or whatever source gathers them, do not include time lost through the guerilla type action which currently is being conducted in the building and construction industry by the Builders Labourers **Federation** in particular.

* In South Australia, which is the area that I know best, no work is being done on any major project and has not been done for three months as a direct result of the action of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* If the Builders Labourers **Federation** would lift its bans and discontinue its guerilla action, there would be employment opportunities for very many of the men who currently are unemployed.

* It is entirely the result of industrial action by building unions, and in particular by the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* We have a whole host of High Court cases  -  162 since **Federation** - trying to determine what the words 'conciliation' and 'arbitration' mean, and what is meant when we say 'prevention or settlement of disputes'.

* We find that industrial disputes' did not mean what the founders of this **Federation** thought the expression meant and intended it to mean but means something entirely different.

* The honourable member for Moreton was quite right, too, when he took us back to the kind of Australia that existed at the time of **Federation** when these laws were first hammered out.

* When I was reading some of its early history just the other day, I discovered that since **Federation** the number of members of parliament has increased by 63  lh  per cent, whereas the population of Australia has increased since that time by 273 per cent.

* The State Premiers and their Treasurers are still to negotiate on some of the fine points in relation to this new **federation** policy.

* We are fearful, as are many honourable members and other people within the States, that State governments have become over the years little more than expenditure agencies, little more than administrative bodies, in a way that **Federation** in this country never envisaged at all.

* During the last election campaign whenever I had the chance to put this new **federation** POliCY to areas in my electorate, people of all political colours were tremendously attracted by it.

* We have not set quotas on exports nor taxed meat exports as the Minister told the Australian Farmers **Federation** today.

* I condemn the actions of the pilots employed by Connair Pty Ltd and the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots for holding the Territory to ransom and aiming to put the whole country at a disadvantage.

* That policy has forced up the long term bond rate to 8.5 per cent - the highest rate recorded since **Federation**.

* I am advised that the Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia and the Musicians' Union of Australia are the only employee organisations which have such a requirement in their rules.

* Workers **Federation** is being confirmed two ways- by changing the title of the Division and by inserting a new section 8 1  A. 
I said earlier that we were ensuring that Division 4 of Part III of the principal Act remains the area from which the Commission draws its jurisdiction as to disputes involving the traditional area of work of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Following meetings between the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots and  Mr Connellan,  the general manager of Connair, with me on Monday, the **Federation**'s  President  Captain Smithwell, agreed to go to Alice Springs and to put certain propositions before the pilots of Connair in respect of this matter.

* I understand further that there have been only one or two casual conversations, not by Captain Smithwell himself, but apparently by the industrial officer of the **Federation** with one or two pilots throughout the Territory.

* As  Mr Connellan  pointed out to the **Federation** the cost of the strike to Connair will be in the region of $160,000.

* I am quite sure that the **federation** has not placed the facts clearly and properly before the pilots in the Northern Territory as it promised me it would do.

* That revolves around the gross misrepresentation undertaken by the Minister and by other members of the Government as well as by the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** and by advertisements that have been placed in newspapers over the last week which have utterly distorted in the most plain and blatant manner views that have been expressed from this side of ths House and now expressed this afternoon in the Senate, when every person in this House has voted to support certain legislation and the expenditure of $694m precisely as the Minister and the Government would want.

* We are fortunate that the Builders Labourers **Federation** has acted in Sydney with social responsibility in this area by putting an embargo on certain redevelopment projects within the city of Sydney.

* The **Federation**'s motive behind this action has been to conserve some of Sydney's historic sites and to maintain the basic character of the Sydney area.

* -Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of a statement that Tasmania would be better in Canada under the Canadian system of **federation**?

* Indeed, instead of promoting the substance of change towards a republic of which even the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to his discredit has spoken, I believe that this Bill will preserve the monarchy and ensure that through the GovernorGeneral there is continued opportunity for us to preserve a system that is written into our Constitution and which so effectively has protected the rights of every citizen of this country though the years since **Federation**.

* As the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations claims that surveys show adult and peer behaviour is the main influence inducing children to smoke, will the Minister arrange for his Department to undertake or sponsor a similar survey to fmd what influences adults and children to stop smoking, or collate and publish existing findings on this subject.

* As the **Federation** further claims that cigarette consumption rose after a ban on television advertising when advertising expenditure in other media rose, will the Minister publish especially findings which refer to other advertising media.

* Will the Minister also publish replies to the 15 questions, quoted in the **Federation**'s last annual report, from the United States House of Representatives.

* My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations, concerns the industrial campaign being waged by the Builders Labourers **Federation** in Victoria and South Australia for an over-award payment of $2 1 a week.

* Is the Minister aware of Press reports this morning that negotiations were about to commence between building employers and building unions, and later reports that these negotiations had broken down, with the Builders Labourers **Federation** imposing work bans on building sites in Victoria and South Australia?

* A major purpose of **Federation** was to create a national economy.

* That is the objective of **Federation**.

* This is the achievement of the most reactionary Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  since **Federation**.

* Mr Whitlam has posed the greatest threat to parliamentary democracy since the beginning of **Federation** by saying- 

 Mr Whitlam has posed the greatest threat to parliamentary democracy since the beginning of **Federation** by saying he will govern without the Parliament.

* Appropriation Bills have never been rejected in the history of the **Federation**.

* He is doubtless aware that the Australian Olympic **Federation** is to decide in the next few weeks on the anthem or song for the Montreal Olympic Games.

* Is the Prime Minister aware of reports that the Australian Olympic **Federation** favours  Waltzing Matilda!

* Presently the interest rates in Australia are the highest since **federation** 74 years ago.

* In 1975 Malcolm Fraser led the coalition Parties into the greatest victory of any government since **Federation**.

* After two years in office he then led our Parties to the second greatest victory of any government since **Federation**.

* A statement in the Melbourne  Sun  yesterday by  Mr Ian  Spicer, the Secretary of the Victorian Employers **Federation**, is worthy of note.

* When he tried to make a case about 1,000 unemployed he began by mentioning 560 married women teachers whom the Government of New South Wales does not regard as being other than casual and not under any obligation to employ but whom the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** regards the Government as being under an obligation to employ.

* The Upper House was a concession to induce the colonies to accept **federation**.

* This was to protect the small States against what could be the machinations of the large States in the House of 
We are reinforced in our request for the establishment of this select committee by the attitude of the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* I feel that the **Federation** should support the amendment that I have moved on behalf of the Opposition to have a select committee appointed to hear and to evaluate its complaints.

* But not only is the **Federation** of Commercial Television Stations critical of the conditions of its licences and the conditions applied to its members; the Australian Broadcasting Control Board time after time, year after year in its annual reports is also critical of broadcasting stations and television stations.

* I have referred so far to the general complaints of the **Federation** of Commercial Television Stations and some of the comments of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in its last annual report.

* My second reason for branding this Bill as a thimble and pea act is the proposal to deny the request by the Australian **Federation** of Credit Union Leagues for the inclusion of credit unions as approved institutions under the homes savings grant scheme.

* The Government had no consultation with the Australian **Federation** of Credit Union Leagues prior to the drafting of this legislation, nor did it consider the New South Wales legislation which sets out the conditions under which credit unions may function.

* He said: 
The **Federation** is of the view that a serious national problem exists in the level of residential land prices.

* We have been subjected to a tirade of abuse and to assertions that the Government has not done enough and that after 69 years of **federation** we are still without water.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings For all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with Australian Council of Trade Unions policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* The initial proposals for this levy were submitted by the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council and fully supported by the Meat and Allied Trades **Federation** and the Australian Meatworks Federal Council.

* He has come, as you  Mr Speaker  have indicated, from a family which has traditionally served this Parliament and the people of Australia from the beginning of **Federation** in 1901.

* Other steps taken by the Labor Government to assist the needs of primary producers include: The provision of emergency adjustment assistance to farmers producing export apples and pears and apricots following revaluation of the Australian dollar on 23 December 1972; an extension for a further year of the wheat stabilisation scheme to allow a comprehensive review to be undertaken in conjunction with the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**; the provision of a special incentive of 10c per bushel to be added to the usual first advance payment of $1.10 per bushel for wheat harvest and the recent from the 1973-74 wheat harvest and the recent decision to reduce tariffs by 25 per cent will be particularly beneficial to the rural sector and substantially effect the cost of many farm requirements.

* No Australian government and certainly no Minister for Defence has been responsible since **Federation** in this country for providing so many opportunities in terms of professional service, and this has been done in the brief space of 10 months.

* It needs to be understood that this **federation** is a compact between six States.

* The States entered into the **federation** under certain terms and circumstances.

* The history of this country shows that since **federation** 70 years ago some wonderful men, by their wisdom and by what they did in this House, did much to build this nation.

* With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard a table showing the representation of the Australian Labor Party in Parliament since **federation**.

* Australia became a **federation** almost  70  years ago and since then the Australian Labor Party has occupied the treasury bench for only  16  years and  3  months.

* The third principle is that in a **federation** an effective system cannot be worked out without co-operation between State and Federal governments.

* I rise tonight to seek Federal Government support for the Victorian State Government in its bid through the Australian Olympic **Federation** to the International Olympic Council for the 1988 Olympic Games.

* At the risk of repeating myself, 1 must refer to a document which was brought out by the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots which examined various aspects of Qantas Airways Ltd, including future prospects concerning retrenchments and the world market.

* In this document the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots says: 
Many people of our own acquaintance these days travel on the normal air routes only as far as Singapore and then take charter flights at least as far as Brussels and sometimes into Gatwick or even into Heath Row if they are going to the United Kingdom.

* The fourth difficulty mentioned by the **Federation** concerned the increase in seat capacity.

* Of course, the Builders Labourers **Federation**, under  Mr Mundey,  a well known communist, will no doubt dictate what is to be built and where it is to be built - it is doing that at the present time.

* There has been a refusal to recognise the constitutional right and position of the Senate; a refusal to recognise that Australia is a **federation** and despite the best efforts of this Government will remain a **federation**.

* He is painfully learning the fact that Australia is a **federation** with a distribution of powers appropriate to a **federation**.

* A. S. Norquay, Secretary, Australian Farmers' **Federation**, Letter, 15 April 
Advises support of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* John Bennett, President, Australian Dairy Farmer's **Federation**, Telegram, 18 April.

* It is appropriate to recall that the Founding Fathers envisaged the future progress of the 6 States of Australia as along the course to a strong, independent, national outlook and possibly to the creation of more States within the **federation** as the population grew.

* I suppose it is understandable that in the years since **Federation** constituent States should tend towards State parochialism, but that in no way excuses the paranoia of the present non-Labor Premiers whose policies and endeavours fly in the face of the development of a strong, independent, national outlook.

* Subsequently, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, at its conference in May 1974, adopted unanimously the following resolution, following the discussion paper on the adverse effects of State regulation in transport industries: 
Clearly at the time of **Federation** there was a distribution of power, but as time has advanced that distribution or allocation of responsibility is not now as appropriate as it was.

* The cooperation between the 3 spheres of government in the **Federation** has developed through the years in a haphazard fashion.

* The Commonwealth is also playing its part by giving local government a real voice on this Council, which, in the development of government in this country, will be one of the most significant ventures ever undertaken since **Federation**.

* That the current Waterside Workers **Federation** strike had its origin in the strike by electricians and mechanical engineering fitters at Seatainer Terminals and Liner Services Ltd Melbourne.

* The punting game has been going on since **Federation**.

* This was made very clear by the pensioners in the resolution of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** Conference in May of this year.

* I want to make it clear that the pensioners' views have not changed as a result of the proposals now before us and I quote from the letter sent to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  by the **Federation** on 27th August of this year.

* It said: 
On behalf of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation** this **Federation** condemns the failure of your Government in the 1971-72 Budget to pay due regard to humane and social values ...

* This **Federation** calls for an immediate examination of the whole Australian Social Service structure and the appointment of a Committee to carry out a full scale public inquiry into providing a more humane and equitable pensions system.

* The employers application to the High Court for a writ of prohibition and moving for de-registration of the New South Wales Branch in the State jurisdiction is a clear indication  that employers are deliberately setting out on a course of confrontation designed to provoke and destroy the Builders' Labourers **Federation**.

* A telegram enclosing that resolution was sent to  Mr Jorgensen  of the Master Builders **Federation** on 4 September 1974.

* On that day, or the next day  Mr Gallagher,  general secretary of the Australian Building Construction Employees **Federation** asked Walter John Glover, industrial officer of the Master Builders **Federation**, what the High Court writs were all about.

* The attitude of the Government was that the matter had nothing to do with it and that the Builders Labourers **Federation** was as free as a breeze.

* That is what the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in the course of his address this morning 
The Builders Labourers **Federation** was deregistered on about 2 1 June of this year as a result of a long period of disruption and unlawful activities in relation to the building industry.

* In relation to a demolition operation involving  Mr Pringle,  the **Federation**'s New South Wales Branch  President,  and  Mr Mundey,  he reported: 
At the next page of the judgment  Mr Owens,  Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the **Federation** is referred to.

* A number of unionists in the Builders Labourers **Federation** served an urgency log through  Mr Gallagher  to try to get back into the Arbitration Commission to have their case heard even though they were deregistered.

* This brings me to a telegram that was sent by  Mr Gallagher,  the Secretary of the **Federation**, to  Mr Jorgensen  of the Master Builders **Federation**.

* It states: 
The committee represents these unions: Australian Workers Union, Federated Clerks, Queensland State Service, Teachers, Clothing and Allied Trades, Shop Assistants, Commercial Travellers, Royal Australian Nursing **Federation**, Queensland Railway Salaried Officers, Railway Traffic Station Masters, and Railway Signalmen.

* The purpose of the Opposition's policy in federalism is to repair the **Federation** and to bring back a little bit of sanity and co-operation into it 
It seems to be impossible for any level of government these days to achieve co-operation.

* It means a **federation**.

* There was an occasion last year when the Builders Labourers **Federation** delivered threats against builders that if they proceeded with a matter in the High Court the **Federation** would create industrial trouble.

* He, above all people, should know that the implementation of the quota system, which was recommended by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and which was accepted by this Government, was a matter for the States.

* While it would probably have been easier for all if this quota system could have been implemented earlier, I point out that it was implemented at the time that was suggested by the growers themselves through their own Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** has aimed at this objective.

* I give great credit to the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** for the courage it showed in bringing down this policy of quotas to restrict production.

* This was an honest attempt by the **Federation** to deal with the situation as fairly and reasonably as possible.

* I want to commend the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** again because this body realised that there was a shortfall in the amount of prime hard wheat which might have been able to be exported this year.

* It was a good thing also that we had in the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** men of similar calibre.

* I am very proud that the  President  of the **Federation**,  Mr Les  Price, is a fellow Queenslander.

* As Senior Vice-Pres dent he contributed very considerably to the sound policy that was recommended lo the Government by the **Federation**.

* Mr Speaker, I have left unsaid so much that would be so worthy of mention on this occasion, but if what I have said has served to convey to this House and to the people of Australia something of the problems and something of the very courageous and effective way in which they have been handled by this Government and by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, these remarks will have served their purpose as well perhaps as a longer oration might have done.

* I want to quote from a statement attributed to a  Mr K.  McDougall, the then  president  of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The first 2 sentences of that report stated: 
On 13th March, the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** decided to restrict the production of wheat in Australia.

* Of course the initiative was taken by the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation**, which is a very responsible body.

* The Minister for Primary Industry has said on numerous occasions that the initiative was taken by the **Federation**.

* In this instance, of course, it is the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation**.

* As a Victorian, naturally I am not satisfied with the quantity of wheat that the **Federation** allocated to Victoria.

* There will be absolutely no room for complacency in the Labor movement as we go about dismantling this Government which, in our opinion, is as bad as any Liberal-Country Party government since **Federation**.

* If the Australian Workers Union, the Metal Workers Union or the Waterside Workers **Federation** make a political donationand usually such a donation would go to the Labor Party- that donation is always made public.

* The Australian people in their colonies and since **Federation** as well have accepted 'God Save the Queen' for 200 years.

* For some time there have been difficulties associated with this fund, and these difficulties were brought to the attention of the previous Government by the parties most crucially involved, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* He threatened that the Government would be giving close attention to the performance of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Shipowners, employers of waterside labour and the Waterside Workers **Federation** all expressed the view that the levy should be higher than that proposed by the Government at the time.

* Evidence exists that there was redundant labour at ports and that the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the employer groups were anxious to solve that problem.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry aware of reports in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' and the Melbourne 'Sun' today indicating that the  President  of the Australian Farmers **Federation** has criticised the Australian Country 
Professor R. H. Thorp, representative on Council of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations (Chairman).

* I do not mind the Prime Minister being somewhat proud that he is a member from New South Wales- the most populous State, as he described it on this occasion and as he has described it on many occasions with some relish- but may I, as a representative of one of the other States, draw to his attention that when this **Federation** was formed a condition on which the other States came into it and on which it was founded was that they would have an equal say in the Senate.

* As I said, in the 1890s some of the selfgoverning States, when considering **federation**, were not prepared to come into the **Federation** unless their position was safeguarded.

* That, of course, runs completely counter to the basis of our **federation** and to the structure that I have briefly outlined in my remarks.

* At the time of **Federation** the law of bankruptcy was thought to be of such national importance that it should be within the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament.

* I discussed the role of advisory bodies and how they had developed since shortly after **Federation**.

* The Government has before it a submission from the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* These factors will be taken into account most sympathetically in consideration of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** submission.

* It is the first time since **Federation** that pensioners will be charged for being in a hospital when they are declared nursing home patients.

* We also know that the key unions in this country, such as the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Seamen's Union, the railway unions, the miners, the Building Workers Industrial Union and the Builders Labourers **Federation** are communist controlled or strongly communist influenced.

* Teachers **Federation**.

* Is it a fact that one of the Bills now before the House, namely the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill, will take sovereignty from the States in certain areas that are now shown on Commonwealth produced maps as State territory - that is, areas acquired by the States since **federation** by reclamation, port or harbour development or any enlargement of internal waters as a result of the 1958 convention on the continental shelf?

* I have some doubt about that, because yesterday 1 received a letter from a single pensioner referring to this campaign and to the Pensioners' **Federation** and the plight of single pensioners.

* The writer says in her letter: 
That is the Pensioners' **Federation** -   .

* But the Pensioners* **Federation** never included such things in their curriculum- 
As one with some wide experience in the stevedoring industry which the Minister regards as having been extremely turbulent for many years, I can say to the Minister that he will never cure the problems of this industry by imposing pains and penalties.

* The union was a Commonwealth wide **federation** and the legislation made provision for one of the State branches of that union to opt out of the **federation** and shelter itself under the wing of the Department of Labour and National Service.

* He presided over the most dishonest government since **Federation**.

* The big argument, the big contest, in this country concerns **Federation**, whereby the State governments have the title to the land, can extract some royalty and can give away some of the assets at prices which are not fair or reasonable.

* I feel very strongly because the matter has been brought to my attention by the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** whose members naturally enough feel very strongly about this matter and regard such announcements by Australian Prime Ministers with some significance.

* 1 ) Did he state to the Australian Road Transport **Federation** on 17 September 1979 that many persons and organisations in the road transport business were genuinely concerned at the Government's policies in general areas as well as those specifically directed at transport.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with Australian Council of Trade Unions policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* As most members of this Parliament are aware, there has been an enormous increase in the use of technology in Australia since **Federation**.

* There has been a mammoth increase in productivity in the Commonwealth Public Service during the period since **Federation**.

* These men and women are much more highly trained than were their predecessors, those who were employed at the time of **Federation**.

* In spite of all these changes which have occurred since **Federation** successive Liberal Party-Country Party governments have refused to increase the period of annual leave for public servants.

* The next meeting of the International **Federation** on Voluntary Health Service Funds is to be held in Chicago, United States of America, in August 1970.

* It takes more in all taxes, both direct and indirect, than any other government since **Federation** at the turn of the century.

* The International **Federation** of Airline pilots and its various branches - the American Airlines Pilots Association, the British Airline Pilots Association and our own people here in Australia - have been talking about imposing an embargo on flying aircraft to any country which does not penalise a hijacker.

* If ah aircraft is being flown from one country to another that is not prepared to observe the terms and principles of the Tokyo Convention and to penalise those people who hijack aircraft, I agree that the International **Federation** of Airline Pilots should say: That country is out.

* It is interesting to note what  Mr J.  Mundey, New South Wales Secretary of the Builders Labourers **Federation** and a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party of Australia has to say on this subject.

* I am equally sure that anyone who has the interests of the 3 levels of government in the **Federation** at heart will look forward with very great interest to the Grants Commission's Reports on its inquiries into the financial needs of local governing bodies.

* Previous Australian Labor Party governments- I know that there have not been many since **Federation**- have all accepted the previous criteria of the electoral laws.

* At the time of **Federation** the 20 per cent tolerance was written into the law and has been accepted by all governments until the Whitlam Government came forward with a Minister who is absolutely obsessed with the electoral laws and the electoral system and who has tried to change them and manipulate them for his own party political advantage.

* At the meeting referred to on 23 February 1974, representatives of 27 consumer groups agreed to establish an Australian **Federation** of Consumer Groups, and elected a steering committee to draft a constitution for further consideration.

* The proposed **Federation** will be an independent body and the Australian Government's chief role in relation to it will be in consulting it on matters of interest to consumers.

* At the appropriate time, the Government will consider the possibility of providing some financial assistance to the **Federation**.

* I expect the question of a permanent executive for the **Federation** will be a matter for the **Federation** to consider after it has been formed.

* David Bowman entered Parliament in 1899, the year the Parliament of the colony of Queensland debated the **Federation** Enabling Bill.

* Almost three-quarters of a century has passed since the debate, to which I have referred, on the adoption of the Constitution and the resulting **federation** of the 6 independent colonies.

* Today in accepting that role I ask honourable members to reflect for a few moments on the years since David Bowman, his colleagues in the Queensland Parliament and their counterparts in the parliaments of the other colonies debated the proposed **federation**.

* Often their interests and utterances and those of their State governments clearly indicate that **federation** is still a partially unacceptable concept.

* This Constitution which suited the **federation** of 6 independent colonies 70 years ago, which suited the growth and development of those colonies into States of the Commonwealth, no longer adequately suits the new visions and new concepts which we must adopt to permit our nation to face the next century, to provide for our future generations and for the role we must fill in this south east Asian section of our globe.

* Dairy Corporation, the Milk Equalisation Committee and the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and representatives of various manufacturing interests, both proprietary and cooperative.

* The views of the union most directly involved - the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** - deserve consideration.

* The  President  wrote to me saying she had been instructed by her council to voice strong opposition to the proposed Medical Practice Clarification Bill and affirmed, inter alia: 
What the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** Branch here in Canberra, which is facing the possibility that the Medical Practice Clarification Bill might become an Act, says confirms experience overseas.

* The Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** does not have to speculate on the consequences of the proposed Medical Practice Clarification Bill.

* However, it is true, as the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson)  stated in his second reading speech, that the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation** has moved that these measures be taken.

* The initiative came from that **Federation**.

* In order to face these circumstances the Government, at the request of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' **Federation**, has agreed that additional money should be spent on research and promotion.

* We are concerned, to echo the words of  Mr D.  Campbell, who is currently the  President  of the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' **Federation**, to ensure that if Aus.tralian farmers are to be able to continue to improve their genetic material, if they are to match the products of the larger companies, there is -research into improving pig genetics.

* As a further illustration of the fact that it was never intended by the founders of **federation** that a Territory should be represented by senators I again draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the debate of the 1897 convention on this very point.

* If that be the case and if it is today essentially a Parties House then what the Government is doing is seeking to turn its entire back on the nature of the compact as established at **Federation**.

* We believe that in a federal system an income tax is most easily and most equitably applied at one level; mat it does not lend itself to division according to the different levels of the **federation** because of the disparity in respect of resources; and that it is part of the job of a federal mechanism to equal se the differences.

* The Australian Farmers **Federation** led by  Mr Noel  Hogan, who is a distinguished resident of my electorate of Riverina, and its secretary,  Mr Norquay,  who has been there for a generation, the United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association of New South Wales and the Victorian.

* But take the case of a corporation or a body that is not incorporated, for example, a trade union movement, or, if honourable members like, the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* The State cancer organisations subscribe to a national **federation** - the Australian Cancer Society - which has limited funds for the purpose of co-ordinating the State activities and endowing certain national research programs.

* The Westminster system of government which has served this nation well since **Federation** just cannot endure if a de facto second government, not elected by the people as the Government, but self-appointed, seeks to operate in the Senate.

* This constitutional convention has been clearly recognised and has been unbroken in Australian Federal politics since **Federation**.

* These include the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and the Federal Dairy Council.

* Producer membership of these bodies is decided by the Minister from among persons whose names have been submitted to him by the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** or by another relevant organisation of dairy farmers.

* Of the three producer representatives of the Australian Dairy Produce Board two were appointed on the nomination of the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and one on the nomination of the Federal Dairy Council.

* Of the four producer representatives on the Dairying Research Committee the three members representing dairy farmers engaged in the production of wholemilk for use in the manufacture of dairy products were appointed on the nomination of the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**.

* The member representing dairy fanners engaged in the production of wholemilk for human consumption was appointed on the nomination of the Milk Producers' Association of Australia and New Zealand and the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**.

* Now, apparently with the agreement of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers **Federation** reached at a meeting held in Sydney, where the representatives of the proper port authorities most intimately concerned and the representatives of the State governments intimately concerned were not present, the old system has apparently been condemned and, implicitly, support has been given to the changed levy system which the AEWL has introduced.

* The same article contains a statement by the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots which was strongly critical of Qantas management.

* The article said: 
The **Federation** said it was surprising and curious that at the end of last year Qantas was seeking to add to their pilot strength from overseas sources.

* The **Federation** said Qantas management had informed it mat the first indications of a likely recession came in December.

* The **Federation** said the Qantas reasons for the recession were hardly valid when the company had not pursued in a businesslike manner the overseas market 
Apparently the **Federation** had not gazed intently enough into the crystal ball.

* The article continued: 
-This legislation was introduced following a request from the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** through its oilseeds committee.

* I feel that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** through its oilseeds committee deserves great credit for bringing this proposal forward.

* The **Federation** did not ask for Government assistance.

* I refute any criticism of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The industry and the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** deserve credit for making the approach in the first place.

* Then came the Builders Labourers **Federation**- 
Mir McLEAY  -  Thank you,  Mr Deputy Chairman.

* I wish to place on record the composition of this committee because it includes delegates from the Australian Metal Workers Union, the Builders Labourers **Federation**- 
It is the same part.

* I have already identified the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** sent delegates to the 35- Hour Week Committee- 
The authority of the Department of Transport is derived from the Air Navigation Orders designed by the Department of Civil Aviation.

* The manual which is recognised by the Department of Transport is that of the Australian Parachute **Federation**.

* That manual enables the **Federation** to ground persons who do not observe certain safety standards.

* But my grievance today is not with the deficiencies in the Department of Transport's regulations so much as with the failure of the departmental officer to ensure that the manual is enforced, even if the enforcement agency is not the Department but the Australian Parachute **Federation**.

* My information from skilled parachutists is that the manual of the **Federation** is comprehensive and that if it were enforced it would be sufficient to prevent accidents.

* The manual of the Australian Parachute **Federation** contains the following operational regulations: 5.3.19 No alcoholic liquids shall be in evidence on the drop zone or emplaning area while parachuting operations are in progress.

* The major incident report of the Australian Parachute **Federation** in relation to the double fatality of 29 December 1974 records the grim facts.

* I am informed that the  President  of the Australian Parachute **Federation** made it clear that the **Federation** could not enforce regulations regarding the intake of alcohol.

* Therefore, the Department of Transport must do it for the **Federation**.

* The Australian Parachute **Federation** has failed to enforce its own regulations.

* Let me remind the House that the Liberal members of that committee were 2 Senate Ministers, our High Commissioner in London - the son of one of the Founding Fathers of **Federation** - and  Mr Justice  Joske.

* **Federation** and it will be acting to defend the sovereign rights of the States.

* It was his Government's objective to get more funds into the project, he said after a 30-minute meeting with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Road Transport **Federation**.

* I quote the views of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** which referred to the Government's position in the last Budget in these terms: 
1 ) Has the New South Wales Aboriginal Family Education Centres **Federation** informed the Regional Director (Eastern), Department of Aboriginal Affairs, that it decided on 6 April 1 978 to refuse Federal funding for the last quarter of 1978-79.

* Has the **Federation** been an autonomous allAboriginal self-help movement since 1969 emphasising aboriginality and family education especially for infants and their parents, run mainly by people supporting themselves by taking menial contract work despite having done special training at Sydney University.

* Did the **Federation** complain that the sub-total public funding support given did not warrant the time required for continually repeated explanations to a succession of junior officials of what they were doing and why they did not want to be a pre-school.

* The reason simply is that the new federalism policy has put more money into the pockets of the State Premiers than anything since **Federation**.

* Much has been said in the past year about the working of our **Federation**.

* May I suggest that the very magnitude of the provision we are making in this Budget for additional payments to the States is proof of our real desire to ensure effective working of the **Federation**.

* This is a field in which, with the complexities of government at the moment, there is need for a conference whereby there can be discussion of how we can make the **Federation** in which we live work more effectively.

* There have been cases involving the Hospital Employees **Federation** of Australia, No.

* There have been cases involving several members of the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* It requires careful consideration to ensure that the measure is appropriate to our **federation** and the proper protection of our environment.

* To some students of constitutional law that may seem at first strange, but of course in the books there is some support for the view that because on **Federation** there was created a nation, out of that nation there springs implied power to do certain things.

* A few years ago members of the Builders Labourers **Federation** charged into the Australian Labor Party conference and beat people up.

* We saw what happened when the Builders Labourers **Federation** got into an argument and invaded the Building Workers Industrial Union premises in Sydney, and eventually had to pay damages for what occurred.

* I can see that people who work as labourers in a winery will be entitled to join either the Australian Workers Union, the Liquor and Allied Trades Union, the Miscellaneous Workers Union or perhaps even the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* In an address to the American **Federation** of Labour Convention in September 1952.

* In fact, one often reflects that perhaps **federation** came too soon.

* If that does occur, I suppose I will be very disappointed, but what is far more important than that is the fact that the Wimmera electorate has been in existence since **Federation**.

* There have been further eulogistic remarks in support of the Bill from the New South Wales **Federation** of Infants School Clubs, the **Federation** of Parents and Citizens Associations of New South Wales and the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* I think the Australian Teachers **Federation** also has expressed its admiration for the Bill.

* In fact, the  President  of the Australian Teachers **Federation** is one of the persons to be appointed by the Government as a member of the Commission.

* For instance, one entitled 'Big Catholic Parent Group Backs Minister' states: 
The Australian Logging **Federation** made some useful observations about the escalation of operating costs that are reflected in comments I have made elsewhere in this report.

* The Opposition supports this Bill which arises from the amalgamation of the North Australian Workers Union and the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia and for arrangements made, in consequence of that amalgamation, for the Waterside Workers **Federation** to take over the activities in the Port of Darwin.

* Now that the workers who would formerly have been members of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union are members of the Waterside Workers **Federation** and are part of the stevedoring industry it has become necessary to make consequential amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Act so that these workers will attract the full benefits of the legislation.

* For many years the honourable member was a high executive officer of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* It is a great pity that those of us who serve in this Parliament have allowed it to degenerate into the worst Parliament since **Federation**.

* For instance, the Manager of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots,  Mr Coysh-  in case there is lack of knowledge of the matter by the public I point out that he is not a pilot himself, but a paid industrial officer- has made claims about the alleged breakdown of navigational aid facilities and used the Department's notices to airmen system, known as NOTAMS, to try to demonstrate his point.

* The Minister for Transport,  Mr Peter  Nixon, said this evening he had made a thorough investigation of all the allegations made by  Mr Coysh  of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots concerning aviation safety yesterday.

* It is the most imaginative proposal since **Federation**.

* For example I have before me a letter on the subject from the  President  of the South Bulli Miners Lodge, a letter from the Secretary of the Stanwell Park Country Women's Association pleading for assistance for these people, a letter from the Appin Miners' **Federation** signed by its  President,  a letter from the  President  of the Stanwell Park Parents and Citizens Association and a letter from the Secretary of the Bulli Miners Lodge.

* **Federation** have supported the AEWL.

* The first discussion between the Australian Government arid the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents on the licensing of travel agents took place in January 1971.

* The industry agreed that there was a need for Federal legislation and talks had been held with the industry, the industry being represented by the Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents, the international airlines, the overseas shipping companies and the Australian National Travel Association.

* I am assured that the following organisations from the travel industry support the introduction of uniform travel agents legislation: The Australian **Federation** of Travel Agents, the Australian Road Transport **Federation**, the Australian Hotels Association, the Motor Inn and Motel Association of Australia, MFAHomestead and many others.

* We feel, as an Opposition, it would have been far preferable to give us a federal court that was dealing with all federal jurisdiction and not leave it in a situation which obviously had to develop at the time of **federation** that State courts would be exercising Federal jurisdiction.

* Now we have grown up as a **federation** we say that the situation is not as it was when that jurisdiction was vested in the State courts.

* The deal- let us face it- was simply this: Some of the colonies were not prepared to enter into the **Federation** unless their position was safeguarded.

* I think that there is a greater sensitivity today in the States, no matter what kidney of government may preside over them, concerning their respective positions than there was in the 1890s held by the colonies as they then were-they did not become States until they entered the **Federation**.

* That seems to me to be a pretty reasonable charter in the running of a **Federation**.

* I come from the State which was, in the words of  Sir Edward  Braddon back in 1901, 'the most loyal and steadfast in supporting the cause of **Federation**'.

* Despite its size Tasmania in fact was, if I might say so, the most driving force in the birth of **Federation**.

* I believe that the economic policies of the new Government are good and sound, that the wheels of private enterprise will start turning again and that Tasmania will at least reach the equality it deserves as an equal partner in the **Federation**.

* No doubt pressure from the large open funds and the employers **federation** deleted these suggestions.

* In respect to pilots, the Australian **Federation** of Airline Pilots could be brought within the provisions of the Act.

* One cannot consider it without taking into account the future of the Northern Territory in the whole Australian complex, in the Australian **federation**.

* I mentioned earlier that the television stations, through their organisation, the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations, had waged an elaborate, expensive and factually inaccurate campaign which culminated in the production of a glossy magazine that purported to answer the critics' charges that they were not fulfilling their moral obligations to Australia's cultural heritage.

* I accept that the States have enormous problems, but I think that the question ultimately is one of how **federation** will work and how we as representatives of the people of Australia - not just the executive government - feel that this country should be run in the future.

* The constitutional balance of legislative authority and administrative function in the Australian **Federation** is to be deliberately distorted without the approval of the people, notwithstanding the repetition of mystical invocations by the advisers to the GovernorGeneral of the 'national will', the 'will of the people', and a somehow perceived 'instruction from the people'.

* A national identity and the national co-operation of all the peoples of a country which has such a great and abiding future can be forged and achieved once it is acknowledged that within the Australian **federation** States and their governments are a system of representative regional government as capable of discerning and expressing the regional will of its people as this Government claims for itself over the national will of the nation.

* (a) The strike in November-December 1966 which was called by the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots arose out of claims for salary increases, the formulation of a comprehensive form of contract slating in full all the responsibilities and rights of pilots and the introduction of a formula pay system in line with that already agreed with the domestic airlines.

* Strike action was resorted to when the **Federation** of Air Pilots rejected an offer by Qantas of salary increases to pilots which was subject to the **Federation** agreeing to accept that the pilot crew of aircraft engaged on trans-Tasman operations should be reduced from three to two and for **Federation** members to conduct night landings into Djakarta.

* If I may say so with respect to him, it was an unfortunate attack because the judiciary, of course, cannot protect itself from such attacks, which have been traditional in the Parliament over the years since **Federation**.

* The **Federation** of Australian Radio Broadcasters was most critical of what was going on because it wants to have this power in the hands of the Minister so that the Ansetts, the Murdochs and those people can bring pressure to bear.

* Instead it compounded them and the people poured such scorn upon it as has never been seen in our 75 years of **federation**.

* There was then the historical squabble, about the time of **Federation**, as to where the national capital should be.

* There are some who sit in the State parliaments and some indeed who sit in this Parliament who want to refight the battle of **federation**.

* But the colonies became the States under the compact of **federation**.

* I would like to see a close co-operation developed between the Children's Commission, the Schools Commission, the Department of Education, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations so that a concerted effort can be made to bring parents advice on the child raising process.

* Let me put this proposition to the House: If at the time of **Federation** in the 1890s the proposal had been that a simple majority of electors voting at a referendum would be adequate means of altering the Constitution, the **Federation** would never have come into existence.

* At that time there were no States in existence; they were colonies and they became States when they entered the **Federation**.

* But the fact remains - this is the historic base from which we must consider this question - that **Federation** would never have been brought into being if there had been a simple deal to have 3 States or to have a majority simpliciter of electors voting.

* Those who founded the **Federation** said that there shall be four States in favour.

* I do not wish to embarrass my distinguished and gallant friend from Isaacs  (Mr Hamer),  but he was saying to me before this debate started that at the time of **Federation** it was in the minds of those who attended the convention that new States would be created.

* On 14 April the  Australian  newspaper reported a statement by the manager of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* In that article the **Federation** was reported as claiming that cost cutting and staff shortages were dangerously eroding air safety standards.

* The manager of the **Federation** went on to list items involved and the locations where this was happening.

* He said, in part: 
The Minister responded to that serious statement by a major union in the industry in his usual inimitable way, namely, by denying the claims of the **Federation** and accusing its manager,  Mr Coysh,  of casting aspersions on fellow members of the **Federation** and air traffic control personnel.

* Does the honourable member think that the Builders Labourers **Federation** does it?

* Might I take the last sentiments expressed by the honourable gentleman when he was referring to the agreement made between the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the shipping companies.

* Let me take the case  .if  the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the shipping companies.

* I have given the illustration of the agreement between the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the shipping companies.

* There was consultation with the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* My Department and I regarded it as appropriate that the Australian Teachers **Federation** be the co-ordinating authority for its own constituent parts.

* The New South Wales Teachers **Federation** and the Australian Capital Territory Branch of that **Federation** are of course parts of the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* After a change in office bearers in the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**, when objec tions to our speaking directly with the AusSouth Wales Teachers **Federation** had been removed, we did have extensive discussions with that branch, I think to the advantage of both parties as became evident in a Press statement which appeared in the Canberra Times' as a result of the discussions.

* At the express request of the Australian Teachers **Federation**, meeting their wishes, we have provided that teachers wishing to appeal against determinations of the Commissioner will appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and not to the Public Service Arbitrator.

* This was done at the request of the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* Indeed, looking through the correspondence received from the Australian Teachers **Federation** on 8th February and the matters which the **Federation** put to us, it is clear that that body wanted a 3-man commission and not a commissioner.

* The letter from the **Federation** also referred to additional minor penalties which it felt should be introduced into the legislation.

* I think that was all the **Federation** had to say about penalties.

* I write to thank you for the consideration and hospitality extended to me and the other Australian Teachers **Federation** representatives during our visit to Canberra at the beginning of this week.

* David Hunt is  President  of the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* I wish to mention a few matters - iri detail, I am afraid - in respect of discussions I had with the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* As a result of our discussions I think the representatives of the **Federation** felt happier about some aspects of the legislation.

* The **Federation** raised, as other people did, the question of a commission rather than a commissioner.

* This view was confirmed in a letter from the Australian Teachers **Federation** dated 8th February 1972.

* The remarks of the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory do not seem to lie well beside those views expressed by the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* Under this Act local government, for the first time since **Federation**, is given the opportunity to influence the Australian Government in its financial allocations.

* I am not talking on behalf of just the Building Workers Industrial Union or the Builders Labourers **Federation**.

* Perhaps the 
Translation of the material issued by the ACT Teachers' **Federation** was not considered to be a function of the Translation Unit.

* The Canadian **Federation** of Humane Societies is invited to, and does, provide a representative on each assessment panel.

* Time does not permit me to quote in detail from this excellent document but I pay tribute to that body and the work done by its  president,  Wayne Reid, its Secretary, Garry Daly and its committee, particularly  Mr Les  Martyn, the  President  of the Australian Amateur Weightlifting **Federation**.

* In short, interest rates are now at their highest level since **Federation**.

* We believe that the Government stands condemned for imposing on the Australian community the highest and most onerous interest rates since **Federation**.

* Only last week in Victoria the Builders' Labourers **Federation** rejected an incredibly generous offer made by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and said that its members would stay on strike.

* It commenced in 1975, following a request from the industry through the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation** for this promotion.

* He told us that the request for the increases had been made through the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation**.

* His  greatest drawback was that he belonged to the worst political party we have had since **Federation**.

* It reads: 
The initiative which the Government is now taking is the most significant step taken in the field of industrial relations since **Federation**.

* This was the price of **Federation** and it was a price which we agreed to pay and, having agreed to pay, we will of course go on paying.

* While one would accept the principle of inequity in the representation of the small States as part of the price of the **Federation** contract and honour the contract which has been entered into, I see no reason why, when there is no constitutional need for us to do so, we should import this principle of tremendous inequity into the Senate.

* Going back to the time of **Federation**, the conservatives of this country have had 6 or 7 different names.

* 'President Australian Amateur Gymnastic Union, delegate to Australian Olympic **Federation**.

* : former President of Australian Sports Medicine **Federation**: involved with scientific sports coaching: N.S.W.

* : Vice Chairman Australian Olympic **Federation**: General Manager I960 Australian Olympic team: chairman National Fitness Council of N.S.W.

* Solicitor, senior partner legal firm Australian fencing representative at 3 Olympic Games, silver medallist 1962 Commonwealth Games: President Australian Fencing **Federation**: Chairman of the Oceania Fencing **Federation**: acting Chairman of the British Commonwealth Fencing Association: Vice Chairman of N.S.W.

* on the Australian Olympic **Federation**.

* Recreation supervisor, City of Melbourne: General Manager 2 Olympic teams: Secretary Australian Olympic **Federation**: various other administrative positions: several sports, especially athletics.

* Indeed, the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** recognised this, and it was with this in mind that the **Federation** recommended the introduction of quotas, and quotas have now been a fact for some years.

* These sales are part of the reason why this year the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, in looking at expected crop yields and expected domestic demand, was able to say: 'We believe there is justification for making some slight increase in quotas.'

* It was on the **Federation**'s recommendation that the Government decided that there should be the payment of the normal $1.10 per bushel as a first payment on the delivery of the higher quota of 339 million bushels of wheat.

* Mr L.  V. Price, who is the  President  of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, is quoted in today's Melbourne 'Herald' as saying he believes that because of the increased demand to which 1 have referred the quota increases were justified, and he says he believes that there is a prospect of a Chinese contact this year.

* I  conclude my remarks by reading part of  a  letter which was sent today to all hon ourable members from Victoria by  Mrs Margaret  Gartland, the Secretary of the Parents and Friends **Federation** of Victoria.

* The letter reads in part: 
The **Federation** is therefore launching a campaign for a new Education Act.

* I believe that the Parents and Friends **Federation** of Victoria has set out sound proposals in this letter and after listening to the various Opposition speakers today neither I nor the electors are quite sure what Labor's policy on education really is.

* When I was Secretary of the AWU Jim Healy and Roch, the gentlemen to whom the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  presented the  Illawarra Star Cup  way back in the good old days, came to see me to point out that AWU members handling cargo and shipments of various kinds at Whyalla ought to have been covered by the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia because the workers could get some quite extraordinarily higher amount than the AWU could get for those men under the AWU award.

* The same thing happened at Leigh Creek when Wells and Idries Williams of the Miners **Federation** tried to capture Leigh Creek.

* There are demarcation disputes between the Builders Labourers **Federation** and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union over who shall control dogmen, with the builders labourers being able to get a quite substantial amount more under their award than the metal trades workers can get under theirs.

* It is a fact that late last year the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** proposed that there should be 4 producer representatives and 2 representatives from the manufacturing side of the industry.

* At that meeting the **Federation** did not question the Minister's proposal to have 3 producer representatives on the Corporation, but it did strongly support an increase in the number of representatives from the manufacturing side.

* On 3 April, **Federation** representatives advised the Minister that the **Federation** was now seeking a minimum of 4 producer representatives on the Board.

* The important thing was that in subsequent discussions on the number of manufacturers representatives, the Dairy **Federation** representatives advised that they would be happy with 3 producer representatives, providing that there were also 3 manufacturers representatives, that is, they wanted the number restricted to three.

* The **Federation** came to the unanimous decision that it would accept three and three.

* Following that meeting, the Minister received representations from the State Council of the Queensland Dairymen's Organisation, the Victorian Farmers' Union and the **Federation** again requesting 4 producer representatives to ensure an adequate and effective representation on the 
Board.

* So they went back to 4 representatives, after the **Federation** had unanimously agreed to three.

* The Minister for Agriculture, in his reply, told the **Federation** that in his considered view, representation by 3 producers in a total membership of eleven was reasonable compared with the present situation in the Produce Board of three out of thirteen.

* The **Federation**, on the one hand, agreed unanimously to the number of manufacturers representatives being increased to three and that there would be equal representation of three to three- in other words there would be 6 representatives.

* The **Federation** agreed with that.

* This may be a wrong interpretation on my part, but it would appear that something has happened since the **Federation** accepted the proposal.

* The honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd),  I think it was, said that the **Federation** was forced into this position.

* I wanted to clear that point up because I think it is necessary to state on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture the facts relating to the various meetings between the Minister and the Dairy **Federation**.

* He also stated that at the time of **Federation** twothirds of the members of this House represented country areas.

* He thinks that land rights are little more than a slogan and that claims are made- I quote from his address to the Frankston Uniting Church- 'without regard to the legal and political realities of the Australian **Federation**'.

* Rights are not for sale and nor is **federation** a device for evading duties by splitting them between different levels of government.

* The proposed new police force is not really a **federation** of anything.

* In the 71 years since **Federation** Australian voters have been subjected to many dishonest compaigns, but never before have they been subjected to the fraud now being perpetrated by the Country Party.

* As a nation we are now confronted with massive inflation and severe economic instability, the highest interest rates since **federation**, excessive increases in direct and indirect taxation, a crisis in the housing industry unparalleled since the immediate postwar period, record levels of industrial unrest, a severely reduced defence capability, a massive erosion of the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners, uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries, an immigration policy which has heaped confusion upon confusion and a breakdown in communication between the Government and the major constituent groups in the Australian community.

* Therefore I will give my support to the amendment which will be moved during the Committee stage that will protect and preserve a principle that has stood the test of time since **Federation** - the principle of giving a margin of 20 per cent to the Distribution Commissioners when drawing the boundaries for electorates throughout Australia.

* It is, in the Committee's opinion, more in accord with democratic principle and the developments since **Federation** that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least onehalf of the number of States.

* They include the Australian Chemical Industry Council, the Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, the Australian Mining Industry Council, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the National Packaging Association of Australia, the Petroleum Industry Environment Conservation Committee, and the Printing and Allied Trades Employers **Federation** of Australia.

* I suppose that in 75 years of **federation** no Parliament has seen its like.

* The only instrument of change in the whole country - notwithstanding that 70-odd years have passed since **Federation** - has been our High Court.

* Today the Australian Capital Territory Teachers **Federation** commenced a campaign of rolling strikes designed to put pressure on the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  to increase the number of teachers to be made available to the Australia Capital Territory government schools system.

* It is the desire of people who live a long way from the seat of government and who feel sometimes that **federation** has failed.

* The APF has compiled its own regulations- for the information of honourable members I also table the regulations -in addition to those contained in the ANO, and all members of that **Federation** are required to comply.

* The Department has always found the **Federation** to be a responsible body, and this is borne out by its actions following this accident.

* This parachutist was subsequently suspended from all parachute operations for 28 days and had his parachute instructor rating suspended for 6 months by the **Federation**.

* This action was taken by officers of the **Federation** after consultation with the departmental officer.

* The APF also took action against the pilot, who is an experienced parachutist and a member of the **Federation**.

* He too had his senior instructor's rating suspended for 6 months and it has been recommended to the **Federation** board of directors that it be cancelled.

* In view of the action taken by the **Federation** against members contravening its regulations the statement by the honourable member that the **Federation** has failed to enforce its own regulations is incorrect.

* It is evident that the **Federation** does in fact exercise strict control over parachuting operations conducted under its auspices.

* In this respect, on 20 January 1975, the **Federation**'s Director of Safety sent a hard hitting letter to all safety officers of the **Federation**.

* There have been departmental discussions with the Australian Farmers **Federation**, and  1  will be meeting the **Federation** shortly.

* The tolerance principle has been accepted in Australia since **Federation**, and it has been accepted in many other countries.

* The dairy farmer representatives are appointed by the Minister for Primary Industry from a panel of names submitted to him by the Australian Dairy Farmers' **Federation** or by another organisaton of dairy farmers.

* The  Chairman  is appointed by the Minister after consultation with the Australian Meat Board Selection Committee (a non-statutory body consisting of four representatives each of the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation** and an independent  Chairman).

* Has the Australian **Federation** of Aquarium Fish Importers and Traders a 108 page report currently before the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which is inquiring into the adequacy of quarantine measures to protect pastoral industries from exotic diseases.

* I wish to make it quite clear at the outset, on behalf of the Government Members Small Business Committee, and I think on behalf of nearly all members of the Government parties, that we welcome the statement made today because undoubtedly it is the most definitive statement made on small business in the history of this **Federation**.

* When the honourable gentlemen sitting opposite were in government they did more to increase the general administrative burden through various regulatory agencies on small business than did any other government in the history of **federation**.

* I am sure that the Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia would regard him with the same son of contempt.

* I believe it should be pointed out in discussion on these Bills that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, which represents the wheat industry, has requested that the maximum rate of tax specified in the Act be raised to 30c per tonne.

* While asking for the maximum rate to be raised the **Federation** has also sought an increase in the operative tax from the present level of 15c per tonne to 20c per tonne.

* For this reason it is of some satisfaction to note that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, which represents the wheat industry, requested that the maximum rate of tax be raised to 30c per tonne and that when amending legislation was enacted there be an increase in the operative tax from 15c to 20c per tonne.

* The Association is totally opposed to these recommendations, and it will continue to act through the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** in putting its views to the Federal Government.

* The benefits of the wheat research scheme which has operated since 1957 should be clear to the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, to the Government and to the IAC.

* Can he say whether notice of the Annual General Meeting of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations was called by the Executive Director,  Mr Allan  McCann, in breach of section 39 of the constitution of that organisation, as amended to April 1978, and therefore casts doubts on the legality of the existing Executive Committee 's functions.

* What Government assistance has the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations received in the last 2 years.

* Can he supply the membership details of the **Federation** and of each affiliate body.

* Is the supply of details of membership within affiliate bodies a condition of the Government's consideration of financial assistance to the **Federation**; if so, what details are required.

* Is he also able to say whether the bulk of the **Federation**'s membership is derived from the Australian Consumers Association.

* As events happened the Labor Party lost very narrowly in what was the most closely contested election in the history of our **federation**.

* We could abolish the differences between State, Federal and Territory jurisdiction which have bedevilled our courts since **Federation**.

* 1 want to congratulate the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** for writing into its submissions to the Government a provision to ensure that an additional 10 million bushels of prime hard wheat were made available in this year's quota.

* This is what the Wheatgrowers **Federation** has attempted to do.

* It was the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, the supreme body of wheat growers in this country, which in its wisdom decided on the quota proposals and the way in which the quota system is to be administered rests with the State governments which have undertaken to apply it to the individuals.

* The Minister for Primary Industry works wilh the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, with the Wheat Board- 
The struggle in Australia from early **Federation** is whether in fact responsible government will kill federalism or federalism will kill responsible government.

* has been the recent formation of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations which will be invited to submit matters of concern to consumers to the Government.

* At that time he was answering a question, asked by the honourable member for Leichhardt  (Mr Thomson),  relating to the dispute between Connair Pty Ltd and the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* However when the document was tabled I found that it read as follows: 
Can the Minister indicate to the House the present position in regard to the dispute between Connair and the Air Pilots **Federation** which has resulted in a ban on airline services to Alice Springs, and the crippling of that town by the Air Pilots Association?

* Southwell of **Federation** said Sunday rather Connair went wall rather than go back to work.

* The principal unions involved in the bans affecting trade with Indonesia and Chile were the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Australian Seamen's Union.

* -This Bill is a most important piece of legislation and it affects a probably unique body in any **federation** in the world which exists to look after the financial fortunes of the constituent parts of that **federation**.

* In other words, the Grants Commission exists, and has existed for over 40 years, to look after the affairs, the services and the standards available to the citizens in each of the States within the Australian **Federation**.

* It contains probably more benefits than any other Budget since **Federation**.

* However I might say, because I am proud of it, that he has helped greatly in having the Mallee electorate mentioned by name more often in this House than any other electorate since **Federation**.

* The Labor Government's and the Australian Labor Party's awareness of the responsibilities and the needs of local government and the role that local government had to play in the overall structure of the **federation** was reflected in the action that we took when we were in government.

* -In this debate on the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill, I will deal with four main points: Firstly, the Commonwealth 's generosity in relation to State finance; secondly, the historical background to the Bill; thirdly, the new federalism proposals that have been introduced by this Government and the new **federation** arrangements which have resulted; and, finally, Australia's economic problems, the role of the Commonwealth and the States and their recent records.

* They include such notable left wing unions as the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, the Australian Building and Construction Workers' **Federation**- it has now reregisteredand the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees' Union of Australia.

* The decision of this Government to grant local government access to the Grants Commission is the biggest break-through for local government that has been made since **Federation**.

* Before leaving the point of instability in government which was one of the tragic results of that shameful episode, let me point out that a **federation** like ours, with the short 3-year terms, is the last place in the world which requires these extraordinary powers for the Senate.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  has to accept some responsibility too, because when he was Minister for Labor and National Service he received plenty of advice from organisations such as the Electrical Contractors **Federation** of Victoria, the Fibrous Plaster Manufacturers Association, the Housing Industry Association, the Meat and Allied Trades **Federation** of Australia, the Master Builders Association, the Master Plumbers Association, the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures and- this is an organisation the honourable member for Balaclava  (Mr Macphee)  would know about- the Victorian Employers **Federation**.

* Australia joining in a **federation** it is the hope that the Federal Government will ensure that Australians are provided with uniform standards of service by their Government and have a uniform system of taxation to fund those services.

* This legislation results from the initiative of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, which is the industrial organisation representing Australian wheat fanners, and the Australian Wheat Board, which is the marketing authority, and, through its legislative process, the association that it has with the various State handling authorities.

* I congratulate the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** for developing this initiative.

* If the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** requested the Commonwealth and the States to introduce a scheme to discourage the growing of unacceptable varieties of wheat in Australia, then I believe that the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  and members of this House would be under some obligation to make provision for such protection.

* Members of the Wheatgrowers **Federation** have told me that they have given a great deal of time and attention to the most practical way of permitting the Australian Wheat Board to sell wheat for stock feed purposes.

* I am not suggesting that the States have always behaved in an exemplary way throughout the history of our **Federation**.

* He, his colleagues and his fellow travellers in Darwin, including Manning and members of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, are persecuting the operators of small ships.

* If we go back through the annals of this Parliament since **federation** we find that we had our Doctor Moloney, our King O'Malley, our Eddie Ward and our Brennan.

* Events in this period of time were led and abetted by the Leader of the Opposition who has depraved, degraded and denigrated Parliament more than any other member of this House since **federation**.

* The first is that the present Opposition is perhaps the worst Opposition this Parliament has had the misfortune to be inflicted with since **Federation**.

* Sixty-nine years after **Federation** we are still without a national water programme.

* Sixty-nine years after **Federation** we are still without a national water conservation authority.

* Well, I think it should be known that, as far as irrigation alone is concerned, in the 69 years of **Federation** we have spent less as a nation on irrigation as such than we have spent in importing whisky every year.

* I simply do not think the **Federation** could stand the seizure by the Federal Government of Crown land belonging to a State and I do not think that the constitutional validity of the referendum is of any value.

* Realising that another large crop in 1969-70 would compound these problems, the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** formulated a plan in March 1969 aimed at bringing production to manageable levels.

* In 1970-71, the Australian quota was 295 million bushels; in 1971-72 it was 314 million' bushels and this year we know that the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** asked for a quota of 407 million bushels to which the Australian Government and the various States have agreed.

* If members of the Government want to end industrial arbitration of the type which has existed in Australia since **federation** then let them stand up and say that this is what they want, instead of running around the corner and seeking divisive means such as the introduction of a productivity requirement in national wage judgments.

* For instance, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** has expressed grave anxiety on this point.

* Mr O'Brien,  the  President  of the **Federation**, issued a Press release on 23 Maythat is, on Tuesday of this week.

* He said: 
I refer again to the Press release of  Mr O'Brien,  the  President  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, issued last Tuesday after he had been to see the Treasurer for the purpose of discussing this matter with him.

* Up to the present time the only body which has exercised any responsible attitude to what type of buildings should go up has been the Builders Labourers **Federation** with its highly commendable policy of preserving Sydney's heritage.

* I should like to see the Builders Labourers **Federation** exert a similar influence to ensure that priorities in the building industry go towards building houses and not office blocks.

* I believe it is quite justifiable for the working people of Australia, such as members of the Builders Labourers **Federation**, to have a similar say in the direction of investment in Australia.

* I abhor the fact that in doing this in the public interest, at the cost of their own welfare, members of the Builders Labourers **Federation** found that their organisation was deregistered.

* Unfortunately in the area of oilseeds there is no single organisation which covers oilseeds producers, although in the legislation the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** is written in as a representative and an organisation with apparent veto powers over government actions in this field.

* I think it is fair to say that the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** does not represent the majority of oilseed growers.

* One concern which the Opposition has to express is that there is no suggestion that the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** Oilseeds Committee should be expanded to include representatives of oilseed growers who belong to other organisations which are not now covered and which in some instances have been refused access to the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation**.

* I do not wish to judge the viability or otherwise of primary producer organisations, their effectiveness or their professional competence, but it has been suggested by at least one academic that the influence of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** over the present Government is such that it has acted to the detriment of the industry in the wheat area.

* I am informed that at least one of those organisations has been denied access to the oil growers committee of the Australian Wheatgrowers ' **Federation**.

* But time has not been sufficient to enable the thorough assessment of all the relevent factors; nor, in some cases, for the detailed consultations which are necessary not only with industry, but also between the Commonwealth and the other Governments in our **Federation**.

* The Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots has submitted evidence on a number of occasions to Public Works Committees drawing attention to the fact that, provided everything went well, there would not be aborted takeoffs such as this one, and the runways were quite long enough.

* However, the **Federation** pointed out that in the event of any problem developing, such as the pilot overshooting the threshhold on touchdown or a belated or aborted takeoff the runways were not long enough.

* The Public Works Committee of this Parliament and the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots have drawn attention time and time again to the short runways.

* In March this year the **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations held a seminar in Sydney on 'Australian universities after four years of cost cutting'.

* The effect of this sort of mindlessness in education policies is effectively expressed in an advertisement authorised by the **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations which was published a few days ago.

* The **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations is seriously worried that the funds available for each research worker have slumped by nearly 50 per cent- from $7,380 per researcher to $3,800- in the decade to 1 976.

* Authorised by L. B. Wallis on behalf of the **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations, 499 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.

* To put it in terms which are most appropriate to the Australian **Federation**, those States which effectively are the subsidisers should not have a living standard lower than those States which are the net recipients of subsidies through industry protection of one kind or another.

* We merely request that the amount of those transfers be known, calculated, measured and discussed within the Australian **federation**.

* There is something wrong with the distribution of resources within the economic **federation** of Australia.

* This Parliament, since **Federation**, has had its share of Camerons.

* Ewen 
-by leave-To the best of our knowledge the Conference of Commonwealth and State Public Accounts Committees was the first occasion since **Federation** that equivalent committees of the Parliaments of Australia have met with the common purpose of giving greater substance to Parliament's traditional responsibility of effectively reviewing the financial activities of the Executive Government, to ensure that funds are spent as Parliament intended and that taxpayers do in fact receive value for money.

* For some time now I have been the National President of the All Australia Karate Do **Federation**.

* Whilst the tournament is being organised by the **Federation** of All Japan Karate Do Organisations, it has the firm support of the Japanese Government in that the Japanese Ministry of Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Transport and the Metropolitan Government of Tokyo are assisting the Japanese body in the organisation of the world tournament.

* On 10th September this year, with great optimism and faith that Australia's own airline company would do something for  an  Australian team, I formally wrote  to  Qantas, advising  it  of the departure coverage which had been promised and that  if  the newspaper concerned was unable to mention Qantas  in  its build-up articles, the **Federation**  in  Australia would place advertisements next to the articles to bring about the association which Qantas would require.

* I participated with the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia over many years in trying to get a superannuation scheme.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia is not included.

* The statement made by the Prime Minister mentioned the maritime unions alone; it did not mention the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* One of the Press reports states that the Minister for Transport had given a guarantee that the Waterside Workers **Federation** and  Mr Fitzgibbon  would not suffer any action against them as a result of indemnity payments made to  Mr Fitzgibbon  or the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Therefore it is utterly critical that there be specific mention of the Waterside Workers **Federation** in the terms of reference of the royal commission.

* Failing that, the only thing that could meet this case, which the suspension of Standing Orders would give an opportunity to the Government to provide, would be a clear statement by the Government that the Government agrees with your ruling that the Waterside Workers **Federation** is involved, that the indemnity payments- almost $400,000 is mentioned in the newspapers in connection with the Waterside Workers **Federation**- will also be the subject of this inquiry.

* I believe also that that statement now misrepresents the position of the Waterside Workers **Federation** in this matter.

* It is necessary to have a clear distinction between single permit ships around the Australian coast, which have largely been the subject of alleged Seamen's Union activities, and the campaign of the International Transport **Federation** against the flags of convenience ships whose rates of pay for seamen are at unreasonably low levels.

* The campaign of the International Transport **Federation** goes back to an International Labor Organisation Convention which was ratified by Australia some considerable time ago.

* The constitutional provisions presuppose that before a person ventures to seek election to the office of the Chief Executive of the **Federation**, he would order his own life in accordance with the law, injunctions and teachings of Holy Qur'an and Sunnah.

* The legislation we are examining has virtually been the same since **Federation**, 72 years ago.

* The Labor Party is trying to break down the fair and just principles by which Federal redistributions have been carried out since **Federation**.

* Members of the Opposition are suggesting that the one body that has been established since **Federation** and the one body that has now had 2 years to collate information on the needs of local government and its various disabilities and revenue capacitiesthe Grants Commission- should be disbanded and carved up into half a dozen State grants commissions.

* We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with Australian Council of Trade Unions policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* As one who for a long time has advocated rational change in the Constitution, as one who attended and supported the concept of the Australian Constitutional Convention - the first* since **Federation** - I think that this exercise in futility by the Government needs to be put into perspective.

* I have searched through perhaps the most important book on early **federation**, and that is the book written by Quick and Garran.

* I have been intrigued by the attitude which underlies the honourable member's speech, in that he was concerned about the position of the States in the **federation**.

* Thus, in the case of the Master Builders' Association and the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation**, Commissioner Taylor ordered a company to make good the wages withheld from members of the union who were on strike because, firstly, the amenities were unsatisfactory and, secondly, the company had failed to abide by an agreement for the settlement of the dispute by private arbitration.

* 1 ) Has he received the report of the study into the 3 airports given 'black star' ratings by the International **Federation** of Airline Pilots in April 1977.

* We will be able to make a contribution not only to the training of draftsmen here to serve this Parliament but also to the training of draftsmen for the States within the **Federation** of Australia.

* The ultimate reason for inter-governmental grants in a **federation** is a lack of balance between the financial powers and responsibilities of the different levels of government.

* The Government would certainly listen to any advice, criticism or recommendation from all bodies concerned, and would take such views into consideration when the industry **federation** comes up with a recommendation.

* We have seen the development of a process of public inquiry that started in this country with the formation of the Tariff Board early in the history of the **Federation**.

* Let us look at the situation from a little further distance in history because I think this will illustrate that almost since the days of **Federation** the Opposition has failed to comprehend how to examine a Budget statement.

* The Liberal-Country Party Government in 1965 made some very significant changes to section 19 of the Electoral Act - which, as I stated, had remained unchanged practically since **Federation** - In regard to matters to be considered in the distribution of a State into electoral Divisions.

* It made it mandatory for the Commissioners to give due consideration to the new criteria set out in the amendments including - I repeat them - the following: 
The Waterside Workers **Federation** has collected at least $370,000 from ship companies paying wages below international rates.

* I ask the honourable member for Gippsland not to refer to payments made to the Waterside Workers **Federation** because that matter is covered by paragraph (b) of part 1 of the terms of reference.

* After long consultation with other people I have ruled that paragraph (b) of part 1 of the terms of reference covers the Waterside Workers **Federation** because it is a corporate body.

* The next five or ten years will see some of the most rapid changes to the structure of our industries, working conditions and hours of work such as has not been seen in this country since **Federation**.

* Once again the Government found itself relatively naked in this crazy **federation**, operating this stupid system without sufficient tools to counter properly the trends that are befalling us.

* Do not let honourable members opposite come into this House and start berating the Opposition for the attitude it takes on a piece of legislation which is akin to the very worst behaviour of any government during the period since **Federation**.

* We know that since Labor came into power officers are voting with their feet in the greatest numbers ever in the history of this **Federation**.

* The draftsmen of the Constitution included these provisions because they knew- and this is a matter of historical fact- that the smaller States, that is smaller in population, would not vote for **Federation** unless they have some protection given to them in the Senate and they got it.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal waters as they existed at **Federation**, it has sovereign rights in this area.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal waters as they existed at **federation**, the States hare no such rights.

* In the case of a federal state, where for domestic purposes supreme legislative and executive power is divided between the **federation** and its component states or provinces, the question frequently arises whether the control of off-shore resources is exercisable, as a matter of internal constitutional law, by the **federation** itself, or by its component states or provinces, or is shared between both.

* In Canada by virtue of a special legislative provision, the question was referred to the Supreme Court at the instance of the **Federation** itself in relation to the Province of British Columbia.

* Sovereign control over the mineral resources of both the territorial sea and the continental shelf was held to be vested in the **Federation** alone, to the exclusion of the component States or Provinces.

* To re-establish a pattern of cooperation in national affairs and reverse the excessive centralising of power in Australia, the Government proposes to make the most important reform of the Federal system since **Federation**.

* There are some unions like the Waterside Workers **Federation** which for reasons that would be obvious to anyone who understands the industry do not operate and would see no point or future in operating in the State systems.

* In the 1940s the **Federation** did make an application to the South Australian Industrial Court for a State award to cover waterside workers employed by the Broken Hill Pry Co. Ltd at Whyalla.

* But apart from that one single occasion when the Waterside Workers **Federation** sought to enter the State industrial system that union has never sought to take such action.

* However, details relating to most of these companies can be found in the Australian Automotive Products Export Directory, issued by the **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufacturers, Industry House, Canberra.

* Since **Federation** many Budgets have been introduced into this House.

* Secretariat grants are made to the Royal **Federation** of Aero Clubs of Australia and the General Aviation Association (Australia).

* A special gliding grant is made to the Gliding **Federation** of Australia mainly to reimburse the **Federation** pan of its costs arising from its responsibilities under the Air Navigation Regulations.

* -In this Bill the Government honours yet another 1977 election policy commitment, an election policy commitment which, along with many others, swept the Fraser Government, back into power with the largest majority in the history of this country since **Federation**.

* I rose for one reason and that is because the members of this House are playing a pathetic game with the most serious subject debated in this House since **Federation**.

* Sir Robert  Menzies made the statement conceding that this was a matter of prime importance in our **federation**.

* I addressed a meeting of bankers and industrialists at the **Federation** of German Industry in Cologne on 1 6 January.

* The include: the  President,  Aluminium Development Council, the  President,  Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, the  President,  Australian Chemical Industry Council, the  President,  Australian Electrical Manufacturers' Association, the  President,  Australian Industries Development Association, the  President,  **Federation** of Automotive Products Manufacturers, the  President,  Heavy Engineering Manufacturers' Association, the  President,  Metal Trades Industry Association and the  President,  The Textile Council of Australia, among others.

* The workers in the various terminals who, incidentally, are not members of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, have been deeply conscious of their position as members of the Australian work force.

* It would be disastrous if the Waterside Workers **Federation** were allowed access to wheat terminals, thus disrupting the present amicable working arrangements.

* He was as old at the time of **federation** as I was when I entered this Parliament.

* The Australian Dairy Industry Council and the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** have got together to try to map out some sort of plan with respect to the future of the dairy industry and the bind it is in at present with respect to equalisation.

* We stand irrevocably committed to the concept of Australia as a nation composed of the 6 States which make up the **Federation**.

* We are a **federation**, and we would make it work as a co-operative **federation**.

* The important Supreme Court case of Pollard's lessee v. Hagan in 1845 established that States entering the Union subsequent to the original **federation** were admitted on an equal footing and therefore acquired the same sovereign and proprietary rights in tidal lands and submerged lands under internal waters.

* It is most doubtful that this neglect of judicial history would be possible in an Australian court, especially if it is found that the States' boundaries were somehow frozen at colonial inception or at **federation**.

* States v. California case in 1947 it was not clear how these rights were divided in the **federation**.

* It is an adjudication which cannot be avoided in any **federation**.

* Neither consideration is material in the Australian **Federation**; nor is the Supreme Court's argument in rebuttal of Texan claims that the 'equal footing' clause be invoked.

* In summarising that particular case, once again this sort of adjudication is inevitable in any **federation**, given the need to define the baseline from which the territorial sea is to be measured, and given the concept of internal waters which are part of the land territory for legal purposes.

* Again, however, it is submitted that in the Australian **federation** it is unlikely that a court will be able to incorporate current international criteria into the Australian constitutional structure.

* Firstly, it is probable that the Australian States maritime boundaries, encompassing internal waters and possibly also the territorial sea, were fixed either at colonial inception or at **federation**.

* Secondly, there are many more component States in the American **federation**, with far more variegated and even colourful constitutional histories, than in the Australian **federation** where by contrast constitutional development has been fairly uniform.

* The Minister has informed us that the request for research arose through the Australian Commercial Pig Producers **Federation** which is the Federal organisation of the pig industry.

* The **Federation** consists of 6 State councils which represent the great majority, as the Minister has said, of the pig farmers in Australia.

* The Federal Pig Committee of the Victorian Farmers' **Federation** has expressed grave concern at the way research projects are frequently determined.

* I have in my hand a letter from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation** signed by Irene Ellis, the national honorary secretary.

* That circular, which was sent to all members of this Parliament, states: 
This **Federation** calls for an immediate examination of the whole Australian social service structure and the appointment of a committee to carry out a full scale public inquiry into providing a more humane and equitable pensions system.

* Honourable members should bear in mind that the Australian Wool Industry Conference is comprised of equal representation from the 2 major constitutent wool growing bodies in Australia - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation**.

* Mr Reginald  Vernon Sewell has been  President  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' **Federation** since 1964.

* Surely this is the situation that faces the Government starkly in Australian **federation** at the moment.

* In 1967, an agreement was reached by a national conference, consisting of representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers' **Federation**, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Labour and National Service on a scheme for permanent employment in the stevedoring industry.

* However, a recent agreement on wages and conditions between the employers and the **Federation** to which the ACTU was a party includes a no-strike clause on these issues for a period of 2 years.

* Therefore, I have had discussions individually with  Mr Woodward,  Q.C., with the  Chairman  of the Authority and with representatives of the ACTU, the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour.

* The employers and the **Federation** must realise that the future structure of the industry depends very much on their performance over the next 2 years.

* There are several points of principle involved, and the Opposition would have liked to move an amendment to this Bill which, while not refusing it a second reading, would have indicated our concern that special provision should have been made for implementing an extended research program into insect infestation of wheat, on the basis outlined by the Minister for Primary Industry to the Australian Agricultural Council and the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* I now draw attention to clause 3 (2) of the Bill which provides that the rate can be varied after consideration by the Governor-General of a report made to the Minister by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**'.

* What I am seeking from the Minister for Northern Development and the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for Primary Industry, is a firm undertaking that if the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** decides that the tax of 11c per tonne is insufficient to meet the needs for which the fund was established, and if it agrees to a higher grower contribution, the Government will match that increased contribution from the industry.

* Therefore, the incentive to switch to those products, which was recognised by the Pig Breeders **Federation** in its submission to the Committee, is quite high.

* In a **federation**, it is distributed between central and State governments.

* Both the **Federation** of Consumer Organisations and the Food Industry Council of Australia have attacked this deficiency, and the formula, because it has tied the price to the rate of change in the consumer price index and thereby shields the industry, to a degree, from market signals.

* One could instance the way in which the Wheatgrowers' **Federation**, the Wheat Board and the State Governments, together with the Commonwealth, make up the Wheat Agreement.

* Today I received a copy of a telegram which was sent by  Mr Kelly,  the General  President  of the Australian Coal and Shale Employees' **Federation**, to the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony.

* Mr Kelly  stated: 
Miners **Federation** requests urgent discussions regarding export quotas and prices of export coal.

* During the early 1970s the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Wool Industry Conference all requested the then Liberal-Country Party Government to agree to a fixed floor price scheme.

* Dr Don  von Bibra, again acting without authority, apparently has committed the Australian Wool Industry Conference policy committee to a degree of support for the wool exchange proposal that one major organisation, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, would not have a bar of.

* The Association was supported in that approach by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, but once more there is prevarication.

* They looked at the old South African provincial system and they said: 'This **federation** is not for us.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* Nevertheless, we do live in a **federation**, we do live in a country where we all call ourselves Australians, and perhaps reluctantly at times when I am supporting the very important dairy industry sector of my electorate I have to acknowledge that whatever mistakes have been made in the past the Victorians are in a situation, the Victorians are in a position where they, for better or worse, are producing relatively efficiently and they have to be thought of.

* I note also that the thrust of the legislation follows the views of the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**, which recently sent a telex to the Minister setting out its ideas on how selective underwriting should work.

* He was a former official of the Federated Ironworkers' **Federation**.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** at that time commenced a struggle for an industry pension, for two reasons.

* 1 think I should pay a tribute to the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation**,  Mr Charles  Fitzgibbon, at this time, because I know that no other man in the industry fought harder than he did for an end to the casual system.

* The federal co-ordinating committee shall be composed of representatives of the major employers- the Australian Employers of Waterfront Labour- BHP, the Australian National Line and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* They have equal representatives from the industry users, the employers and the union, in this case the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Since I came into this House I have heard two explicit attacks on the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* Early in 1976, after the Foster report had proved inconclusive and the Northrop inquiry was set up, the Waterside Workers **Federation** was asked to submit proposals.

* We found that the original proposals of the Waterside Workers **Federation** are almost without exception the same proposals as this Bill implements.

* This Government, which is so fond of union bashing, is legislating to give responsibility for the administration of the Australian stevedoring industry to the Australian Employers of Waterfront Labour and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Minister for Education and Science, in presenting the Bill, specifically rejects many of the submissions of the Australian Teachers' **Federation**, and, in so doing, ignored the status of teaching as a profession and its consequential duty to run its own affairs.

* Therefore, in rejecting the submission of the Teachers **Federation** that more weight should be given to seniority, the Government is not merely asserting a belief in promotion by merit, but making assumptions about the educational process that educationists would regard as totally unacceptable.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** wishes to have 3 commissioners.

* A similar point may be made in relation to the Minister's rejection of the submission from the **Federation** that an advisory council should be established to act with the Commissioner.

* Again in relation to the submissions of the Australian Teachers **Federation**, the Minister for Education and Science claims that it is not possible to specify whom the Commissioner should regard as qualified for employment.

* This Bill will do nothing to alter the fundamental disabilities from which local government has suffered since **federation**.

* The Prime Minister is wedded to concepts of federalism that pre-date **Federation**, that will entrench State bureaucracies, that will strengthen the domination of local government by State bureaucracies to the detriment of true regionalism and the welfare of the Australian people.

* This is what the Minister said when speaking at the conference of the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers' **Federation**.

* That article went on: 
This is tremendously good advice but who can do this - the growers in the Huon Valley, the **Federation** or that conference?

* One of the things which is obvious in our country is that since **Federation** we have not yet become truly a nation in trade, finance, investment or any of the other major matters.

* Since the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation** and the Australian Wool Industry Conference have unanimously recommended the establishment of a single wool marketing authority, will the Minister now confer with the industry leaders?

* The indemnity payments admitted to have been made to the Waterside Workers' **Federation**.

* In the meantime the Australian **Federation** of Private Hospitals has no complaints, but the thousands of people in the area who have signed petitions against the Colyton sellout suggest that most people living there do have complaints.

* Dr Hughes,  who is  President  of the **Federation** of Private Hospitals, is the endorsed Liberal candidate for the Australian Capital Territory.

* I would regard the report of tonight's proceedings more as a book which could be titled: 'Paddy's Day, 1971- Advice from the Child of **Federation** to the States'.

* The Minister takes some comfort from the fact that he consulted with the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* And the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* -I ask the Minister whether he consulted the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* My information is that he consulted the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**.

* I do not wish to engage in an exchange across the floor like this but I repeat that my information - and the Minister will have an opportunity to deny it at the right time - is that he consulted with the New South Wales Teachers **Federation** on one occasion 3 weeks before the tabling of this Bill in this House.

* He also saw the Australian Teachers **Federation** representatives on only 2 occasions.

* Territorial Air Services, but a complaint has recently been received from the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* The complaint does relate to the exceeding of flight time and duty time limitations, but no specific reports had been submitted to the Department prior to the receipt of the letter from the **Federation**.

* The Victorian Employers **Federation** calculated last year that if payroll tax were to be abolished altogether, another 100,000 persons would be employed in Australia.

* It must be admitted that although the Miners' **Federation**'s efforts to re-establish the levy have been fought without success, nevertheless reestablishment of the levy remains a fundamentally correct plank of the Miners' **Federation** policy.

* Since commencement of miners' pensions, the Miners' **Federation** has pressed with varying degrees of vigour for compulsorily retired mine workers to qualify for age pensions as from the date of their compulsory retirement.

* President of the Northern District Miners **Federation**, for the information contained in the documents I have before me.

* What arrangements has the Government made to have their replacements made in consultation with the Australian Council of State School Organisations and the Australian Teachers **Federation**?

* An agreement was made with the **Federation** so that the early introduction of this valuable safety aid would not be delayed.

* the Air Safety Investigation Branch requests and the flight crew and **Federation** agree that analysis of the record should be made in circumstances other than the foregoing.

* It was indicated to the Australian **Federation** that similar principles would be observed in Australia in the event of access to recordings being otherwise unrestricted.

* lt can be argued that cockpit audio recorders involve, in some measure, considerations such as invasion of privacy and, for these reasons, the **Federation** was concerned that, in matters such as litigation, their members were exposed beyond the extent of exposure of other members of the community.

* The Department had some sympathy for the **Federation**'s views but it was hoped that time would demonstrate that the safety advantage of the equipment far outweighed any other considerations.

* Unions in that category are the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union, the Vehicle Builders Employees **Federation**, .the Australian Workers Union and the Federated.

* Dr Levinsion is currently Secretary-General of the International **Federation** of Chemical and General Workers' Unions in Geneva.

* We will provide a sound basis of financial independence and responsibility for the States and Local Governments with the most significant reform of the federal system since **Federation**.

* No government since **Federation** has been more determined to reduce the size of government and reduce taxation.

* It may be viewed either as a loose confederation of quasi-independent states, or as a national **federation**.

* Our Constitution must be clear, dynamic and forward looking, and it must, in my opinion, serve the purpose of an Australian **federation** of States, and not preserve a confederation.

* Secondly, the Commonwealth in its attempt to set limits on internal waters without altering any boundaries, has purported merely to fix the limits of internal waters as they were at **Federation**.

* The legal assumption here is that **Federation** in some way froze the limits of the States at 1901.

* And this is 72 years after **Federation**.

* I am informed that the meeting was called by  Mr Allan  McCann as an approved delegate of the Secretary/ Treasurer of the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations in accordance with sections 39 and 45 (b) of the Constitution of that organisation, as amended to April 1 978.

* In each of the financial years 1977-78 and 1978-79 the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations has received a Commonwealth Grant-in-Aid of $85,000.

* (a) The members of the **Federation** are consumer organisations, and they currently number 53.

* These names are: 
Australian Capital Territory- Canberra Consumer Incorporated; Citroen Association of Canberra; Consumer Affairs Council of the Australian Capital Territory; Dietetic Association, ACT Inc.; Health Care Consumers Association of ACT; The Australian Association of Dietitians; The Co-operative **Federation** of Australia.

* The Australian Consumer Association is but one of the 53 member organisations of the **Federation**.

* Members of the Waterside Workers' **Federation** and other maritime unions have on a number of occasions, withheld labour for cargo handling or berthing facilities from vessels the crews of which have been in receipt of wage rates below levels specified by the International Transport Workers' **Federation** (ITF).

* The actions of the Waterside Workers' **Federation** have been in support of a campaign sanctioned by the ITF and aimed at improving wages and working conditions of seafarers throughout the world.

* The Waterside Workers' **Federation** has taken such industrial action in its capacity as agent of the ITF in the Pacific region.

* It was a modest proposal, the main aim being to rationalise on a national basis those State government insurance offices which were prepared to come into the rationalisation, the **federation**.

* Wheat growers only have to look back to last year when there was a re-negotiation of the wheat stabilisation plan and the Labor Party tried to rubbish the recommendations of the Wheatgrowers **Federation**, the representative voice of the wheat growers.

* Also quite recently this organisation formed a **federation** in Bourke.

* It is against that background that I urge the Government to look very carefully at the requests of the 

 Mr K. H. McLeod, General Secretary of the Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation**.

* West, an Executive Member of the Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation**.

* Mr S. M. Crabb, member of the Federal Executive Committee of the Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation**.

* Mr P. W. Reilly, General  President  of the Australian Insurance Staffs **Federation**.

* As the Budget Papers indicate, at **Federation** we had 4.57 per cent of the population of the Australian States, but 70 years later our percentage of population of the Australian States had fallen to 3.07.

* In this respect our position in the Australian **federation** is unique, as the other States have road, rail, sea and air services available for use if they are needed.

* It recognised Tasmania's unique position in the Australian **federation** as regards its dependence on sea transport, the high proportion of export trade and the small domestic market.

* The Committee confirmed - these decisions by the Committee are important ones - that in terms of freight costs Tasmania is at a disadvantage relative to other States and that as an island State Tasmania has no interstate links except by sea and air and in this respect its position in the Australian **federation** is unique.

* The honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Sherry)  asked me whether I had heard from the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* At the time when he was speaking to these estimates I had not, but since then I have received a letter from the **Federation** and I will be conveying its suggestions to the Interim Council for the Film and Television Training School so that it can take them into account because I believe that important above all things in the film industry is that there should be complete co-operation between the Film Development Corporation the Interim Council and the industry itself.

* ACTU, CCPSO, ACPSA, Victorian Employers' **Federation**, MTIA, National Employers' Policy Committee.

* Sir John  Egerton, the Minister for Local Government in Queensland, the International Airline Pilots **Federation** and the Australian National Tourist Association have all said that the only option that is available is the relocation of the airstrip.

* This is causing a great deal of concern amongst the International **Federation** of Airline Pilots, the local body as well and the air traffic controllers.

* Further, the article said that a spokesman for the Australian Farmers **Federation** said: 
Government securities on issue is a precise legal and financial concept, and an examination of it reflects the effectiveness of the government of the day as the occupier of the Treasury bench.

* This is a record debt per head of population in Australia since **Federation**.

* Under the present Government, Australia is already experiencing the highest bond rate since **Federation**.

* From 1st October 1971, pilots employed by Ansett Airlines of Australia refused to fly with five Ansett pilots who were non-members of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* This refusal arose out of a resolution passed by the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots on 2nd June 1971.

* The refusal to fly on the part of Ansett pilots continued until 8th November when the five pilots who were the subjects of the refusal applied to join the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots as either members or agency clients of the **Federation**.

* On the 5th August 1971, after the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots advised Ansett Airlines of Australia of its resolution directing members not to fly with any pilot who was not a **Federation** member or agency client the company notified the matter to the Flight Crew Officers' Industrial Tribunal.

* Later, after the **Federation** resolution had been implemented by member pilots employed by Ansett Airlines of Australia, the company advised the Tribunal of serious and deteriorating developments in the matter.

* The notices of termination of employment were subsequently withdrawn by the company on 8th November after the **Federation** lifted its ban.

* On 8th November, after further hearings, the Tribunal dismissed the Air Pilots' Guild's claim for an award under Section 41 (1) (d) (i) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, on the grounds that as all pilots employed by Ansett Airlines would in future be covered by the current Pilots' Award, to which the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots is a party, there remained no grounds for making the Air Pilots' Guild of Australia party to an award.

* They are the Builders Labourers **Federation**, Building Workers Industrial Union, Plumbers and Gasfitters Union, Electrical Trades Union, Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, Waterside Workers **Federation**, Seamen's Union and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association.

* I think it is a credit to the Government and particularly to the right honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  as well as to the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr/ Nixon), and the industry itself, largely through the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, that the arrangements that have been negotiated and we are now debating in the form of these Bills before the House have been achieved.

* ( 
Growers **Federation** has done its part.

* Secondly, it can redress some of the inconveniences which stem from the rigidity of State boundaries which are really boundaries of chance when we look back to the time of **Federation**.

* Whilst the western miners of New South Wales have the highest rate of output per man now in Australia, I exhort the rank and file unionists to take a keen interest in the **federation** and the unions' policies to ensure that equity and common sense prevails at all times.

* In the early years after **Federation**, employees of the Commonwealth Public Service set a standard for the rest of Australia in conditions of employment.

* At the time of **Federation** local government was allocated to the States, and it has been their responsibility from that time.

* I have studied the history of the AWU and I have documentation to prove that Spence was never given authority by the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation** to make that threat against the owners of Jondaryan.

* The view has been taken by some of the States, and indeed by the Australian Road Transport **Federation** and by many road transport operators that the use of the words 'the Commission may provide to Australia' means 'Australia' in the broad geographical terms, but I am advised that the proposed new section 3 1 A will not cause any concern because the word 'Australia' in the sense of this Bill means the same as the word Commonwealth' meant in the old legislation.

* The proposed new section reads: 
The Road Transport **Federation** and its various affiliated bodies have sent me a great number of telegrams.

* I have telegrams from  Mr Dewey,  the  President  of the Bus Proprietors Association of New South Wales; from  Mr Cassell,  the Secretary of the Tasmanian Road Transport Association; from  Mr Bender,  the  Chairman  of the Passenger Division of the Australian Road Transport **Federation**;  B from  Mr Michael  Schrader, the Executive Director of the Bus Proprietors Association of Victoria; from  Mr Forbes,  the  President  of the Long Distance Road Transport Association of Australia; from  Mr 
Uniacke, the  President  of the Australian Road Transport **Federation**; and from  Mr McRae,  the  President  of the Master Carriers Association of New South Wales.

* This study was commissioned by the State Government of Tasmania and the **Federation** of Tasmanian Chambers of Commerce; it was published a month or so ago.

* ls it a fact that pilots in the future will only be able to obtain employment or maintain employment in the airline industry if they are  members  of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* Is the Tribunal, in its attitude to the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots and employers, giving the Guild the protection to which it is entitled under the Act.

* But if the Senate gives me that ground then I shall certainly also have reinforced grounds - grounds which have never been available in the 73 years of this **Federation** - as well as those for rejection of Bills for advising the Governor-General that there should be an election for the whole of the Senate as well.

* (Opposition members interjecting)- 
Protected areas, not likely to develop in the direction of separate political existence within the **federation** - for example, Norfolk Island and Cocos Island.

* I think the House would be interested to know the views on this matter of the official journal of the Australian Road **Federation**.

* The article states: 
That, as I say, is a quotation from the official organ of the Australian Road **Federation** magazine  Road News.

* I take as my point of departure a very clear statement of what the Government ought to be looking at, which has been enshrined in a note from the New South Wales **Federation** of Infant School Clubs, a copy of which several honourable members have received.

* It had this to say: 
Further on in the note the **Federation** had this to say: 
Some mention has been made of constitutional inadequacies.

* Australia is a **federation** similar to West Germany, the United States of America and other countries where the governments of those countries have complete power over the national economy.

* Prior to **Federation** there were no such sovereign rights given to any State by  Her  Majesty's Government, and it was not until after **Federation** and Australia had become an independent nation that these rights obviously were conferred on the independent nation of Australia.

* I do not take it any further except to say that I have checked and I believe that the vote by 18 members of the Opposition is the smallest opposition vote on a Budget Bill since **Federation**.

* These levels, which are marginally higher than the former maximum rates, were recommended some time ago by the Dairying Research Committee with the approval of the representatives of the Milk Producers Association of Australia and New Zealand and the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation**.

* These operative rates will be prescribed by regulation and may be varied by regulation after taking into account any recommendations made to me by the Australian Dairy Corporation after consultation with the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and any other organisations which may be appropriate.

* Of course, I must refer also to the bans imposed by members of the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation** on major building projects in Victoria.

* The range of properties includes a number transferred at **Federation**, pans of the Holsworthy Army Manoeuvre Area acquired in 1913, housing for Defence personnel, telephone exchanges (and extensions), post offices and an aerodrome.

* The Parliaments of the first decade of **Federation** continued the process.

* We now have a mature single national economy not the sort of loose congregation of several separate economies as was believed to have existed at the time of **Federation**.

* This scheme was brought about as a result of a conference, constituted back in 1965, known as the National Stevedoring Industry Conference, lt was made up of representatives from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority.

* All the employees now come under the one union, the Waterside Workers' **Federation**, which covers the coal handling and the general cargo sections.

* The Waterside Workers" **Federation** is not prepared to provide casual labour, it is not prepared to go back to the old system of paying attendance money, of hiring casual employees and so on now that there is permanency for employees on the waterfront.

* It is agreed by the employers of waterfront labour and by the Waterside Workers' **Federation** that this will at least give some chance to stabilise employment in this industry and to iron out many of the differences which have occurred in past years between waterfront labour and employers.

* What the Waterside Workers' **Federation** put forward was later justified in confer ences.

* On this matter I shall quote from a letter written by the Secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** to the Melbourne 'Age'.

* She said: 
This is not my opinion; it is the opinion of the Secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation**.

* The secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** said: 
The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  and the industry have had a difficult job because the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** changed its recommendations on what items should be included.

* The Minister for the Media knows perfectly well that the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations is, in its corporate sense, more than prepared to negotiate with him, to cooperate with him and to observe any standards which may be regarded as reasonable.

* He announced that he would not seek another term in the Parliament if the Parliament ran its full course., Last September, the Federal Executive of my Party expelled the Victorian Branch of the Party from the **federation** which comprises the 6 State branches.

* The American Supreme Court has held that if you approbate the convention for the purposes of dealing with other nations and therefore accept this 24 miles mark you cannot in terms of the components or the elements of the **federation** reject it.

* I would think it is the view of the average Australian- it is certainly the view of Opposition members- that the negotiations that were entered into by the Minister and the acquiescence that he gave to legislation which passed through the Queensland Parliament probably constituted one of the more shameful betrayals of Aboriginal hopes and aspirations that has taken place in Australia since **Federation**.

* But after all, we are living in a **federation** of States.

* Following representations by the **Federation** of Commercial Broadcasters, I arranged for the increased charges proposed from 1 October 1973 to be deferred for the time being in order to give the **Federation** the opportunity to submit a case for consideration on a selective basis according to the financial position ofindividual stations.

* and (3) I would expect these matters to be covered in some detail by the **Federation** and presented to me for consideration.

* If so, will he explain to this House his present attitude, if it has been changed, with respect to the Master Builders Association and the Builders Labourers **Federation**?

* To close the ALAO, as the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting, would deny to the people of Australia and in particular to those involved in the Australian **Federation** of Consumer Organisations -an organisation representing some 3.5 million people- the legal redress which the service currently offers.

* In the United States of America, a much older **federation** than ours and a **federation** where the States have greater financial powers or resources than the States have in this country, there is no question as regards securities and exchange matters, for instance.

* In January 1969 book manufacturing members of the Printing and Allied Trades Employers' **Federation** of Australia submitted a request for assistance to book manufacturers in Australia to the then Minister for Trade and Industry, the right honourable  Sir John  McEwen.

* The cold hard facts are that this is the quota which was recommended by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* I I believe that the **Federation** has acted very responsibly in its approach to wheat quotas.

* When the stocks of wheat held by the Australian Wheat Board were such as to cause concern the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, with commendable courage, recommended the introduction of a quota system.

* So in advocating an increased quota one has to consider what is in the best interests of the growers, and I am sure that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** had this very much in mind when it made its recommendation to increase the wheat quota.

* I have the very highest regard for the **Federation**'s judgment in this matter.

* With all due deference to the honourable member for Dawson, I would say that the **Federation** has the capacity, the facilities and the experience necessary to deal with this matterin the best interests of the Australian wheat grower.

* In the light of that experience I would say that the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** now has looked at these difficulties, and I hope that the honourable member for Dawson will agree that it was very good policy on the part of the Government to carry the wheat industry through that particular period of difficulty even if it involved guaranteeing the amount of money mentioned.

* We can only do our best, and I am sure that if this matter of wheat quotas is left in the capable hands of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** we will have the best chance of getting the best results for the Australian wheat grower, about whom I am mostly concerned.

* I believe that the action taken by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and by the Government on the advice of that body is the correct action and I go along with it completely.

* The handling of the whole situation from that dim dark period of a couple of years ago reflects credit on the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and on this Government for the policy it has adopted in making the position what it is today.

* I couple with that the very sound recommendations that have consistently been made to the Government by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* In the time remaining to me in this debate I wish to protest against the decision of the Department of Social Security to cease giving financial assistance to FILEF- the **Federation** of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Familieswhich does so much work among migrants of Italian origin in my own area.

* The facts are of course that since **federation** there was until about 1960 a very consistent philosophy behind electoral redistributions and mostly they stuck pretty close to the quotas- not completely, but in the redistributions over that period they kept pretty close to the quotas.

* When 
The provisions in this Bill also revise and update many of the penalties, some of which have remained unchanged since **Federation**.

* What happened at the last Teachers **Federation** congress at Adelaide?

* If the 20 per cent tolerance provided under the present Act - indeed since **federation** - violates a principle, then surely no-one will say that a 10 per cent tolerance does not violate the same principle of one vote one value.

* If at the time of **Federation** those who looked to the future felt that the small States mightbe in some peril at the hands of the predatory large States, today it is all the States who feel that they are in some peril at the hands of the predatory central government.

* Few thought at the time of Australia's **Federation** that the basic governing role of the States was in any real doubt.

* As I say ,there was remarkable prescience, but the fact remains that at **Federation** there was no thought that the States were in dire peril of their existence.

* Ma-ter Plumbers Association of Victoria, Building and Allied Trades Association, Terrazo and Paving Association of Victoria, Victorian Trades Hall Council, Australian Builders Labourers **Federation**, Building Workers' Industrial Union.

* This Conference was attended by representatives of the employer body covering the conventional and terminal areas, the National Industrial Council, by the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, the Australian National Line and officers of my Department, including a representative of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority.

* This is an entirely new concept and has the full support of the principal parties, including the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Committee will have corporate status but its members, to be drawn from the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, the Australian National Line and the Waterside Workers **Federation**, will not be full time functionaries.

* and (2) Additional to the public release of the Commonwealth/State/City pf Brisbane Advisory Committee's Report on Brisbane's future airport needs earlier this year, the Department has referred to all major aviation interests, including the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, a summary of all the factors which had to be considered in achieving a new safe airport concept for Brisbane.

* The official journal of the New South Wales **Federation** of Parents and Citizens Associations was accorded Category B classification.

* A number of representations were subsequently made by the **Federation** and on its behalf for the journal to be classified as Category A.

* My Department was unable to agree to so classify the journal ofthe **Federation** because if is not regarded for the purpose of postal registration as an educational organisation.

* However this step can be taken only on the recommendation of the Waterside Workers **Federation** or the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour.

* One cannot expect the **Federation** to take the step of asking for its members to be declared redundant for, after all, their unemployed members are being paid at the rate of approximately $3,000 a year to remain in the industry.

* One cannot expect the Waterside Workers **Federation** to ask for its members to be declared redundant when they are enjoying these remarkably favourable conditions.

* The first is that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority should have the authority of declaring people to be redundant without the advice of the Waterside Workers **Federation** or the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour.

* Obviously the **Federation** will not do so for reasons that one can understand.

* This is composed essentially of the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, so it will be somewhat like Caesar appealing to Caesar.

* I hope the Minister will not depend on receiving the kind of objective advice from the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation** that he would hope to get.

* It can be understood why the **Federation** is hoping to continue with the present situation.

* If the money cannot be obtained in that way the **Federation** aims a few carefully located kicks in the stomach and that usually induces the employers to give the waterside workers what they want.

* It was greeted without enthusiasm by the Australian Teachers **Federation**.

* On 3 1 December there will come to a close the reign of the ninth Clerk of the House since **Federation**.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, a body to which the honourable member for Moore gave many years of distinguished service, maintained that a bounty was preferable to a tariff because users of machinery covered by the Tariff Board reference were in the main exporting production.

* In the report to which I referred the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** assessed the cost in producing a bushel of wheat attributable to the cost of farm machinery as 12c to 15c.

* He had talks with the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** with that end in view.

* This is a matter that  growers'  own representatives, through the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, took up.

* The plan to cope with the situation was put to the Minister by the growers themselves through their own organisation - the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* If this could have been done more quickly I believe that it would have been done; but every effort was made by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** to get a plan to this Government to restrict production as soon as they could when it became evident to them that there would be a need for reduction.

* Before this was evident any reduction would certainly not have been accepted by the Australian wheat growers or by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The winning team was the Communist-controlled Waterside Workers **Federation** team.

* Who do you think presented the cup to the Communist official of that **Federation**?

* After more than 60 years of **federation** we find that our public servants still have the same amount of annual leave.

* The representations were sent by the Parents and Friends **Federation** of Victoria.

* I think the **Federation** put the matter fairly and squarely in perspective, and it has I think given a completely and wholly satisfactory answer to the allegation that the Government is already under the present system paying far too much to independent schools.

* They will continue to be deprived until the Commonwealth accepts in the Australian **federation** the degree of responsibility that is accepted by the Federal Administration in the United States, or the Federal  Government in Canada or in West Germany.

* Iti this **federation**, the amount of resources in the financial sense available to the Federal authorities is very much greater than that available to the federal authorities in West Germany, Canada or the United States.

* Indeed, each year the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, which has been responsible for the establishment of wheat quotas, has I believe taken a very responsible attitude both in accepting the necessity for quotas and then in recommending a level of quotas which is related to seasonal conditions, to the traditional position of those who have always been wheat growers and alsoto market opportunities for the sale of wheat.

* In addressing the annual conference of the Australian Road Transport **Federation** in New Zealand on 25 September, having referred to the $33m being provided by this Bill, he referred to the States.

* I want to come now to the revenue sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States under the federalism arrangements which have ensured that the States have been given the greatest amounts of money in the history of **Federation**.

* The National Industrial Council, which represents the two employer groups involved, that is, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and the Terminal and Depot Employers **Federation**, submitted that the industry should be free of governmental control, as did the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* On the other hand the employers, as represented by the National Industrial Council and the Waterside Workers **Federation**, believe that this problem can be overcome by agreement between them.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** has not put forward a proposal publicly but is aware of the problem and the effect it has on costs.

* However, the Waterside Workers **Federation** is adamant that one alternative it will not accept is a return to the pool system because that is what had operated up till 1967 and that is what they and the employers were anxious to get away from.

* Most of the organisations that sought a statutory corporation also sought restoration of the rights of employers of compulsory redundancy, but that is totally opposed by the Waterside Workers **Federation** and is not proposed by the National Industrial Council which instead put forward a proposal for early retirement.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** in particular saw it as an additional hindrance to its aim of improving the welfare of its members and were, indeed still are, particularly resentful at the role the ASAI played in inflicting penalties on wharfies that were harsher than any that applied to other workers throughout the nation under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* I ask the House to look at the Bill in this way: We have heard a great deal about the need for the States and the Commonwealth to get together to agree, but if this Bill is considered as affecting people wherever they live, let us take our minds back to the time of **Federation**.

* It was hard argument that created this great **Federation** and this great nation.

* This is what I want to see for the people of Western Australia and that is why it seems fundamental to me that, when we live in a **federation** which is a **federation** of people as much as of States, those people should have a say in the wealth that is produced from the sea bed that lies off their shore.

* As I indicated, under section 5 of the Act, the intent of the Grants Commission is to provide a means whereby there shall be at least the opportunity of equality as between the States within the **Federation**.

* Approximately 30 Waterside Workers **Federation** members are currently employed by the Fremantle Port Authority as crane drivers.

* While they are members of the **Federation** they are in the unusual position of not being registered waterside workers.

* The conditions of their employment have been the subject of direct agreement between the Fremantle Port Authority and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** has long sought the registration as waterside workers of these members without loss to them of their separate long service leave and pension entitlements.

* In 1973 the Port Authority and the **Federation** agreed in principle on an arrangement which provided that crane drivers would become registered waterside workers and retain their separate long service leave and pension entitlements.

* The Bill has been sought by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the Fremantle Port Authority and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

The existing dairy research scheme covers research financed by levies on butter, cheese, butter oil, butter powder and ghee.

* The Wholemilk Conference of the Australian Dairy Fanners **Federation** took the initiative in the discussions within the industry which led to the present proposals.

* The proposals were endorsed by State bodies of the **Federation**.

* I will be consulting the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and the Milk Producers Association.

* The previous day - on the Monday - at a meeting of the 7 Treasurers of this country, the heads of the 7 governments in our **Federation**, there was a lengthy discussion of the economic situation.

* How valid are these discussions on the economy when information on prices is denied to the partners in the **Federation**?

* It is a view which we think is entirely responsible and consonant with preserving a proper balance between the roles of the Commonwealth Government and of the State governments in this **federation**.

* The history of the Australian **Federation** during the past 10 years has been one of a gradual transfer of power from the States to the Federal Government, yet during that period of time that transfer of power has on no occasion been facilitated by an amendment to the Constitution, except in respect of the referendum to give the Commonwealth power over Aboriginal affairs.

* The experience of the States during the past decade in the Australian **Federation** is that whilst they have been left with de jure responsibility for particular areas of government services, because of their financial starvation they have been forced again and again to hand powers over to the Federal Government.

* The real issue is whether in 1975 all political parties in Australia are prepared to accept that we are a **federation**, that we are going to remain a **federation**, and that we are not going to effectively solve many of the great social and economic problems we have unless there is an effective partnership between the Commonwealth and the States.

* Above all our policy towards federalism is this: It is all very well legally to divide power and responsibility in a **federation** but unless you give to each of the elements of government in a **federation** financial power to discharge their responsibilities the legal division will be illusionary and a fiction in many cases.

* To his great credit, the honourable member for Cowper with members of the Miners **Federation** attended a meeting in January 1975 to discuss the future of Nymboida colliery On page 14 of this book it says: 
In January 1975 **Federation** efforts around Nymboida included another in a series of visits there by the Northern District  president  Bill Chapman and vice  president  Jim Hayes, this time with District secretary Ken Fogg.

* Fortunately the coal produced from Nymboida, which mine is being owned and run by the Miners **Federation**, is being consumed by a power station in the Grafton region.

* There would be no chance of the Miners **Federation** getting its hands on the rich coal deposits at Warkworth because it Will be almost as profitable as Utah's resources at Blackwater in central Queensland.

* Greater encouragement and inspiration should be given to those ISO miners and to the Miners **Federation**.

* The **Federation** was able to keep the 150 men employed.

* If it is too late now I hope that at some later date this colliery which has kept 1 50 men off the dole in Grafton Will, with the concurrence of every honourable member in the Parliament be exempt from the 5c a tonne levy because of what the men and the Miners **Federation** have achieved.

* It is to the great credit of the Miners **Federation** that it was able to take this mine over from private enterprise and keep it working successfully.

* Almost since **Federation** the public servants of Australia have worked less than 40 hours a week.

* The International Air Pilots' **Federation** has granted Brisbane international airport an orange star, which means that it is not up to the standard of other international airports around Australia.

* The **Federation** has done this because of the situation of the instrument landing system.

* I believe he will be regarded by historians as the greatest statesman this country has seen since **Federation**, indeed if not one of our greatest ever.

* I understand that the Pilots **Federation** has an international agreement that international flights will not operate on domesticroutes and that domestic operators will not operate on international routes.

* If Air New Zealand is not sufficiently interested to operate such a service, I believe that the Government of New Zealand is in no position to say that 
I would like to give voice to something which I believe the Miners **Federation** would like me to say.

* The Miners **Federation** had bestowed upon him life membership of its worthy organisation.

* Both the Australian Society of Authors and the Australian **Federation** of Authors have appealed to the Government to protect the separate identity of the public lending right.

* This right was granted to Australian authors and publishers by the previous Government, and is the greatest benefit Australian authors have received from any Government since **Federation** .

* The members of the Textile Council of Australia are listed as being the Cotton and Manmade Fibres **Federation**, the Cotton and Allied Textile Manufacturers Association of Australia, the Wool Textile Manufacturers of Australia, the Australian Knitting Industries Council, the Australian Wool Board, the Carpet Manufacturers **Federation** of Australia, Courtaulds (Australia) Ltd and Fibremakers Ltd.

* Of 26 proposed amendments put .to the people since **Federation** only five have met these requirements.

* In fact, had these provisions applied since **federation** only 2 additional referendums would have been carried.

* It is, in the Committee's opinion, more in accord with democratic principle and the developments since **Federation** that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one half of the number of States.

* Councillor Caterson, I think, is secretary of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, or something of that nature.

* I take solace in looking at the matter of CommonwealthState relations in this way- and bear in mind that they are the kinds of relationships that have bedevilled every government since **Federation**.

* and if we do anything which may put them into a difficult position they will feel inclined to curse rather than to bless **Federation**.

* This has happened ever since **Federation**.

* It became obvious a few years after **Federation** that the less populous States, namely, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia needed extra Commonwealth financial assistance.

* The Commission very early rejected arguments that special grants should be based on the principle of compensation for disabilities resulting from **Federation**, for poverty of resources or for inequalities among individual citizens.

* Instead it adopted the following criteria: 
Special grants are justified when a State, through financial stress from any cause, is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the **Federation** and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States.

* Queenslanders are paying dearly to be pan of the Australian **federation** .

* I for one, as a member of the Australian Government, exhort and implore him to break his silence and to tell the Australian people exactly his reasoning and his motives in dismissing the worst government since **Federation**.

* When I used the strong language to which the Minister referred I was quoting from the major incident report of the Australian Parachute **Federation**, and one cannot get more than factual than that.

* The Minister expressly said: 
The Department has always found the **Federation** to be a responsible body, and this is borne out by its actions following this accident.

* The Minister tabled a letter from the APF to all safety officers of the **Federation**.

* It states: 
It is important to note that the very letter which the Minister quoted shows that what I had said in the grievance debate was quite factual and that the warning of this established pattern of conduct had not been heeded by the **Federation** until the fatalities occurred.

* The departmental officer- himself a parachutist- was staying at the camping area but he took no action to ground the pilot, nor did the **Federation** take any action to ground the pilot.

* It is important to note that the Department has the power to ground the pilot as a pilot, but the **Federation** has the power to ground him only as a parachutist.

* The Vice-President of the **Federation** in the 'Age' of 14 February has also confirmed that that is so.

* The **Federation** cannot discipline its members and it is necessary to establish regulations by some other machinery for continuous enforcement.

* -Clause 16 has particular relevance to the application of the Master Builders Association of New South Wales for the deregistration of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers **Federation** in the Australian Industrial Court.

* I think we ought to recall the way in which  Mr Justice  Smithers summarised the actions of the Builders Labourers **Federation** at that time.

* it is as though the **Federation** converts the expression ' Have gun will travel ' to ' Have power will ban '.

* Secretary of the Hospital Employees **Federation** of Australia, Victorian No.

* Keith Mitchell Secretary Hospital Employees **Federation** of Australia Victorian Number One Branch  lt was not Keith Mitchell to whom 1 was referring.

* I would hope that the trade unions, which have indicated through the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation** that they recognise that productivity is most important, would improve the atmosphere.

* My friend, the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  made the comment that the work of the High Court was more complex today than it was at the time of **Federation**.

* Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia Merchant Service Guild of Australia Operative Painters and Decorators Union of Australia Operative Plasterers' and Plaster Workers' **Federation** of Australia 
I rise to support this Bill.

* The proposal for this levy has been supported by the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council, the Meat and Allied Trades **Federation** and the Australian Meatworks Federal Council.

* Whilst many employers, perhaps most employers, are happy to discuss and settle their problems and disputes at conferences around their office tables with union representatives, this does not suit the Employers **Federation** which, a. few years ago, waved a very big stick indeed in no uncertain manner and practically dictated to the employers what they should or should not do.

* The progress which the unions are making is really worrying the Employers **Federation**.

* It is very worried about the fact that wage settlements which the **Federation** strongly opposes are being made outside the industrial tribunals, thus setting precedents for use successfully in arguments against the **Federation**, in cases involving the very large companies which still allow the **Federation** to handle their affairs.

* The climb to power by the Labor Party started in 1966, the year in which Harold Holt led the Liberal and  Country  Parties to the greatest victory of any Australian government since **Federation**.

* Australian **federation** such as we have today.

* Over a 12-month period wages and awards for members of the Builders Labourers **Federation** have gone up 36 per cent; for butchers 25 per cent; for carpenters 32 per cent; for public service clerks 38 per cent; for council workers 28 per cent; for postmen 39 per cent; and for storemen 35 per rent.

* Builders Labourers **Federation** which wants to re-open negotiations on its award.

* A Press report on this matter states: 
The Builders Labourers **Federation** -  had ignored the process of conciliation and arbitration.

* Neither the Minister for Labor and Immigration, nor the Prime Minister, nor any other Minister is prepared to tackle the Builders Labourers **Federation** or John Halfpenny of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union.

* The Government says nothing of the Builders Labourers **Federation** and its guerrilla tactics.

* I regret that the Press in Victoria and, as far as 1 am aware, throughout Australia has said nothing about the highly responsible attitude recently shown by the Waterside 
Workers **Federation** in Melbourne.

* There were members in the Melbourne branch who were obviously dissatisfied with breaking that agreement because over recent years the **Federation** has changed its record in relation to agreements and has done much more to keep agreements than at any previous time in its history.

* That was a highly responsible attitude in the present circumstances and the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers **Federation** deserves commendation for it.

* It is time the Government not only practised restraint on its own account through the measures I have mentioned through the course of these remarks and established restraint in other sections of the community but also used its links with the Australian Council of Trade Unions to see that the Builders Labourers **Federation** cannot get away with its claimed guerilla tactics, to see that the Amalgamated Metalworkers Union will not be successful- 
Let us look at what used to be the position of the Australian Medical Association when I went through my medical course.

* The Labor Party health committee has received a deputation from the **Federation** of Private Hospital Proprietors.

* Of a total of  7  executive members of the **Federation**,  4  or  5  are medical practitioners.

* We know that the doctor who is  president  of the **Federation** of Private Hospital Proprietors is the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of the Australian Capital Territory.

* Doctors and the health insurance funds participate in the attack on the Labor Party scheme, and often they overlap in that the same people are involved on behalf of both the doctors and the funds in the publication of such things as the 'AMA News', the 'AMA Gazette', the Health Care Finance' publications and the 
The honourable gentleman says that it was the view of the founders of **Federation** that the Territories should be regarded in the same respect as the States.

* To say that it was the intention of the founders of **Federation** that the Territories should be represented on the same basis as the States or as new States is to do history a dreadful disservice.

* In return for the granting of those conditions it is proposed that an agreement will be signed by the employers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers **Federation** which will provide that during the course of the agreement, which will run for 2 years from 6th May 1970, the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the Australian Council of Trade Unions undertake that there will be no stoppages of work on the waterfront over any issue of wages and conditions negotiated during these negotiations.

* As I understand the position, the Waterside Workers **Federation** submitted that its members were subject to shifts and therefore should get an extra week's leave, making a total of 4 weeks.

* Many organisations made submissions on the Bill and my officers and I have had useful and wide ranging discussions with a number of individuals and organisations, including the Australian Finance Conference, the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies, the Council of Authorised Money Market Dealers, the Accepting Houses Association and the Australian **Federation** of Credit Union Leagues.

* A lockout does not exist between Trans-Australia Airlines and the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots.

* Members of the **Federation** can return to work whenever they are ready to commence duty on condition, of course, that they give an undertaking that they will continue to work and not place the travelling public in the invidious position of first buying a ticket and then of being transported if the pilots elect to remain at work that day.

* If the **Federation** is so concerned about his future employment then I inform it that there is a job for him at TAA in a nonliving capacity.

* I regret the abolition of the division of Lang, which was an original electorate at **Federation**.

* Under the Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments increasingly the procedure has been evolved for saying that negotiations between Federal and State Ministers within the Australian **federation** must be confidential; that members of Parliament are not entitled to know what is being proposed.

* Before he went to China in July last, the Leader of the Opposition told a meeting of the Australian University Liberal **Federation** in Melbourne that a Liberal government would renew relations with Taiwan.

* So, we see  Mr W.  N. Hogan,  President  of the Australian Farmers **Federation**, reported in this morning's 'Sydney Morning Herald' as saying that the public should not be deluded that the Country Party is a champion of rural industry.

* The Australian Council of the Aging, the Pensioners **Federation**, Professor Henderson and all the local government bodies are protesting.

* The principle of selective underwriting has been accepted by the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** and the Australian Dairy Industry Conference.

* It is the expression of opinion of  Mr Price,  the leader of the Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* In this regard I refer to statements made by the Tasmanian Farmers **Federation** on behalf of the island.

* The Tasmanian Farmers **Federation** points out that following the Federal Government's decision to phase out the dairy bounty over the next 3 years the Minister for Primary Industry has suggested that special assistance may be given to dairy farmers to make their units a more productive and profitable enterprise.

* The **Federation** also pointed out that the Minister said that additional funds would be made available for the marginal dairy farmer reconstruction scheme.

* I refer again to the submission toy the Tasmanian Farmers **Federation** which indicates that the Minister has stated that it is his intention to investigate this matter and that some money will be made available to help to convert cream producers to whole milk production.

* I have here a letter from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation** dated 27 February 1974 which states: 
I thank the honourable gentlemen opposite for the notification that the Bill will not pass the Senate, because tomorrow I will be speaking to the members of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission, which I had hoped would become the Schools Commission.

* Other members will be  Mrs J.  Blackburn, now senior lecturer at the Sturt College of Advanced Education in Adelaide and who for many years was connected with teacher education; the Director-General of Education in South Australia,  Mr A.  W. Jones; Father Martin, director of the Catholic Education Office, Melbourne;  Dr Peter  Tannock, Dean of the Faculty of Education of the University of Western Australia, who also is on the Roman Catholic Archbishop's trustee board or whatever it is called, for education in Western Australia;  Mr Ray  Costello, the  President  of the Australian Teachers **Federation**;  Mrs J.  Kirner,  President  of the Victorian **Federation** of State School Mothers Clubs;  Mr A.  McNamara, the  President  of the Sydney **Federation** of Catholic Parents and Friends Associations;  Mr Peter  Moyes, the Principal of the Christ Church Grammar School in Western Australia; and  Mr A.  D. J.

* For example, in the United States of America- a **federation** quite similar to ours- there is a National Traffic Act and a National Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

* In turning back the clock this conservative Government is turning its back on social responsibilities that successive federal governments, irrespective of political complexion, have seen fit to support since **Federation**.

* The Master Builders **Federation** of Australia has asked for a compulsory levy amounting to 0.1% to be placed on builders.

* I suggest that that is not only an insult to  Mr Justice  Wilson, it is also an insult to the smaller States in the Australian **Federation**.

* For example, in an article appearing in the Melbourne  Age  on 22 May, the dean of the law faculty of the University of Western Australia,  Dr A.  F. Dickey said: 
There has been ... a persistent sense that since Australia is a **federation** and since one of the most important aspects of the High Court's work is the resolution of Federal Constitutional issues, it would be at least fitting that judicial representation on the court should be more widespread.

* Essentially we must recognise that this is a **federation** and in a **federation** it is not for a federal government to say what it is about to do without being sure that it is able to do so through its constitutional and legislative capacity.

* Consultations have been held with Market Milk Authorities and the Australian Dairy Farmers' **Federation**.

* Moreover, the role of the Government in this area certainly has become more significant in recent years than at any time since **federation**.

* New South Wales Teachers ' **Federation** Health Society 
We emphasise that the existing Act has a remarkable record when judged against this standard.

* It dates back virtually to the beginning of our Australian **Federation**.

* The onus therefore lies very much with the Government to explain why these principles are wrong now if they were right then and have remained right throughout more than 70 years of **Federation**.

* Firstly, the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr McEwen)  spoke to the Australian Farmers **Federation** about the very serious position of the Australian wool industry.

* the Australian Postgraduate **Federation** of Medicine, the College of Radiologists of Australasia, the Australian College of General Practitioners and the College of Pathologists of Australia, where the gift is for the purpose of eduction or research in medical knowledge or science; 
Having made those brief comments and without any malice aforethought, and despite the fact that I hope to be elected as a patron of a pet organisation in southern Tasmania with some members who care about donkeys, I am going to turn from the donkey walloper and from his performance last night.

* I just want to say,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  that what has been done for Tasmania by the present Federal Government exceeds by a mile anything that has been done for our State in 79 years of **federation**.

* The Board, as is its usual practice, had already Invited a number of organisations, including the appropriate unions to submit their views and it will be meeting with the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations later this year, to discuss with that body (as it is required to do under the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Acf) the introduction of revised requirements.

* The AEWL did not consult me, nor did the Stevedoring Industry Council, the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Australian Wool Industry Conference was established by the two federal woolgrower organisations in Australia, the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**.

* The Conference comprises 25 members each from the Council and the **Federation** and an independent Chairman.

* As to the honourable member's comments in relation to the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** laying down conditions for the contribution of funds, he is only partly right.

* It is true that the **Federation** was somewhat divided as to whether it should, firstly, enter the field by making additional funds available and, secondly, enter the actual properties in order to make an investigation.

* I am informed by a very reliable source that 90 per cent of the members of the **Federation** supported this principle.

* However, the Bill makes provision for a figure lower than the 15c, namely 11c, but that rate can be increased to 15c after discussion between the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  and the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**.

* The people of the separate States joined in a **federation** at the turn of the century to become one nation for a very large number of good reasons.

* policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' **Federation**, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

* Also in this morning's  Australian Financial Review  Mr Des  Foster, the Federal Director of the **Federation** of Australian Radio Broadcasters, is reported as saying this: 
There is other circumstantial evidence to indicate that  Mr Elliott  is indeed correct.

* But the Minister's statements seem to be odd and contradictory, because 5 days later in front of the same correspondent on 10 September, in discussing matters relating to the Waterside Workers **Federation**, the Minister first of all said: 
For the uninitiated, the Minister was referring to Charley Fitzgibbon of the Waterside Workers **Federation** - .

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** is a corporate body.

* It is my contention and my ruling that a discussion of matters relating to payments being made to the Waterside Workers **Federation** would be out of order.

* The terms of reference, as I hope you correctly say, cover the Waterside Workers **Federation** as well.

* The point that I was making was that there is significant evidence in  Mr Elliott's  statement of the activities of the Seamen's Union and in other published reports that the Minister had approved indemnity payments not only concerning the Seamen's Union but also concerning the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The Minister there would indicate a knowledge and an approval of what was happening in the Waterside Workers **Federation** just as  Mr Elliott  claimed that he had approved what was happening in relation to the Seamen's Union.

* I venture to suggest that a great number of people throughout Australia have been extremely grateful over the past 2'/2 years that we have had the Constitution Act of 1 90 1 because if we had not we aU know very well that the legal balance which still exists between the Federal Government and the State governments in our **Federation** would have been greatly disturbed.

* Of course one could always improve on the basic document of our **Federation**.

* 1 ) Does he support the request by the **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations for an inquiry into tertiary education.

* What is his attitude to the **Federation**'s view that there should be a single national body to co-ordinate tertiary education.

* Was a request made that in the interest of Italian-Australian friendship the deportation order be withdrawn and the case reexamined in the light of the fact that the action taken is regarded as offensive to the Italian community in Australia and having regard to the value of  Mr Salemi  's work in the Italian community on behalf of the **Federation** of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families?

* At the time of **Federation** the areas now known as the Northern Territory and the Austraiian Capital Territory were respectively part of South Australia and New South Wales and the people then living there were able to vote in referendums.

* -The House will be aware that bans imposed by the Australian Builders Labourers **Federation** on major building projects in Victoria are costing thousands of jobs at a time when the unemployment rate is relatively high, and when jobs could otherwise be immediately available on projects involving some $500m worth of investment.

* I am informed that 40 men duly turned up at the site but were met by an organiser from the Builders Labourers **Federation** who informed them that no work was to take place.

* Nothing could give a clearer indication of the very deep feeling among the rank and file members of Builders Labourers **Federation** against the totally irresponsible and destructive actions of their union leaders.

* They have expressed their opinion when given an opportunity to do so and they have reiterated that opinion despite the presence of a Builders Labourers **Federation** organiser who attempted to intimidate them out of voting to return to work.

* I have no doubt that the actions of the Builders Labourers **Federation** officials will be taken into account by the Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when he hears this case.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia has claims before the national conference of parties interested in the stevedoring industry.

* I am informed that last week the Federal Council of the Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia met in Sydney and there passed a resolution, the tenor of which I believe to be a recommendation that there be an all-port national stoppage commencing on 21st March to pursue these claims, and further that when the stoppage occurs on 21st March there not be another meeting of the Waterside Workers **Federation** branches in each of those ports until 25th March; which means that there will be a 5-day all-port stoppage throughout Australia.

* I am bound to say that I deprecate the possibility that there will be stoppages of this magnitude - with their obvious harm to Australian industry, commerce and the general welfare of the people - while claims are before the national conference, which has the support of all parties including the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the employers.

* I can only say that I do deprecate very greatly the possibility of this direct action in this manner at a time when claims are before the national conference, which has the support of all parties including the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* In anticipation of this matter arising I did write a letter on, 1 think, 26th February to the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions drawing his attention to the way in which things were shaping and asking him to use all the power he possesses to ensure that wiser counsel will prevail in the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* This is a **federation**, and the voice of the Queensland Government, and of any other State government for that matter, should be heard in matters that effect their State.

* Only five of 32 proposals had been accepted over the previous history of **federation** and then in one go three of four proposals were accepted.

* I cannot give precise dates at this point but - 
As I understand it, the Australian Dairy Farmers **Federation** has been concerned to see that the results of research are made available more quickly than has been the case in the past.

* In fact, there has been pressure at each meeting of the **federation** that reports on all research projects should be provided with funds supplied by the research levy - the levy we are going to increase - and that the report should contain a brief description of each project, the status of the project, whether it has been completed, abandoned, deferred or is still continuing, and if abandoned or deferred the reason for such action.

* I want to say something now about what to me is probably the most important development in Australia since **Federation**, and that is the general desire in local government for the expansion of the concept of regionalism.

* The Australian Treasury in its 1973 submission to the Grants Commission stated: 
One of the complaints of the States with the presently proposed act is that State boundaries revert to what they were alleged to be at **Federation**.

* Presently accepted methods of determining State boundaries as used by the Division of National Mapping show the States to have more territory than they had at **Federation** - mainly because of the increased closing distance now used to close off internal waters, and because some areas, such as Wollongong, Portland, etc., have been built up since then.

* As a government we would propose that the State boundaries as shown on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act should be the ones used in the mining code of the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill, and we would make certain that jetties, piers, etc., built by the States since **Federation**, would remain State property.

* When that is done the Commonwealth will probably cease to be a **federation** and will be converted into a state that is national in form and structure and national in organisation.

* To me co-operative federalism implies that there must be sympathy and understanding between the Commonwealth and the States, the other constituent parts of the **federation**.

* All I am submitting is that the co-operation that is necessary for the smooth working of our **federation** has been severely weakened by the action that has been taken in this matter.

* The second thing which is significant is that because we have a federal system this ham-handed sort of play that has been allowed to continue has breached the relationships that ought to prevail between the centre and the component parts of a **federation**.

* In a letter to the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners **Federation** in ' October 1968 he said: 
I thank the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  for his great courtesy in allowing me to speak.

* He suggested that they can be led by the nose, that they have no minds of their own and that they are led like a blind dog by a communist leader in the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The other members of the Council will be the elected office holders of: The Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies, the Australian Bankers' Association, the Housing Industry Association, the Master Builders' **Federation** of Australia, the Real Estate Institute of Australia, and the Urban Development Institute of Australia.

* Is the Minister aware that the Australian **Federation** of Police Unions recently passed a resolution calling on all members of this Parliament, both Government and Opposition, to assist police to maintain law and order in the light of the growing tendency to resort to organised violence at demonstrations in the streets and in other places?

* -The Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots had a claim before  Mr Justice  Coldham, sitting as the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal, several months ago.

* After discussions with the representatives of the Australian **Federation** of Air Pilots, he described the pilots' claim as mischievous, illegitimate and a monstrous exercise in industrial power.

* He advised the **Federation** to lift the bans that it had imposed on Alice Springs in order to preserve the pilots' image.

* When I tell the Parliament that Captain Smithwell, in a conversation with me on Sunday, said that the **Federation** would prefer to see Connair go to the wall rather than give in on this it will understand the sense of dismay I have in dealing with this whole matter.

* If the **Federation** is not prepared to accept that decision, it ought to work up another case entirely and put it through the proper conciliation and arbitration system.

* The **Federation** should not be allowed to destroy an enterprise like Connair that has been in existence for such a long time.

* Apparently it was stated by the **Federation** yesterday or today that it intends to extend the ban to Darwin as from midnight tomorrow night and back into Alice Springs again on Friday.

* If this does not work, I am told, the **Federation** will call a national strike of all air pilots next week.

* I hope that the rest of the airline pilots in Australia will see what the **Federation** is doing to the image of pilots throughout Australia and will not agree to the proposal to proceed with a national strike.

* We have seen Prime Ministers such as Bruce, Scullin, Lyons, Menzies, Curtin, and Chifley, and here have been the great battles of politics over the greatest period of Australia's early history, with the exception of that first 26 years since **Federation**.

* The indulgent nature of these conditions is a salient indication of the extent of the weakness of the employers, vis a vis the bargaining power of the Waterside Worders **Federation**, the degree to which wages and salaries are a major cost factor and the extent to which they have added to our inflationary experience.

* Concessions in wages and conditions of the magnitude which the Waterside Workers **Federation** and stevedoring employers - we are critical of both bodies - have negotiated outside the conciliation and arbitration system have posed particular problems in the industry and have added significant burdens to freight costs.

* On the one hand the **Federation** has been able to exploit a monopoly of labour in the industry with the prospect of direct action if its major claims are not conceded.

* In this context, sources close to the industry have revealed that the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the employers of waterside labour are about to announce an agreement whereby the loading on annual leave for waterside workers will be increased from 17i per cent to 224 per cent.

* It is a matter which commands the attention of the Minister for Labour because he knows that the Waterside Workers **Federation** has become a vehicle, along with certain other maritime unions, whereby minority elements within the trade union movement have sought to convert industrial power into political action.

* The Minister should know full well that the former Government was prepared to be as critical of the employers on the waterfront as it was of the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* They were discussions but they were conducted under a measure of duress with the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation** and with the members of the Australian Agricultural Council.

* Although the Government can claim that this wheat legislation was negotiated with and finally approved by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation**, there is no doubt in the mind of every wheat grower in Australia that it was a very unsatisfactory set of negotiations.

* I do not think it is unfair to say that the Wheatgrowers' **Federation** was bullied and cajoled generally with threats of intimidation and references to the Industries Assistance Commission and all sorts of other alternatives to the point where it had no alternative but to accept the proposals put to it by the Australian Government.

* The **Federation**, of course, was told to accept this proposal or there would be no stabilization scheme or that the scheme would have to go, if there was to be one at all, to the Industries Assistance Commission.

* It was for that reason and in spite of very real objections by some members of the **Federation** that the **Federation** finally accepted the proposals.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill this House (1) expresses its concern at the arbitrary nature of discussions with the Australian Wheat **Federation** and Agricultural Council on details of the new stabilisation proposals, and (2) because of industrial disruption beyond the control of the industry, deplores the Government's failure to take the action necessary to enable pool payments foreshadowed for the 1973-74 crop to be made to growers.'

* It is an economic body which always deserves a quite special tribute because there is no other institution or economic mechanism like it in any other **federation** in the world and there is no other economic mechanism anywhere in the world which has been so successful, by its efforts, by its advice and by its investigations, in developing horizontal equality among the various parts of a nation.

* The public at large tends to look at the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation** and to say that it is to blame.

* Whilst the major debate and discussion about the cost of labour and the conditions that should apply for the next two years started with the Australian Waterside Workers **Federation**, that disruption flowed on to many other uinons and stoppages, disputes and disruption occurred- the public generally thinking that it was caused by the waterside workers.

* When one hears the secretary of that **Federation** say that there should be only one union servicing the waterfront one is inclined to agree with him for the sake of industrial peace and sensible decision-making.

* The Australian Teachers' **Federation** was consulted on this issue.

* My Department has met with the Australian Teachers **Federation** and at those meetings there have been representatives of the New South Wales Teachers **Federation**, the South Australian Institute of Teachers, and the Darwin Teachers Association.

* We have regarded the Australian Teachers **Federation** as playing a co-ordinating role in relation to the views of these organisations, and have had the benefit of their advice on a number of matters.

* I should like to express my appreciation of the **Federation**'s help.

* I am pleased that we have been able to agree with the **Federation** that the appropriate arbitral tribunal for members of the Commonwealth Teaching Service would be the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* We have also been able to accept suggestions of the **Federation** on certain clauses relating to discipline.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** has made a number of other suggestions relating to the legislation to which it has not been possible to agree in full.

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** believes that the Service should be administered by a commission of 3 members, one of whom would be elected by the teachers.

* It seems to us that the **Federation**'s proposal is inappropriate to the Commonwealth situation in which the .

* The Australian Teachers **Federation** has also suggested that the Commonwealth Teaching Service Commissioner should be assisted by a recognised advisory council representing all sections of the community.

* However, I do not think that an advisory council of the type1 suggested by the **Federation** would be appropriate for the administration of this Teaching Service.

* Australian Teachers **Federation** believes that open advertisements, that is, advertisements inside and outside the Service, should be resorted to only when no member of the Service is suitably qualified or experienced for the position.

* The **Federation** believes also that the Commissioner should be restricted specifically to employing qualified teachers.

* Another suggestion by the Australian Teachers **Federation** was that the Bill make specific provision for the establishment of a promotions committee.

* In the **Federation**'s view such a committee would have teacher representation on it.

* The **Federation** would also wish that, in making promotions, greater weight be given to seniority.

* He has expressed the view that in the long term Australia's security is less assured now than at almost any other time since **Federation**.

* Has the Minister seen the report attributed to the  President  of the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters in which he stated that 'increased interest in radio by government, trade unions and other groups was damaging their industry'?

* Have pilots of Ansett Airlines of Australia refused to fly with several other pilots unless they join the Air Pilots **Federation**, although these pilots are already members of the Pilots Guild which is a registered union.

* I point out that every **federation** which attends an international conference always has the problem - whether it is dealing with laws concerning discrimination on the ground of race, whether it is dealing with an International Labour Organisation Convention, or some other matter - that when it gets home the States will have to implement part of what it has agreed to.

* I refer the PostmasterGeneral to a recent statement by the **Federation** of Commercial Television Stations expressing the view that colour television transmission should not be introduced for some 5 years.

* The initial proposals for this levy were submitted by the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council and fully supported by the Meat and Allied Trades **Federation** and the Australian Meatworks' Federal Council.

* I am pleased to tell the House that the Customs Bureau has had detailed consultation with the Customs Agents **Federation** and that a detailed indication has been given to the **federation** of a procedure which will be adopted to accommodate examples where a genuine attempt has been made to comply with the terms of the new system of valuation but where, through no fault of those importers who are endeavouring to comply with it, some incorrect statement of value has been made.

* Those procedures have been explained in detail to the **federation** in a letter from the Comptroller of Customs.

* The Prime Minister has to his great record in less than 2 years a string of achievements for the trade union movement which is without parallel in the history of **Federation**.

* But the same Minister, in the middle of last year when it was brought to his notice that the Builders Labourers **Federation** was frightening people out of the High Court, took no action.

* Because the very detailed information sought by the honourable member was not immediately available to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, it was necessary for the Board to obtain information from the two industry bodies- the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the **Federation** of Australian Commercial Broadcasters.

* I can assure honourable members that the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** endorse the terms of the Wheat Trade Convention.

* The  Chairman  and the General Manager of the Wheat Board and the  President  of the Wheatgrowers' **Federation** attended the Geneva conference and participated fully in the negotiations.

* The Commonwealth from the outset indicated to the States that it would meet the full costs of any legal challenge in the High Court of Australia which is the supreme constitutional tribunal designed to elucidate great questions of law of such a kind as must inevitably arise in a **federation** for decision from time to time.

* Australian Farmers **Federation** president, Don Eckersley, also has warned his members may boycott the bank, and a resolution to the Cattlemen's Union convention this week recommends similar action.

* This switch to spending more on salaries and more on teachers has followed immense pressure on the New South Wales Government from the Teachers **Federation**.

* The New South Wales Government has preferred placating the Teachers **Federation** by acceding to its demands for more teachers and more pay, to providing a better balanced approach which would have been of far greater benefit to children in the State school system.

* The lack of discipline in and the militancy of the Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers **Federation** have caused tremendous disruption, brought about an unreliability in transport and increased costs which have had a crippling effect on every person in Tasmania.

* During the 1940s and the 1950s it was  Mr Chislett  of the United Graziers Association and  Mr Jilek  from the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** who shouldered the burden of giving advice on how high tariffs on their products were affecting the export industries.

* There is no easy solution to the problems of a **federation** and fund raising where there is the type of diversity which exists between the government regions or the political units.

* The Australian Soccer **Federation** hopes to have the world junior championships held in Australia in 1 98 1 .

* It was very gratifying to find that the Australian Olympic **Federation** has now been able to raise, dollar for dollar with the Commonwealth, $500,000 from private organisations.

* I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House wish the Olympic **Federation** well in the competition in Moscow next year.

* It is in these particular types of situations that small problems can develop into major disputes, often because those employers and managers, due to their own lack of knowledge and ability in industrial affairs, rely completely on the employers **federation** to arrange settlement of any of their troubles.

* The employers **federation**, from my knowledge of the way in which it acted during my time in union affairs, was a past master in the tactics of delay.

* On several occasions I have been involved in such situations where the union, having failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the employer, has served a log of claims which in turn has been passed on to the employers' **federation**, as the employers' representative, to handle.

* The **federation** would invariably wait until the very last day which the Act allowed before it would lodge its answers.

* When at long last a hearing date was arranged the **federation**, on some fixed or flimsy excuse, would seek a postponement.

* Then eventually when the hearing was fixed, when it was heard and when the decision was brought down the **federation** would try to delay speaking to the Minutes.

* This was the way in which the **federation** really justified its existence in the eyes of the employers.

* The employers and the employers **federation** are well aware of this.

* 1 have no doubt that the amendment to which I have just referred has been inserted on the demand of the employers **federation**.

* But this type of settlement does not suit the employers' **federation** which in earlier years was able to wave the big stick and practically demand of employers what they should do or should not do.

* The **Federation** over recent years has lost a lot of its influence with employers and is very concerned with the progress which unions are making.

* The **Federation** is most concerned that wage settlements which it would strongly oppose are being made outside industrial tribunals, and apparently the Government is equally concerned about that situation.

* He said: 

 Mr Polites, at that time anyway, was the main voice for the Employers **Federation**, an organisation whose views carry considerable weight with the Liberal-Country Party Government; an organisation whose members subscribe very largely to Liberal and Country Party funds; an organisation which over the years has done everything within its power to depress workers' wages and prevent improvement in conditions; an organisation which has acted as best it could to deny wage justice to workers in one industry, if such wage justice could perhaps flow on to workers in another industry.

* What  Mr Polites  was advocating was that if any wage justice exists in this country by way of some democratic system it should be replaced by a system of absolute dictatorship, a dictatorship controlled by a Liberal Government in collaboration with the Employers **Federation**, which could stop any further progress by unions towards obtaining a better deal for their members and, in turn, obtaining a fairer share of profits resulting from greater efforts of workers.

* It was obvious at that time that the Government had taken its instructions from the Employers **Federation**.

* Even if this was correct, and of course it is not, although we naturally respect their views, how much different would that be for the Liberal and Country Parties acting on the instructions of the Employers **Federation**?

* The second step taken by the Government to bring about the situation required by  Mr Polites  and his **Federation** is the Bill now being debated, a Bill containing amendments which, if allowed to he inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, will not, as the Treasurer suggested, give it any additional strength but will in fact weaken it very considerably in relation to the settlement of industrial disputes.

* If that is all the Minister wants to do, the Opposition would have some sympathy with him because it is recognised as a de facto situation and as a legal situation that long since the Waterside Workers' **Federation** has been given, with some minor exceptions, a monopoly of waterside worker labour.

* Whether it was originally intended that this barge operation should be able to work with Transport Workers Union labour as opposed to the equivalent of the North Australian Branch of the Waterside Workers **Federation** labour is perhaps immaterial, but the operation has been working in a certain way for 12 years.

* There has been tension between the Transport Workers Union and the North Australian Branch of the Waterside Workers **Federation** in the port of Darwin and it would be an unhappy circumstance if the Minister's amendment was to re-awake that tension and cause industrial difficulties of a kind that have been present in the past as a result of a demarcation dispute largely between 2 unions.

* He wishes to step in in a situation which is almost certain, because of Government legislative action, to lead to very considerable industrial dispute, not between labour and management but between the Transport Workers Union in the Northern Territory and the Waterside Workers **Federation** in the Northern Territory, as there has been a very substantial dispute in the past.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** of Australia did not want the abolition of the general industry levy which had applied prior to 1967.

* The **Federation** did not want the responsibility for the collection of the levy taken away from the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and placed in the hands of employers.

* One of the tragedies of government in Australia and indeed one of the tragedies besetting the Australian people is that the high hopes of the founding fathers of **Federation** have not yet been realised.

* It is not a bad idea and it is not a bad exercise for us in Australia in the 1970s to go back to the rhetoric of the constitutional debates - the **Federation** debates.

* It is not a bad idea for honourable members who have not been interested to attend to their duties to try to understand to re-read the speeches made not even at the turn of the century but before then, to find out what the high hopes of the founding fathers of our **Federation** were.

* But these are the first steps in the 1970s; 72 years after **Federation** we are trying to achieve some simple unity on professional qualifications.

* Yet, that offspring of the mother Parliament of the Australian Commonwealth can do things today nationally that we are unable to do after 72 years of so-called **Federation**.

* Is it intended to allocate a one time grant of $80,000 to the Royal Australian Nursing **Federation** Research and Education Trust to set up an initial sinking fund, and to enable an interdisciplinary group, including nurses and other professionals in the health care field, to plan and recommend funding from the Trust for research and educational programs.

* The industry in Tasmania, represented by the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation**, has presented a very good case to the Minister for Primary Industry,  Senator Wriedt.

* In the case it has presented to the Minister the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** stated: 
In presenting its case the **Federation** also mentioned the possibility of the Federal Government providing funds for promotion and sales of fresh apple juice and products containing a high percentage of apple juice on the local market.

* Our Rural Committee would agree entirely with the submission from the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation**.

* Another suggestion made by the **Federation** is that the Federal Government provide funds for promotion and sales of apple juice on overseas markets.

* The **Federation** says that it is believed that export potential exists but that the necessity for very rapid expansion of this market would require substantial expenditure over a short period; it is not realistic to expect individual processors to risk such large sums of money.

* Another suggestion put by  Mr R.  E. Wolf, acting secretary of the Apple and Pear Growers **Federation** of Tasmania, is that the Federal Government should provide funds for research into alternative apple products from apples which formerly were used for juice.

* He chanced upon the marvellous idea that he would ask one of the most dangerous communists this country has ever seen, Ted Roach, none other, who was then the Assistant Secretary of the Waterside Workers **Federation**, to confer with him in secret.

* We could not understand why it was that the communist controlled Waterside Workers **Federation** had won the march.

* But by some foul little plot these evil communist people belonging to the Waterside Workers **Federation** had the cup.

* This Act was the result of discussions during the years immediately after **federation** when At was sought to adapt existing British legislation to Australian conditions.

* In the period since 1912 numerous considerations have been given to updating the Navigation Act to bring it more in line with the needs of a young and growing maritime **federation**.

* However, it is a poor reflection on our Constitution and our progress as a **Federation** that, 76 years after attaining nationhood, our shipping industry is regulated in the main by British legislation drawn up to meet the needs of a 19th century colonial empire.

* The years since **Federation** have seen a number of great changes in the Australian shipping scene.

* Teachers **Federation** and others and I indicated to them that if there was a request that locked off the New South Wales problem as one special to New South Wales I could undertake to ask the Prime Minister to consider it sympathetically.

* It is the day before the day on which we celebrate **Federation** - Australia Day.

* The **Federation** has read newspaper reports of statements alleged to have been made by you in the House of Representatives re 'the indemnity payments admitted to have been made to the Waterside Workers' **Federation**'.

* I am at this point of time attempting to obtain copies of the exact statement made by yourself in the House of Representatives but in the meantime in order to ensure that no incorrect impression exists in your mind or is allowed to continue without challenge by this Union, I wish to unequivocally advise that no indemnity payment of any character has been sought by the Waterside Workers' **Federation** of Australia in respect of its operations.

* Mr C. H. Fitzgibbon, General Secretary, Waterside Workers' **Federation**, P.O.

* 1 October 1974 
Each FOC vessel enters into an industrial agreement with the ITF (with the **Federation** acting as the ITF agent, at the request of the latter) which- 
I would also like to say that one part of a Press report which had been quoted also misrepresented, and I picked up this misrepresentation, the Minister for Transport himself because the Press report, and consequently myself in the Parliament, gave the impression that the Minister for Transport had given some immunity to the Waterside Workers **Federation** over an indemnity payments issue.

* So I believe that the issues are separate and separable and that on all the evidence available to me the Waterside Workers **Federation** position is quite different and separate from the involvement of the Seamen's Union in the Royal Commission which is presently sitting.

* The Prime Minister recognised the valuable contributions made by organisations such as the Australian Wool and Meat Producers **Federation**, the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Australian Wool Growers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Farmers' **Federation**, in responding to a question asked in the Parliament this week.

* Never before in the history of **Federation** has a government provided this sort of help pending a detailed report into a company's operations.

* But I think it is important that we recognise that out of this assessment of the 2 prime groupings of the community, the Treasurer and those who frame the economic policy of this Government are pursuing a course which is directly contributing to inflation; a course which very much relates to the matter now a subject of debate in this chamber - the imposition by the Government of the highest and most onerous interest rates since **federation**.

* Some responsible officials and members of the **Federation** - 
That is the Waterside Workers **Federation**- have expressed concern at the failure of employers to exercise appropriate and consistent control in relation to undisciplined behaviour by a minority of waterside workers.

* We know that under the conference agreement which we hoped would bear fruit, people can be declared to be redundant by the Authority only upon a request from either the Waterside Workers **Federation** or the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour.

* I know that the Minister knows this, because of the necessity or the desire of the ship owners to get a quick turn around of their ships the ship owners always agree to what the Waterside Workers **Federation** puts up.

* The Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour is always under a compulsion to make a sweetheart agreement with the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* So we have the continual pressure of the Waterside Workers **Federation** leaning on the shipowners through the AEWL, causing a continual increase in costs which, as the honourable member for Corangamite spelt out so clearly earlier, is imposing a dreadful burden not only on the exporter but also on the community as a whole because the costs of imports and exports are increased by these sweetheart agreements.

* The Waterside Workers **Federation** can move in on a ship and take particular action and the shipowner will always give in because he is at the mercy of the **Federation**.

* The tragedy of Australia's situation is that it is operated for the convenience of the shipowners and the Waterside Workers **Federation**.

* The fundamental problem that we face is that the shipowners and the Waterside Workers **Federation** are getting their way.

* Mr Foster  no doubt knows that it is operated for the convenience of the Waterside Workers **Federation** and the shipowners.

* Perhaps-  Mr Foster  referred to this- there should be a wider union than the Waterside Workers **Federation** covering the employment on the waterfront.

* Uniform taxation was introduced in this country because we recognised, as a nation, that the States were so disparate and diverse, so unequal in their populations and their tax resources, that without a coordinating and overriding Federal responsibility for growth, welfare and development, the very ideal of **federation** would be at risk; pressures and disparaties among the States would produce a grossly unequal and therefore divided nation.

* I understand that this was in accordance with the representations made to the Eggleston Committee by both the **Federation** of Australian University Staff Associations and the ViceChancellors' Committee.

* It must be remembered that 3 weeks annual leave was established as standard for Commonwealth public servants at the time of **federation** nearly 70 years ago.

* Let me just draw his attent on to the fact that while this body of workers had 3 weeks' annual leave at the commencement of **federation** nearly 70 years ago.

* The Commonwealth public servants, of course, received the equivalent increase in the margins but their standard of annual leave remained at 3 weeks, which has been the standard since **federation**.

* I am sure that the honourable member for Corio would have been sent a copy of it anyway, seeing that it was circulated by the **Federation** of Polish Organisations of Victoria- and Corio, I believe, is still in Victoria.

* If local government wants to have a greater say in the development of our federal system, as I believe it does, this Council, structured as it is by this Bill, will give it an adequate opportunity to develop its place in the **Federation**.

* This Council, comprised as it will be of local government representatives, will give to local government a significant place in the **Federation**.

* Anybody who has studied the Commonwealth since **Federation** will realise the importance of the part that the States have to play.

* We on this side of the House are well aware that in its short term of office, this Government has been eroding the benefits and standards of rural life and industry so carefully guarded by the Australian Country Party and past governments since **Federation**.

* )(b) of the Electoral Act that the Minister looks to obtain justification to introduce his electoral gerrymander and it is by a reduction of the 20 per cent differential that has applied since **Federation** to 10 per cent in the number of electors in each seat above or below the quota of each State that the Minister looks for the right to implement his gerrymander.

* Under the Act that has been with us since **Federation** and as proposed by our founding fathers, only 3 seats out of 45 in New South Wales have more than a 20 per cent variation from the quota.

* whenever in one-fourth of the Divisions of the Stale the number of the electors differs from a quota ascertained in the manner provided in this Part to a greater extent than one-fifth more or onefifth less; 
1 ) What is the average term of office of (a) Members and ( b) Senators since (i) **federation**, (ii) 1 930 and (iii) 1 950.

* What proportion of (a) Members and (b) Senators attained at least 20 years service (including broken periods of service since (i) **federation**, (ii) 1 930 and (iii) 1 950.

* In Canada by virtue of a special legislative provision, the question was referred to the Supreme Court, at the instance of the **Federation** itself in relation to the Province of British Columbia.

* Sovereign control over the mineral resources of both the territorial sea and the continental shelf was held to be vested in the **Federation** alone, to the exclusion of the component States or Provinces.

* The figure of 1,000 was first suggested to the IAC by the Printing and Allied Trades Employers **Federation** of Australia, a body which frankly represents the larger printing organisations, not the smaller ones.

* I also remind him that the decision was taken by the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** in Perth on 11th, 12th and 13th March 1969, which is hardly the middle of the season.

* The resolutions are: 
'That this **Federation** accepts the principle that wheat production control is necessary.'

* 'That this **Federation** formulate a plan for wheat production control to be recommended to the State affiliates for implementation as soon as practicable."

* Ft is the unanimous desire of affiliated members of the **Federation** that the quota proposals be introduced for the coming harvest 1969-70.

* I want to, just briefly, quote again from a statement by a  Mr Price  who was senior vice-president of the Australian Wheatgrowers' **Federation** at the time.

* He is now the  president  of the **Federation**.

* He said: 
I would strongly refute that there has been any political pressure exerted on the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation**, either before the implementation of quotas or since their introduction.

* My organisation accepts full responsibility in originally assessing the need for wheat quotas; 
Meaning the **Federation**'s request - that the Federal and State governments recognised the correctness of our attitude in endeavouring to come to grips with the current situation involving a surplus to sales potential of at least 250 million bushels of wheat.

* That was said by the senior vice-president of the Australian Wheatgrowers **Federation** and the  President  at that time, who happened to be  Mr McDougall,  said in the Financial Review' on 6th May 1969: 
On 13th March, the Australian Wheat Growers **Federation** decided to restrict the production of wheat in Australia.
