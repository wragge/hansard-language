## Contexts in which the word "federation" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* The fact that an ordinance of this kind has to be debated in this Parliament after some 72 years of **federation** and after the Australian Capital Territory has been in existence for well over 40 years is the strongest condemnation of this Government's inertia and complete failure to provide a proper and alternative system of making, laws for the ACT.

* Its representatives in the original Labor **federation** were elected to observe these principles and abide by them.

* It is the worst example of sectional discrimination ever visited on any single industry by any Treasurer as far as I can tell in the history of the **federation** of the Australian States.

* In the commercial field, for example, it is worth taking account of the famous Keidanren which is a **federation** of economic organisations.

* Not only must it be between governments in a **federation**, the three spheres of government- Commonwealth, State and local- but also there must be greater cooperation between the vertically organised functional departments within a government.

* We adopt that stance because we recognise that Australia is a **federation**.

* I know full well that the honourable member for Newcastle and other members of the Opposition, were they in Government, would never tolerate a select committee of the House of Representatives being responsible for what will be one of the most complicated policy decisions facing all of the governments functioning within this **federation** today.

* If the United Kingdom goes into the Common Market then the political identity of that country in the years to come will succumb and be lost within the framework of a European **federation**.

* It was an employer which, as far back as the beginning of **federation** in 1901  -  nearly 70 years ago - introduced the principle of 3 week's annual leave.

* Notwithstanding that promise this Government has forced up the interest rate structure to the highest level since **federation**.

* I do not know whether the State of Victoria wants to run the whole **federation** and to say that it is speaking on behalf of all the States.

* The inability of the West Pakistan authorities to assist and the indifference of the outside world undoubtedly played a part in East Pakistan's dissatisfaction with remaining in the Pakistan **federation**.

* This is the first time since **federation** that such an indepth detailed examination has been made by the Army of its own organisation.

* I never heard anybody, even on the other side of the House, suggest that the United States of America ought to change its name or suggest that in some way it was not a country which was made up of a number of States that had brought themselves together into a form of **federation**.

* In a little under two years this Government has done more in terms of special policies for Tasmania than, I think, any other government has done since the **federation** of Australia.

* It is just 200 years since Captain Cook discovered Australia, 182 years since Captain Phillip came with the First Fleet, 69 years since **federation**, and 25 years since the late Ben Chifley became Prime Minister of Australia.

* The Australian Senate was set up for the sole purpose of enabling a **federation** of the States to take place.

* Section 62a of the Audit Act has existed since **federation**.

* What is also perfectly true is that they have to be the highest in absolute money terms because since **federation** this country has never seen a rate of inflation equal to that which we see at present because of the maladministration of this Government.

* It may have been that back benchers were influential at some stage in the history of **federation**, but I doubt it.

* I imagine that any sort of development of an open university with a reinforcement of external studies with all sorts of modern techniques and a **federation** of universities to do this sort of work- I do not want to anticipate the report but that is a possibility- obviously would be a method of encouraging this sort of student.

* I am informed that this is a practice which has gone on almost since **federation** on the eve of a Budget.

* I think that they should face up to the fact that they will have to compete more and that they will have to do their bit and go along with the proposals of the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Wheatgrowers **federation** and the Government.

* I refer particularly to the electorate of Swan because without the agreement on the then trans-line it is doubtful that Western Australia would have joined the **federation**.

* How galling it must be to lead a party that has been in Opposition for 22 years; how humiliating to lead a party that in  70  years of **federation** has been out of office for over  50  years.

* Never before in the whole history of **federation** has there been put through this House with such indelicate haste a measure of this nature.

* I should like to recapitulate in very short terms the concern expressed to me by the States and by the road **federation** bodies throughout Australiathat is, the transport operators- that the Bill gives the Commonwealth Railways, or the Australian National Railways Commission as we perhaps now should call it, power much wider than that required for the purposes which the Bill is said to enact.

* Within the limits of this speech, the foregoing is an over simplified exposition naturally, but it is at the practical root, I believe, of the Government's disinclination to impose target dates, and that accounts for its policy - which is correct, in my view, on both philosophical and pragmatic grounds - to expedite development throughout the Territory so that, when the people determine for home rule, there will be, first, some prospect of a national outlook; secondly, some prospect for cohesion against secession movements - there are at least 4 active in Bougainville, the Gazelle, the Highlands and Papua - and personal ambitions for leadership, but perhaps they can form together a **federation**; and, thirdly, some prospects of government under a democratic system rather than relapse into army or political dictatorship under some strong man, a few of whom can be seen today striving mightily with the cry.

* We had been a **federation** then for 67 years.

* After 72 years of **federation** $ 10,000m was required to fund the national expenditure.

* The Minister for Finance  (Mr Eric Robinson)  will appreciate that the State College of Victoria is, in a sense, a **federation** of teachers' colleges in Australia with the status of colleges of advanced education.

* As the honourable gentleman would know, there are many items in the tariff schedule which have been there perhaps since **federation**.

* I draw to the attention of honourable members that Tasmania, with about 3 per cent of Australia's population, has within a few decimal points or so maintained fairly constantly 3 per cent of the Australian industrial population since the beginning of industrialisation in Australia, certainly since **federation**.

* We are a much less effective **federation** than, say, Canada or even, I think, the United States of America because great areas of conflict have developed between ourselves and the so-called sovereign States.

* In the history of our **federation**, there has never been the sort of investigation that I suggest.

* The proposal for an art gallery for Canberra is almost as old as **federation**.

* The amendment moved by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  is as follows: 
Setting aside the constitutional difficulties which exist in our **federation** where States rightly claim areas of authority - though we all know that the Labor Party does not want the States to have any authority - one finds in these economic arguments a great tendency to brush aside constitutional problems, even by Labor Queen's Counsel.

* The court house was acquired from the State of Victoria in 1870 and the post office was transferred to the Commonwealth at the time of **federation**.

* Australia is a **federation** and many of the powers concerning energy rest with the States.

* I think that is unfortunate because one of the things that ought to happen in a **federation** in which there is more than one level of government is the establishment of systems and laws which require consultation, require negotiation and prevent the kind of self-willed decision making which this Government has become typical for and noted for in a number of fields.

* Unfortunately, because of the expressed rights of the colonies at the time and because they felt there was a need to have a States House, which after **federation** rapidly became a Party House, the situation developed- and it exists at the present time- where the Senate in certain circumstances could refuse Supply and thus force the House of Representatives to an election without having to go to an election itself.

* Retail prices have been rising at an average rate of 2.8 per cent a year since **federation**.

* In future the Whitlam Labor Government will be marked as the most realistic and progressive that this nation has had since **federation** because it has faced up to the realities of the times and has given overall benefits to the Australian people today and for generations to come.

* I should think that the last two years have been the most sterile for a Commonwealth government in the history of Australian **federation**.

* The area between the 200 metre mark and the end of what is called compendiously the continental margin is to be handed over to a trusteeship arrangement operated by the United Nations and the coastal state - 'state' is used in that context in international law, not as a component of **federation** - for the purposes of international law.

* In a **federation** such as ours, which is designed to express the unity of the Australian people it is vital that we have a court system for the enforcement of State and Federal laws which is as unified as circumstances permit and not one that is divisive.

* In a **federation** a judicial system can be a cohesive force.

* Indeed, the practice of this Parliament since **federation** has been consistently to appoint men to such an office.

* Buka and Bougainville are being pushed towards complete secession -which is what they would probably vote for, union of the British Solomons which might be an intelligent settlement, or **federation**.

* We have the table on which Queen Victoria signed the proclamation for our Constitution, and that set up this Parliament as the **federation** of the Australian colonies.

* The Bill provides, 1 think clearly enough for anyone who reads it carefully to understand, that it will have no application to internal waters as they existed at **federation**.

* The Leader of the House is the only Minister since **federation** to have faced 2 motions of censure on his personal conduct.

* Can the Postmaster-General state how the amount of funds provided to the Postmaster-General's Department by the Treasury since **federation**, namely $2,484,331,130 was arrived at?

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal water's as they existed at **federation**, the States have no such rights.

* It makes the same provision in respect of the internal waters of Australia, except as they existed at **federation**.

* In the case of a federal state, where for domestic purposes supreme legislative and executive power is divided between the **federation** and its component states or provinces, the question frequently arises whether the control of off-shore resources is exercisable, as a matter of internal constitutional law, by the **federation** itself, or by its component states or provinces, or is shared between both.

* the Queen's assertion of sovereignty in the territorial sea, recognised by international law, was not delegated to or conferred on the Australian colonies before **federation**.

* Firstly, in the formula customarily used where an Act is regarded as stating the law as it already exists, as well as possibly making new law, the Bill declares and enacts that the sovereignty in the territorial sea is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 5; similarly that the sovereign rights of Australia for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 10; and that sovereignty in the internal waters of Australia, with the important exception of waters that were internal waters of the States at the time of **federation**, and still remain such, is likewise vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clauses 9 and 11, which must be read together.

* This latter clause makes clear that the Act will not apply to waters that at **federation** were within the limits of a State and still remain within the limits of the State.

* These bays and harbours were within the limits of a State at **federation**, and remain so.

* Here, any interna] waters were within the limits of South Australia at the time of **federation** but passed to the Commonwealth when the Northern Territory was surrendered.

* But there are also off-shore waters which have become or may become internal waters of Australia by virtue of changes in international law since **federation**.

* At the time of **federation**, the general law was that the baseline of the territorial sea followed around the coast except where it encountered a bay whose width at the entrance was not more than 6 miles, that is, twice the then generally accepted breadth of the territorial sea.

* But I should note that any bays or waters declared in pursuance of clause 7 to be historic, as contrasted with bays that were already historic before **federation**, would come into the category of post-**federation** internal waters, to which clause 9 would apply.

* Whether that homeland is a separate entity, part of Jordan or joined in a **federation** with Jordan, is yet to be determined.

* Having in mind the considerations which constrained the States, particularly the less populated States, to demand as the price of **federation** an Upper House with powers to exercise independent judgment in order to protect the interests of the States, it is inconceivable that those same States would agree to weaken the Senate by destroying its independence.

* This Bill really represents the latest attempt by the Government to destroy the just and fair principles on which electoral distributions have been conducted since **federation**.

* The Leader of the Opposition talked about the 3 elections that had been held since the Vietnam war commenced, but he did not make the point that one of those 3 elections in which the Vietnamese policy was the vital issue, the 1966 election, saw this Government returned with the greatest strength that any Government has had during the 70 years history of **federation** in this country.

* It was because of consistent policies that were implemented by successive Liberal-Country Party governments for 23 years; that has put the Northern Territory into a position where, in the not too distant future, it will be able to take its place in the **federation** of Australia.

* The fact is that this Parliament is still working under much the same procedures in 1971 as it worked under in 1901, the time of **federation**.

* The Labor Party then nominated  Mr George 
This Bill really represents the latest attempt by the Government to destroy the just and fair principles on which electoral distributions have been conducted since **federation**.

* Australia would be the only nation in the world to go to that conference with the units of its **federation** dithering on the point as to whether the States or the Commonwealth had sovereignty over these areas.

* But although all adult males were entitled to the vote in all States by 1900, female suffrage was accorded in only 2 States at the time of **federation**.

* Two other States, probably indicating their reactionary and conservative culture, did not introduce female suffrage until after **federation**.

* I believe that that represents the largest number lodged for presentation at any one time since **federation**.

* The first question is: Why is it that the Labor Party has occupied the treasury bench for less than 17 years in the 72 years since **federation**?

* I was interested to read in today's  Australian Financial Review  the comments of the  President  of the Waterside Workers Federation,  Mr C.  H. Fitzgibbon, which were reported as follows: 
While the **federation** would hope that common sense and justice would prevail, we must prepare organisationally for the possibility that that will not be the position.

* It is a **federation**.

* He wants to restore the value of repatriation benefits despite the fact that this Budget provides the greatest repatriation benefits ever in the history of **federation** But what does the vague collection of the words 'restore repatriation benefits' mean?

* The Tariff Board was established in 1921 and it has been an important and respected source of advice to 21 of the 28 Parliaments which have been elected since **federation**.

* would be consistent with Australian Government policy since **federation** that the National Capital be developed on land acquired by the Australian Government.

* No Prime Minister in the history of **federation** has had this experience.

* There we have the 2 most populous States in our **federation** and the most isolated State in our **federation**, which have a major responsibility for roads and a major need for road maintenance and construction, all echoing the comments of each other.

* Of course they do not, for the simple reason that our constitutional fathers made lt practically impossible to change the system that they established and they could never have achieved **federation** unless that system came about.

* With the deferment of Supply by the conservative senators late last year we saw the destruction of the system that had developed in the first three-quarters of a century of our development as a **federation**.

* Since **federation**, since we became a Commonwealth, we have had only 8 redistributions in 76 years.

* Of course, he probably achieved more in real terms for the trade union movement in Australia during his occupancy of that most important portfolio than any previous Minister had achieved in the history of Australia since **federation**.

* The consolidation of the three states under the wing of Vietnam looks like the fulfilment of Ho Chi Minh 's dream of a communist Indo-China **federation**, especially in view of the American withdrawal.

* Therefore may I suggest that for the sake of good relations within the **federation** and for ease of administration Part III be limited to the Northern Territory.

* The Treasurer rose in this place on Tuesday night to tell the world he was introducing antiinflationary measures  by  bringing down the most severe impost in postal and telegraph charges that this country has seen since **federation**.

* It is most significant to look at what has happened since **federation**.

* Section 87 provided that the customs and excise duties, which were virtually the only taxes available in the early days of **federation** would be distributed on the basis that three-quarters of this amount would go to the States and the remaining one-quarter would go to the Commonwealth.

* To provide support (chiefly through clerical assistance) to encourage the formation of an Australian **federation** of consumer organisations; 
The Victorian Employers Federation yesterday called for a public inquiry into the operation of the Australian Telecommunications Commission.

* I mean since **federation** - 
The message from the Senate on the Bills which appropriate the moneys for the ordinary annual services of government is a direct challenge by the Senate to the authority of the House of Representatives.

* In other federations where this same question of the authority of the central government or the provincial or State governments over off-shore areas has been an issue, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act has been held up as a hallmark of cooperation within a **federation** instead of a persistent confrontation between the 2 forms of government, which can lead only to divisiveness, a slackening of exploration and outrage by the provincial or State governments at the attempted takeover by the central government particularly because of the financial ramifications of such a takeover.

* That litigation is still going on in those 2 great federations, whereas in Australia some six or seven years ago we found a solution to that confrontation between governments in the one **federation**.

* We may well find ourselves in the Pacific still arguing the merits of the Constitution when the whole world has changed or when Great Britain itself has probably entered a **federation** of Europe and is part and parcel of a federal system with a complete new concept.

* The changed circumstances of the House since **federation** have made a reduction in tha quorum necessary and reasonable.

* This is the greatest threat to democracy since the foundation of this **federation**.

* It is true that in the first half century of **federation** governments always included such Ministers.

* I believe in the **federation**.

* My fear is that Australia is heading for the day when it has, in effect, a unitary government operating within a warped and inappropriate- or no longer appropriate- framework of a **federation**.

* What I doubt is the wisdom of developing a situation in which a **federation** is controlled by its national government where that control is through the purse strings.

* After 71 years of **federation** and millions of words in support of decentralisation, Australia now is the most urbanised country on earth.

* I think that by the exercise of force the Government has reached the point where the best thing it can hope for in the future is a **federation**, with local government or provincial government in some of these areas exercising power over land as a means of defending the areas against Port Moresby.

* The Labor Party will win this election because of the known qualities of its team and its policies, because it has men better prepared for office than any who have sought to gain office at any election since **federation**, and because our policies are the best prepared and most thoroughly scrutinised ever presented by any party at any election since **federation**.

* The nation was the same size at the time of **federation** in 1901, and it has not changed materially since then.

* Members of the Liberal and National Country Parties ought to remember their boast that they have controlled government in this chamber for two-thirds of the time since **federation**.

* We now reach a situation in 1976, after a Liberal-Country Party Administration for two-thirds of the time since **federation**, in which a major industry, one of national importance, is to close.

* We pointed out earlier in this debate that the disparity between the various States in representation in the Senate in accordance with the number of people in the States, all States having equal numbers of senators although they have great differences in population, arose from a federal compact and we paid this price as the price of **federation**, lt is not something which we should otherwise willingly have paid but the compact has been made.

* I suppose this is the only way in which our **federation** will advance.

* I believe that that is the correct course to take in a **federation**.

* Indeed in 1896 the British Government in an order in council adopted a new line but it was not put into legislative form because **federation** took place here.

* Apart from the obvious need for the Australian States to establish a Federal government responsible for defence, external affairs, immigration and other matters, in which Commonwealth influence is becoming progressively greater, I believe that few problems could have influenced the founders of **federation** more than the hotchpotch of railway systems of that time, with various gauges in various States.

* But I am not prepared to participate in any way in a method which emphasises the dependence of Australia instead of its independence and creates a precedent for further request and consent legislation which can seriously imperil the constitutional status of the 6 constituent members of our **federation**.

* The 1918 Australian Labor Party conference abolished its platform for effective **federation** and adopted the following platform: 
The Bill is indeed consistent with our federalism policy, the most significant component of which is Stage 1 of the tax sharing formula, whereby an increase of 2 1 per cent on last year's allocation has been made in this Budget.

* I turn from that to the recent move by the State Premiers to go to London but I observe in passing that to compare the Australian federal system in this context with the American federal system is to misunderstand completely the 2 separate systems of **federation**.

* If prospective travel agents are to be registered by government and to be approved by their **federation**, 2 bodies will be looking at them to see whether they are the right type of person.

* Following on the expansion of the Australian Grants Commission, which involved the recognition of 74 regional groupings of councils in Australia and the recognition of these groupings by the Minister, we have seen the most exciting development in local government since **federation**.

* The West Indies Federation came apart and instead of staying as a **federation** we now have Trinidad, Tobago and Guiana and various other places.

* The central African **federation** fell apart; it fell apart amicably.

* The task that they are about in dismembering our **federation** can have one result only, that is, serious and irretrievable damage to our constitutional system and to our nation.

* So blatant were these attempts to influence the Commission that the  President  stated: 
Australia is a **federation** and the states have the responsibility for most of the activities which are closest to the lives of people - Education, Health, Housing, Conservation and a wide range of others.

* The bottom could drop out of the minerals market at any time, but the primary industries built this country and they maintain it In the 24 years that I have been in this Parliament I have defended primary industries and advocated the best possible deal for them more than has any man since **federation**.

* Fifty years ago the Americans realised what was necessary to deal with the securities market in a **federation** of States.

* Once we forgot that we are a **federation** we will forget our responsibilities as members in this House and as members of the Australian community.

* If we do not make the **federation** work soon in a real sense the whole of this country's fabric will be undermined.

* That is not the choice at all; the choice in Australia is whether the **federation** survives as a **federation** on the one hand or, on the other, whether we have a series of nation states.

* With the dynamism and drive of our new federalism policy, with the States being given the opportunity to do things as they should have been permitted to do them under a federal system for 75 years- they are getting their first chance in the 76th year of our **federation**- I believe that we will be able to give the housing policy of this country a tremendous drive.

* But with respect, I say that is not a mis-statement because in a **federation**, the problems of house owners in New South Wales may be totally different from those of house owners in South Australia.

* I think the Committee will agree with me, upon due deliberation, that that principle upon which, generally speaking, retrospective laws are not favoured simply does not apply in a case involving people who for years, indeed ever since **federation**, have ordered their affairs on the assumption that the laws made by the State Parliaments, unless specifically directed - which they never were - to Commonwealth places, had a general application in those places; so it could not be said that people committing activities of a criminal nature were undertaking those activities in the belief that they would be exempt from criminal law in relation to those activities.

* Although under the Australian Constitution the financial responsibility for local govern ment is purely a matter for the States - when **federation** took place this was one aspect of government which was allocated to the various States - I nevertheless feel that the Federal Government has a financial interest in local government and should make the muscle available for it to carry out the works which I have enumerated.

* I am fearful of the infringements to the civil rights, liberties and freedoms of the Australian people that have been upheld since **federation**.

* At the time of **federation**, as my learned friend from Moreton  (Mr Killen)  has said, there were various ways of determining where, in the case of a bay, one drew the base line.

* What is actually happening in the Commonwealth sphere, in relation to decentralisation after 70 years of **federation**?

* Who would shoot a Tasmanian to keep Tasmania in the **federation**?

* The honourable member would shoot them to keep them in the **federation**; the Treasurer would probably say he would pay them to go.

* Within the framework of their own concepts of **federation**, the present problem is irreconcilable.

* the Queen's assertion of sovereignty in the territorial sea, recognised by international law, was not delegated to or conferred on the Australian colonies before **federation**.

* Where SAA standards have been set - 
I remember a few years ago reading some of the old debates on social services going as far back as the early stages of **federation**.

* The Interim Commission was also asked to examine general issues pertinent to consumer protection, to encourage the formation of a **federation** of consumer organisations, to investigate consumer education, to arrange liaison between Federal and State consumer officials and, most importantly, to make recommendations about a permanent body that should ultimately take its place.

* The Summers report highlighted the need for modernisation of existing legislation and one can appreciate how that is absolutely vital when one considers that after almost 80 years as a **federation** our shipping industry has been regulated largely by British legislation drawn up for the purpose of a nineteenth century colonial empire.

* As the Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  remarked when he spoke earlier in this debate, that speech was an extraordinary departure from the proprieties and conventions which have controlled the content of second reading speeches since this Parliament was formed at **federation**.

* The purpose of honourable gentlemen opposite is to divert attention from the fact that the Australian electoral system, which is embodied at present in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and which has remained substantially unchanged since **federation**, produces one of the most electorally just systems in the world.

* But I would invite the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that all of the components in the Australian **federation**, all of the States, remain legally tied to the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the Statute of Westminster.

* The United Kingdom created colonies which were transformed to States when the **federation** was established.

* in 1901 - that was at **federation** - Australia's population stood at 3.75 million.

* He, like his colleagues on the Opposition side of the chamber, believes in a confederation, not a **federation**.

* There is nothing even like the compact clause in the United States Constitution which enables agreements between State governments in that **federation** to be given formal, legal supportlimited as this provision may be.

* Aside from this, for 75 years we have operated in an essentially  ad hoc  fashion in attempting to create orderly arrangements between the governments of the **federation**.

* We have 4 tory governments in this so-called **federation** which choose to continue to compound the situation by their hotchpotch of interstate corporate affairs commissions.

* I believe that one of the gravest mistakes that has ever been made by any government since **federation** was that men were conscripted to be sent overesas in an undeclared war.

* I believe that some people in Western Australia would be prepared to seize all power and even secede, no matter how illegal such action would be, from the **federation** to establish a totalitarian system of some son without giving 
The Australian Federation of Consumer Organizations.

* We will again give the people the opportunity to face up to their constitutional responsibilities rather than do what governments and people of this country in fact have done since **federation**, that is, to rely upon the High Court for any meaningful constitutional change by way of High Court interpretation rather than changing the Constitution by way of referendum.

* The States have had power to control prices since **federation**.

* How many people realise that in 72 years of Australian **federation** the Budget reached $ 10,000m but in the next  2Vi  years it went to $22,000m.

* Mining and processing give us very much opportunity nationally and, in particular, give an opportunity to the 2 less populous but larger States of the **federation**, Queensland and Western Australia.

* It was the most expensive afternoon tea we have had in the history of **federation**.

* The point about the 1 day sitting is that we had the most expensive afternoon tea in the history of **federation** while the people who hoped to get something from the Meals on Wheels legislation received nothing.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except In respect of internal waters as they existed at **federation**, the States have no such rights.

* Mr Wran  knows that our policy has appeal because people see in it a genuine attempt to end the wrangling that has gone on over the years between the Commonwealth and the States, a genuine attempt to give financial reality to the Australian **federation**.

* In the 73 years since **federation**, Federal courts have been established to deal only with matters of bankruptcy and industrial law.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal waters as they existed at **federation**, the States have no such rights.

* Great problems in respect of health are brought about by the system of **federation** under which we live.

* I agree with **federation** and 1 support it.

* It is history now that he pulled the political plug on the worst government since **federation**.

* But more importantly, the question is being asked in many places: Can they survive as independent small nations or should they consider some form of loose **federation**?

* My own view is that the ideal solution for the governmental structure of these islands of the South Pacific would be some form of loose **federation**.

* I would hope that this **federation** could include Papua and New Guinea, for it is not possible to think about the political viability of the islands in the South Pacific without considering the future of Papua and New Guinea.

* A **federation** rather than a unified state should be our aim.

* The first **federation** in the West Indies was imposed by the British Government when it handed over control.

* The strains were too great and the **federation** broke up.

* This was the first time that a pension increase had been back-dated since **federation**.

* The payments of various descriptions which have been made to the States have continued since the beginning of **federation**.

* If we want to preserve the **federation** in something like its present form, we should at least spell out why we want to do that.

* When dealing, in effect, with the referral provisions - they are apposite to the matter before the House - this is what  Sir John  Cockburn said shortly after **federation**: 
We stand by, year after year, while vast amounts of taxpayers money are wasted on sterile disputes concerning the extent of Commonwealth and State powers while the taxpayers of the Commonwealth have to listen to Australian and State governments passing the buck back and forth.

* It may be reviewed either as a loose confederation of quasi-independent States or as a national **federation**.

* It must in my opinion serve the purposes of an Australian **federation** of States and not preserve a confederation.

* I find that the shocking decision of the Gorton Government not to allow the Snowy Mountains Authority to carry out any construction works in Australia, not even in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory, is a decision which must rank as one of the worst political decisions ever made by any Federal Government since **federation**.

* However, that just indicates that at that stage some of the States and very many people in Australia did have reservations about whether we should join together in a **federation** of the various colonies.

* He had been in this and in the Victorian Parliament, as the Prime Minister stated, for 43 years - more than half the life of our **federation**.

* Interstate inequalities of fiscal capacity are not a transitory characteristic of the Australian **federation**.

* Since the introduction of uniform income tax all successive federal governments, Liberal or Labor, have seen fit to continue it as being the best way to manage the financial affairs of our nation- as a **federation**- as one Australia, as one country, not as 6 colonies each going its own way.

* What is of paramount importance is thai if Australia is to continue to develop as a **federation**, with the best interests of the whole nation as the objective, there has to be a uniform taxation collected by the Australian Government.

* The Opposition seeks to divide, dismantle and disintegrate our system of government, to undermine and destroy our **federation**, our nation.

* I only hope that the spirit with which the honourable member for Wannon endows the State education systems and the other bodies, with the idea of using **federation** as a co-operative undertaking, is the case.

* If we are going to consider **federation** as a co-operative undertaking, the time has come for a good deal of the politics to be taken out and a lot more of the principles injected into relationships between this Government and several of the Australian mainland State governments.

* Over the same 23 years of Liberal rule the debts of local government - I remind the House that it is local government of all the levels of government in our **federation** which is required to finance virtually all its capital works from borrowed money - increased no less than 10i times.

* I have always thought that the purpose of a **federation** is to form a nation.

* It has been talked about by nearly every government since **federation** but it has never been enacted.

* Before **federation** the 6 Australian colonies shared one thing in common.

* This has been one of the great expedients in Australia common to no other country where a **federation** has come into being and federal jurisdiction has been conferred on the components of the **federation**.

* Since shortly after **federation** Australia has had a system of conciliation and arbitration which was designed to settle, by peaceful means, industrial disputes between employers and unions- a system which has provided many advantages for employers, unions and the community.

* He misses the point that it is at the request of the Australian Teachers Federation and the teachers themselves that appeals from determinations of the Public Service Board under our proposals or from determinations made by the Commission without the Public Service Board's approval under the Opposition's proposals may be made to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration 
The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota Tor a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a **federation**, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* With the coming of **federation**, in 1904 a Commonwealth Act was brought into effect.

* that exists throughout the **federation** .

* Our parliamentary institutions are still geared to the atmosphere of the early years of **federation**.

* I am ashamed to admit in the presence of so many distinguished visitors in the gallery that the Australian **federation** still lags some way behind the mother of parliaments.

* If they do reject the Budget they think they will make history not only in the Australian **federation** but in the Englishspeaking world, in parliamentary systems throughout the world.

* I make one last point: Conditions in the Australian States differ less than they do in any other **federation**.

* It is obvious from work done by Professor Williams in Chicago that the levels of standards as between the poorest and richest Australian States differ less than they do in any other large **federation** in the world.

* The instrument for the destruction of the power of the House of Commons- the power over the purse- is the very instrument, the Constitution compromise, by which the disparate States of Australia reluctantly, grudgingly and with the greatest possible caution finally agreed to **federation**.

* Australia today is entering an era of development which was never envisaged when the first settlement took place less than two centuries ago, and which was not fully realised even at the time of **federation** 72 years ago.

* It is important in a **federation** such as ours with vast areas and with population spread mainly on the seaboard with a sparse scattering through the interior that transport have a very strong voice in the economic management of the country.

* Transport planning and transport expenditure ought to have a major priority in any **federation**.

* One of the arguments of the Opposition that I have noticed from a reading of such material is that the Senate is a States House at the moment and has been so since **federation**.

* Of course, I point out that the 1897 Convention was one of the conventions that led up to **federation**.

* The situation at **federation** was that the founding fathers did not debar anybody from being represented in the Senate.

* I believe that we want to be a **federation**; that the Northern Territory should advance to statehood and arrive at a position where is becomes a State as an equal partner in our Federation.

* This country has achieved greater uniformity in expenditure, in standards and in services than has any other **federation** in the world.

* The Liberal-Country Party Government spent more money on water conservation in its first 3 years in office than the Labor Party had spent on water conservation since **federation**.

* It is only in the Australian **federation** that one would ever use the word 'city' as a synonym for 'State capital'.

* In the American **federation** and in the Canadian **federation** one does not have this colonial definition of city' as a State capital.

* We intended right from the beginning- I am now in a position to make the announcement publicly- to set up a tripartite committee in every State consisting of a representative of the Trades and Labour Council, a representative of the employers **federation** and a representative of my Department, which will act as an overseeing committee - 
GMH makes the claim that the proposal will generate 3,000 jobs directly and a further 4,000 jobs indirectly.

* We opposed it even before the maps were presented because the ground rules had been changed unfairly for the first time since **federation**.

* It was decided to recommend to the Imperial Parliament that Australia become a Commonwealth, a **federation** of States.

* I for one find it inviting in terms of contemplation to look a century ahead when the United Kingdom may find itself by that time in some Heath Robinson like **federation** in Europe- a component in a European **federation**.

* I find it strange that this country should in that sense be bound legally to a component in that **federation**.

* The **federation** of Europe is a remarkable movement.

* The honourable member for Wills said what the Government should have done, but may I remind him that over the last few years the Government has done more to assist in the field of Aboriginal welfare than has any other government since **federation**; it does not have a bad record.

* The **federation**'s assertion is confirmed by 'The Sydney Morning Herald's' classified advertising section.

* The commercial breeders felt that they should get together for the benefit of the industry, but unfortunately attempts to form a **federation** failed time and again mainly because of a clash of personalities.

* I hope Australia finally has a building befitting the aspirations of this young country and, as the major building of the capital of Australia, to cap and to seal the **federation** and the movement towards **federation** which began so long ago.

* What a price to pay for the abandonment of a system which was worked out in 1910 and was based on very sound principles, because the founding fathers of **federation** well knew what had happened in New South Wales, of which originally this area formed a part, and the scandals associated with  Sir John  Robinson and everything that followed in that period.

* What should astonish honourable members opposite and the public in general is that in 1901 - that was at **federation** - Australia's population stood at 3.75 million.

* When he says that the Australian Labor Party is dedicated to the destruction of the federal system or of **federation**, obviously he has not read our policy, which provides for decentralised control and social control.

* I point out that we live in a **federation**.

* But it is very difficult for a nation to have coherent energy policies, particularly for a **federation**, if some parts of that **federation** are negligent in the way in which they handle the situation within their own States.

* In practising the principle of **federation** insofar as it leaves the right of establishing priorities to the States, this Bill leaves the Queensland Government responsible to the Queensland electorate as to whether the Bundaberg scheme should have been at the top of the water development projects in that State" required for Queensland's economic development.

* Has this man, who thinks he can run a **federation** on the basis of keeping tax money, completely forgotten his law?

* Some persons in the gallery might wonder why in the Australian **federation** we are still struggling to implement free hospitalisation which has been available in our sister **federation** of Canada for many years.

* Under **federation** the 
Over recent years there has been an extraordinary increase in the number of small organisations having political action as their mode of expression, and the overthrow of Liberal governments as their aim.

* Shortly after those arrests and the placing of charges I was most interested to receive a circular from the Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation of New South 
A spokesman for the Premier,  Mr Wran,  who is also the Minister for Police, said later that the company and the **federation** had applied to the Acting Commissioner of Police,  Mr J.  T. Lees, for the charges to be dropped.

* There is no doubt that in a **federation** the decisions of a Commonwealth government, the governments of the States, local government authorities, semigovernmental instrumentalities and private decisions both corporate and individual have a significant effect on the way in which our urban areas develop.

* As honourable members may be aware, the age qualification for candidature at Federal elections has been coincidental with the minimum age for enrolment and voting since **federation** and the Government takes the view that there is no logical reason to depart from the uniform age practice under Commonwealth electoral law.

* I should have liked him to have gone a little further on the question of **federation** and the Constitution.

* No, the question of **federation** which the honourable member for Bowman mentioned.

* It is an undeniable fact that the most important matter which is concerning all thinking Australians today is **federation** and the relationship between the Commonwealth Government and the States.

* Many people think of **federation** as one thing and the governments of the Commonwealth and the States as another thing.

* They seem to forget, of course, that **federation** is a union of the States.

* Very few people, including politicians and leaders of governments, have given much thought to the establishment and growth of **federation**, where it has led us and what should be done about it in the future.

* I think that a little thought on the development of **federation** is appropriate at this time.

* It was in this atmosphere that the great leaders of political thought realised that we must create a **federation** of States if we were ever to reach our destiny as a great nation.

* We all know of the turmoil and the difficulties experienced in bringing about **federation**, and it is interesting for everybody to read of those difficulties.

* Can anyone imagine what the position would be in this country today without **federation**?

* It was inevitable that we had to have a **federation**; otherwise it would have been impossible for this country to carry on in the way that it has.

* I believe, too, in the partnership of the States and the Commonwealth in a democratic **federation** with a common objective of maintaining and developing the Australian nation.

* I know there are people who believe that, but in my opinion it would have been a retrograde step to give this power to the States and would have been inimical to the best interests of **federation**.

* That was the original concept of **federation**.

* It is in this last field of policy and activity that the bonds of true **federation** must be exerted in the national interest.

* My appeal is to the Prime Minister of Australia and to the Premiers of the States throughout the whole of the **federation**.

* This is true **federation**, not the type with which we are dealing now.

* All we require is leadership not only in the Federal sphere but also from the Premiers of the States and our State elected representatives to get together on a true basis of **federation**.

* Yet the honourable member for Gippsland comes into this House tonight and tries to detract from what is undoubtedly a first in Australia's history since **federation**.

* We have had them since **federation**.

* At the time of **federation**, 1902, a 25 deposit was introduced.

* It was quite a lot of money in those days and certainly would have kept a lot of people from nominating 
The history of our very young **federation** bears witness to the truth of that.

* This Government has done more in 20 months for local government than any Federal Government since **federation**.

* The State Premiers and their Treasurers are still to negotiate on some of the fine points in relation to this new **federation** policy.

* During the last election campaign whenever I had the chance to put this new **federation** POliCY to areas in my electorate, people of all political colours were tremendously attracted by it.

* I am quite sure that the **federation** has not placed the facts clearly and properly before the pilots in the Northern Territory as it promised me it would do.

* -Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of a statement that Tasmania would be better in Canada under the Canadian system of **federation**?

* Presently the interest rates in Australia are the highest since **federation** 74 years ago.

* The Upper House was a concession to induce the colonies to accept **federation**.

* We have been subjected to a tirade of abuse and to assertions that the Government has not done enough and that after 69 years of **federation** we are still without water.

* It needs to be understood that this **federation** is a compact between six States.

* The States entered into the **federation** under certain terms and circumstances.

* The history of this country shows that since **federation** 70 years ago some wonderful men, by their wisdom and by what they did in this House, did much to build this nation.

* With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard a table showing the representation of the Australian Labor Party in Parliament since **federation**.

* Australia became a **federation** almost  70  years ago and since then the Australian Labor Party has occupied the treasury bench for only  16  years and  3  months.

* The third principle is that in a **federation** an effective system cannot be worked out without co-operation between State and Federal governments.

* There has been a refusal to recognise the constitutional right and position of the Senate; a refusal to recognise that Australia is a **federation** and despite the best efforts of this Government will remain a **federation**.

* He is painfully learning the fact that Australia is a **federation** with a distribution of powers appropriate to a **federation**.

* It is appropriate to recall that the Founding Fathers envisaged the future progress of the 6 States of Australia as along the course to a strong, independent, national outlook and possibly to the creation of more States within the **federation** as the population grew.

* It means a **federation**.

* As I said, in the 1890s some of the selfgoverning States, when considering **federation**, were not prepared to come into the Federation unless their position was safeguarded.

* That, of course, runs completely counter to the basis of our **federation** and to the structure that I have briefly outlined in my remarks.

* Is it a fact that one of the Bills now before the House, namely the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill, will take sovereignty from the States in certain areas that are now shown on Commonwealth produced maps as State territory - that is, areas acquired by the States since **federation** by reclamation, port or harbour development or any enlargement of internal waters as a result of the 1958 convention on the continental shelf?

* The union was a Commonwealth wide **federation** and the legislation made provision for one of the State branches of that union to opt out of the **federation** and shelter itself under the wing of the Department of Labour and National Service.

* Almost three-quarters of a century has passed since the debate, to which I have referred, on the adoption of the Constitution and the resulting **federation** of the 6 independent colonies.

* Today in accepting that role I ask honourable members to reflect for a few moments on the years since David Bowman, his colleagues in the Queensland Parliament and their counterparts in the parliaments of the other colonies debated the proposed **federation**.

* Often their interests and utterances and those of their State governments clearly indicate that **federation** is still a partially unacceptable concept.

* This Constitution which suited the **federation** of 6 independent colonies 70 years ago, which suited the growth and development of those colonies into States of the Commonwealth, no longer adequately suits the new visions and new concepts which we must adopt to permit our nation to face the next century, to provide for our future generations and for the role we must fill in this south east Asian section of our globe.

* As a further illustration of the fact that it was never intended by the founders of **federation** that a Territory should be represented by senators I again draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the debate of the 1897 convention on this very point.

* We believe that in a federal system an income tax is most easily and most equitably applied at one level; mat it does not lend itself to division according to the different levels of the **federation** because of the disparity in respect of resources; and that it is part of the job of a federal mechanism to equal se the differences.

* The State cancer organisations subscribe to a national **federation** - the Australian Cancer Society - which has limited funds for the purpose of co-ordinating the State activities and endowing certain national research programs.

* It requires careful consideration to ensure that the measure is appropriate to our **federation** and the proper protection of our environment.

* In fact, one often reflects that perhaps **federation** came too soon.

* We feel, as an Opposition, it would have been far preferable to give us a federal court that was dealing with all federal jurisdiction and not leave it in a situation which obviously had to develop at the time of **federation** that State courts would be exercising Federal jurisdiction.

* Now we have grown up as a **federation** we say that the situation is not as it was when that jurisdiction was vested in the State courts.

* No doubt pressure from the large open funds and the employers **federation** deleted these suggestions.

* One cannot consider it without taking into account the future of the Northern Territory in the whole Australian complex, in the Australian **federation**.

* I accept that the States have enormous problems, but I think that the question ultimately is one of how **federation** will work and how we as representatives of the people of Australia - not just the executive government - feel that this country should be run in the future.

* A national identity and the national co-operation of all the peoples of a country which has such a great and abiding future can be forged and achieved once it is acknowledged that within the Australian **federation** States and their governments are a system of representative regional government as capable of discerning and expressing the regional will of its people as this Government claims for itself over the national will of the nation.

* Instead it compounded them and the people poured such scorn upon it as has never been seen in our 75 years of **federation**.

* There are some who sit in the State parliaments and some indeed who sit in this Parliament who want to refight the battle of **federation**.

* But the colonies became the States under the compact of **federation**.

* Rights are not for sale and nor is **federation** a device for evading duties by splitting them between different levels of government.

* The proposed new police force is not really a **federation** of anything.

* As a nation we are now confronted with massive inflation and severe economic instability, the highest interest rates since **federation**, excessive increases in direct and indirect taxation, a crisis in the housing industry unparalleled since the immediate postwar period, record levels of industrial unrest, a severely reduced defence capability, a massive erosion of the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners, uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries, an immigration policy which has heaped confusion upon confusion and a breakdown in communication between the Government and the major constituent groups in the Australian community.

* I suppose that in 75 years of **federation** no Parliament has seen its like.

* It is the desire of people who live a long way from the seat of government and who feel sometimes that **federation** has failed.

* When the honourable gentlemen sitting opposite were in government they did more to increase the general administrative burden through various regulatory agencies on small business than did any other government in the history of **federation**.

* As events happened the Labor Party lost very narrowly in what was the most closely contested election in the history of our **federation**.

* -This Bill is a most important piece of legislation and it affects a probably unique body in any **federation** in the world which exists to look after the financial fortunes of the constituent parts of that **federation**.

* The Labor Government's and the Australian Labor Party's awareness of the responsibilities and the needs of local government and the role that local government had to play in the overall structure of the **federation** was reflected in the action that we took when we were in government.

* -In this debate on the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill, I will deal with four main points: Firstly, the Commonwealth 's generosity in relation to State finance; secondly, the historical background to the Bill; thirdly, the new federalism proposals that have been introduced by this Government and the new **federation** arrangements which have resulted; and, finally, Australia's economic problems, the role of the Commonwealth and the States and their recent records.

* Before leaving the point of instability in government which was one of the tragic results of that shameful episode, let me point out that a **federation** like ours, with the short 3-year terms, is the last place in the world which requires these extraordinary powers for the Senate.

* Australia joining in a **federation** it is the hope that the Federal Government will ensure that Australians are provided with uniform standards of service by their Government and have a uniform system of taxation to fund those services.

* If we go back through the annals of this Parliament since **federation** we find that we had our Doctor Moloney, our King O'Malley, our Eddie Ward and our Brennan.

* Events in this period of time were led and abetted by the Leader of the Opposition who has depraved, degraded and denigrated Parliament more than any other member of this House since **federation**.

* If members of the Government want to end industrial arbitration of the type which has existed in Australia since **federation** then let them stand up and say that this is what they want, instead of running around the corner and seeking divisive means such as the introduction of a productivity requirement in national wage judgments.

* We merely request that the amount of those transfers be known, calculated, measured and discussed within the Australian **federation**.

* There is something wrong with the distribution of resources within the economic **federation** of Australia.

* I have searched through perhaps the most important book on early **federation**, and that is the book written by Quick and Garran.

* I have been intrigued by the attitude which underlies the honourable member's speech, in that he was concerned about the position of the States in the **federation**.

* The ultimate reason for inter-governmental grants in a **federation** is a lack of balance between the financial powers and responsibilities of the different levels of government.

* The Government would certainly listen to any advice, criticism or recommendation from all bodies concerned, and would take such views into consideration when the industry **federation** comes up with a recommendation.

* Once again the Government found itself relatively naked in this crazy **federation**, operating this stupid system without sufficient tools to counter properly the trends that are befalling us.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal waters as they existed at **federation**, the States hare no such rights.

* In the case of a federal state, where for domestic purposes supreme legislative and executive power is divided between the **federation** and its component states or provinces, the question frequently arises whether the control of off-shore resources is exercisable, as a matter of internal constitutional law, by the **federation** itself, or by its component states or provinces, or is shared between both.

* Sir Robert  Menzies made the statement conceding that this was a matter of prime importance in our **federation**.

* He was as old at the time of **federation** as I was when I entered this Parliament.

* We are a **federation**, and we would make it work as a co-operative **federation**.

* The important Supreme Court case of Pollard's lessee v. Hagan in 1845 established that States entering the Union subsequent to the original **federation** were admitted on an equal footing and therefore acquired the same sovereign and proprietary rights in tidal lands and submerged lands under internal waters.

* It is most doubtful that this neglect of judicial history would be possible in an Australian court, especially if it is found that the States' boundaries were somehow frozen at colonial inception or at **federation**.

* States v. California case in 1947 it was not clear how these rights were divided in the **federation**.

* It is an adjudication which cannot be avoided in any **federation**.

* In summarising that particular case, once again this sort of adjudication is inevitable in any **federation**, given the need to define the baseline from which the territorial sea is to be measured, and given the concept of internal waters which are part of the land territory for legal purposes.

* Again, however, it is submitted that in the Australian **federation** it is unlikely that a court will be able to incorporate current international criteria into the Australian constitutional structure.

* Firstly, it is probable that the Australian States maritime boundaries, encompassing internal waters and possibly also the territorial sea, were fixed either at colonial inception or at **federation**.

* Secondly, there are many more component States in the American **federation**, with far more variegated and even colourful constitutional histories, than in the Australian **federation** where by contrast constitutional development has been fairly uniform.

* Surely this is the situation that faces the Government starkly in Australian **federation** at the moment.

* In a **federation**, it is distributed between central and State governments.

* They looked at the old South African provincial system and they said: 'This **federation** is not for us.

* Nevertheless, we do live in a **federation**, we do live in a country where we all call ourselves Australians, and perhaps reluctantly at times when I am supporting the very important dairy industry sector of my electorate I have to acknowledge that whatever mistakes have been made in the past the Victorians are in a situation, the Victorians are in a position where they, for better or worse, are producing relatively efficiently and they have to be thought of.

* This Bill will do nothing to alter the fundamental disabilities from which local government has suffered since **federation**.

* It may be viewed either as a loose confederation of quasi-independent states, or as a national **federation**.

* Our Constitution must be clear, dynamic and forward looking, and it must, in my opinion, serve the purpose of an Australian **federation** of States, and not preserve a confederation.

* It was a modest proposal, the main aim being to rationalise on a national basis those State government insurance offices which were prepared to come into the rationalisation, the **federation**.

* Also quite recently this organisation formed a **federation** in Bourke.

* In this respect our position in the Australian **federation** is unique, as the other States have road, rail, sea and air services available for use if they are needed.

* It recognised Tasmania's unique position in the Australian **federation** as regards its dependence on sea transport, the high proportion of export trade and the small domestic market.

* The Committee confirmed - these decisions by the Committee are important ones - that in terms of freight costs Tasmania is at a disadvantage relative to other States and that as an island State Tasmania has no interstate links except by sea and air and in this respect its position in the Australian **federation** is unique.

* Whilst the western miners of New South Wales have the highest rate of output per man now in Australia, I exhort the rank and file unionists to take a keen interest in the **federation** and the unions' policies to ensure that equity and common sense prevails at all times.

* (Opposition members interjecting)- 
Protected areas, not likely to develop in the direction of separate political existence within the **federation** - for example, Norfolk Island and Cocos Island.

* Australia is a **federation** similar to West Germany, the United States of America and other countries where the governments of those countries have complete power over the national economy.

* He announced that he would not seek another term in the Parliament if the Parliament ran its full course., Last September, the Federal Executive of my Party expelled the Victorian Branch of the Party from the **federation** which comprises the 6 State branches.

* The American Supreme Court has held that if you approbate the convention for the purposes of dealing with other nations and therefore accept this 24 miles mark you cannot in terms of the components or the elements of the **federation** reject it.

* But after all, we are living in a **federation** of States.

* In the United States of America, a much older **federation** than ours and a **federation** where the States have greater financial powers or resources than the States have in this country, there is no question as regards securities and exchange matters, for instance.

* The facts are of course that since **federation** there was until about 1960 a very consistent philosophy behind electoral redistributions and mostly they stuck pretty close to the quotas- not completely, but in the redistributions over that period they kept pretty close to the quotas.

* If the 20 per cent tolerance provided under the present Act - indeed since **federation** - violates a principle, then surely no-one will say that a 10 per cent tolerance does not violate the same principle of one vote one value.

* After more than 60 years of **federation** we find that our public servants still have the same amount of annual leave.

* They will continue to be deprived until the Commonwealth accepts in the Australian **federation** the degree of responsibility that is accepted by the Federal Administration in the United States, or the Federal  Government in Canada or in West Germany.

* Iti this **federation**, the amount of resources in the financial sense available to the Federal authorities is very much greater than that available to the federal authorities in West Germany, Canada or the United States.

* This is what I want to see for the people of Western Australia and that is why it seems fundamental to me that, when we live in a **federation** which is a **federation** of people as much as of States, those people should have a say in the wealth that is produced from the sea bed that lies off their shore.

* It is a view which we think is entirely responsible and consonant with preserving a proper balance between the roles of the Commonwealth Government and of the State governments in this **federation**.

* The real issue is whether in 1975 all political parties in Australia are prepared to accept that we are a **federation**, that we are going to remain a **federation**, and that we are not going to effectively solve many of the great social and economic problems we have unless there is an effective partnership between the Commonwealth and the States.

* Above all our policy towards federalism is this: It is all very well legally to divide power and responsibility in a **federation** but unless you give to each of the elements of government in a **federation** financial power to discharge their responsibilities the legal division will be illusionary and a fiction in many cases.

* In fact, had these provisions applied since **federation** only 2 additional referendums would have been carried.

* Queenslanders are paying dearly to be pan of the Australian **federation** .

* Australian **federation** such as we have today.

* Under the Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments increasingly the procedure has been evolved for saying that negotiations between Federal and State Ministers within the Australian **federation** must be confidential; that members of Parliament are not entitled to know what is being proposed.

* For example, in the United States of America- a **federation** quite similar to ours- there is a National Traffic Act and a National Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

* For example, in an article appearing in the Melbourne  Age  on 22 May, the dean of the law faculty of the University of Western Australia,  Dr A.  F. Dickey said: 
There has been ... a persistent sense that since Australia is a **federation** and since one of the most important aspects of the High Court's work is the resolution of Federal Constitutional issues, it would be at least fitting that judicial representation on the court should be more widespread.

* Essentially we must recognise that this is a **federation** and in a **federation** it is not for a federal government to say what it is about to do without being sure that it is able to do so through its constitutional and legislative capacity.

* Moreover, the role of the Government in this area certainly has become more significant in recent years than at any time since **federation**.

* I just want to say,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  that what has been done for Tasmania by the present Federal Government exceeds by a mile anything that has been done for our State in 79 years of **federation**.

* The people of the separate States joined in a **federation** at the turn of the century to become one nation for a very large number of good reasons.

* This is a **federation**, and the voice of the Queensland Government, and of any other State government for that matter, should be heard in matters that effect their State.

* Only five of 32 proposals had been accepted over the previous history of **federation** and then in one go three of four proposals were accepted.

* In fact, there has been pressure at each meeting of the **federation** that reports on all research projects should be provided with funds supplied by the research levy - the levy we are going to increase - and that the report should contain a brief description of each project, the status of the project, whether it has been completed, abandoned, deferred or is still continuing, and if abandoned or deferred the reason for such action.

* When that is done the Commonwealth will probably cease to be a **federation** and will be converted into a state that is national in form and structure and national in organisation.

* To me co-operative federalism implies that there must be sympathy and understanding between the Commonwealth and the States, the other constituent parts of the **federation**.

* All I am submitting is that the co-operation that is necessary for the smooth working of our **federation** has been severely weakened by the action that has been taken in this matter.

* The second thing which is significant is that because we have a federal system this ham-handed sort of play that has been allowed to continue has breached the relationships that ought to prevail between the centre and the component parts of a **federation**.

* It is an economic body which always deserves a quite special tribute because there is no other institution or economic mechanism like it in any other **federation** in the world and there is no other economic mechanism anywhere in the world which has been so successful, by its efforts, by its advice and by its investigations, in developing horizontal equality among the various parts of a nation.

* I point out that every **federation** which attends an international conference always has the problem - whether it is dealing with laws concerning discrimination on the ground of race, whether it is dealing with an International Labour Organisation Convention, or some other matter - that when it gets home the States will have to implement part of what it has agreed to.

* I am pleased to tell the House that the Customs Bureau has had detailed consultation with the Customs Agents Federation and that a detailed indication has been given to the **federation** of a procedure which will be adopted to accommodate examples where a genuine attempt has been made to comply with the terms of the new system of valuation but where, through no fault of those importers who are endeavouring to comply with it, some incorrect statement of value has been made.

* Those procedures have been explained in detail to the **federation** in a letter from the Comptroller of Customs.

* The Commonwealth from the outset indicated to the States that it would meet the full costs of any legal challenge in the High Court of Australia which is the supreme constitutional tribunal designed to elucidate great questions of law of such a kind as must inevitably arise in a **federation** for decision from time to time.

* There is no easy solution to the problems of a **federation** and fund raising where there is the type of diversity which exists between the government regions or the political units.

* It is in these particular types of situations that small problems can develop into major disputes, often because those employers and managers, due to their own lack of knowledge and ability in industrial affairs, rely completely on the employers **federation** to arrange settlement of any of their troubles.

* The employers **federation**, from my knowledge of the way in which it acted during my time in union affairs, was a past master in the tactics of delay.

* On several occasions I have been involved in such situations where the union, having failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the employer, has served a log of claims which in turn has been passed on to the employers' **federation**, as the employers' representative, to handle.

* The **federation** would invariably wait until the very last day which the Act allowed before it would lodge its answers.

* When at long last a hearing date was arranged the **federation**, on some fixed or flimsy excuse, would seek a postponement.

* Then eventually when the hearing was fixed, when it was heard and when the decision was brought down the **federation** would try to delay speaking to the Minutes.

* This was the way in which the **federation** really justified its existence in the eyes of the employers.

* The employers and the employers **federation** are well aware of this.

* 1 have no doubt that the amendment to which I have just referred has been inserted on the demand of the employers **federation**.

* But this type of settlement does not suit the employers' **federation** which in earlier years was able to wave the big stick and practically demand of employers what they should do or should not do.

* This Act was the result of discussions during the years immediately after **federation** when At was sought to adapt existing British legislation to Australian conditions.

* In the period since 1912 numerous considerations have been given to updating the Navigation Act to bring it more in line with the needs of a young and growing maritime **federation**.

* But I think it is important that we recognise that out of this assessment of the 2 prime groupings of the community, the Treasurer and those who frame the economic policy of this Government are pursuing a course which is directly contributing to inflation; a course which very much relates to the matter now a subject of debate in this chamber - the imposition by the Government of the highest and most onerous interest rates since **federation**.

* Uniform taxation was introduced in this country because we recognised, as a nation, that the States were so disparate and diverse, so unequal in their populations and their tax resources, that without a coordinating and overriding Federal responsibility for growth, welfare and development, the very ideal of **federation** would be at risk; pressures and disparaties among the States would produce a grossly unequal and therefore divided nation.

* It must be remembered that 3 weeks annual leave was established as standard for Commonwealth public servants at the time of **federation** nearly 70 years ago.

* Let me just draw his attent on to the fact that while this body of workers had 3 weeks' annual leave at the commencement of **federation** nearly 70 years ago.

* The Commonwealth public servants, of course, received the equivalent increase in the margins but their standard of annual leave remained at 3 weeks, which has been the standard since **federation**.

* whenever in one-fourth of the Divisions of the Stale the number of the electors differs from a quota ascertained in the manner provided in this Part to a greater extent than one-fifth more or onefifth less; 
1 ) What is the average term of office of (a) Members and ( b) Senators since (i) **federation**, (ii) 1 930 and (iii) 1 950.

* What proportion of (a) Members and (b) Senators attained at least 20 years service (including broken periods of service since (i) **federation**, (ii) 1 930 and (iii) 1 950.
